        "title": "30 Years of Acid Mt. Fuji: Celebrating Susumu Yokota\u2019s 303 Masterpiece \u2014 and His 1994 Releases as Yin & Yang and Ebi",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/30-years-of-acid-mt-fuji/",
        "content": "In 1994, the late Japanese electronic producer Susumu Yokota was just getting started but only a few years away from releasing a string of brilliant, inventive ambient electronic records that ditched the 4:4 stomp for luscious, textured meditative tracks on albums likeSakura,Magic Thread, andGrinning Cat. Then living in Berlin and working with the Sven Vath-connected Frankfurt label Harthouse, in 1993 Yokota had released his first album, called the Tokyo-Frankfurt Connection.\nAt the time, Berlin was in the midst of a non-stop post-reunification party enabled by newfound freedoms, the bounty of abandoned warehouse spaces \u2014 and a love affair with Detroit techno producers Juan Atkins, Derrick May, and Kevin Saunderson. The combustible Berlin energy helped define the sound of electronic dance music for decades to come. You can hear it on Yokota\u2019s acid-drenched 1993 track \u201cPanicwaves\u201d from Yokota\u2019s first project, called the Frankfurt-Tokyo Connection.\nThe late Yokota, who died in 2015, had an incredibly productive 1994, and little could he have known that, 30 years later, these tracks would serve as early reputation-building seeds that sprouted and blossomed and, like a time-lapse of a tulip, transformed at an incredible rate.\nCrucially, Yokota teased that progression on the astounding albumAcid Mt. Fuji. Originally issued by Japanese label Sublime on compact disc, in 2018 the Berlin label Midgar commenced a vinyl reissue campaign that included a few colored variants. That reissue remains a landmark, game-changing revelation, one that connects his Love Parade-inspired rave foundations and his inventive explorations of texture, melody, found sound, and ambient washes of sound to come.\nTo celebrate its 30th anniversary \u2014 which is on Saturday (June 29) \u2014 Sublime\u2019s parent company Musicmine has just issued a remastered version ofAcid Mt. Fuji.We\u2019re taking pre-orders on it in our shop.\nYokota was playing around with a few different monikers in \u201994, and each reveals a different aspect of the producer\u2019s growing aesthetic. For the Japanese label Frogman, he issued a mesmerizing EP as Yin & Yang. It\u2019s dense with 303 squiggles and foreshadows his love for vocal samples by employing a choir snippet.\nFor the German label Space Teddy, Yokota took on the name Ebi to create the truly magnificent, and yet to be reissued, albumZen. Eleven mesmerizing, softer acid tracks, it suggests a way forward for his more contemplative side.\nHere\u2019s an excerpt from the notes to the remastered Acid Mt. Fuji vinyl edition.\n\u2018Acid Mt. Fuji\u2019 is an enchanting mix of mystical ambient acid and futurist minimal techno, taking the listeners on a psychedelic pilgrimage, where 303, synths and electronic percussion are scented with reverb, echo and forest recordings. Merging Japanese new age and sparse electronica, the recording is free, organic, and energized \u2013 proffering a unique blend of early 90s western styles and the essence of his home country.\nYokota originally planned an ambient record, but \u2018Acid Mt. Fuji\u2019 evolved into a concept work featuring the Roland TB-303, which he recorded live at home alongside a sampler, yielding experimental and innovative results.\nThe long player found its muse in the famed 18th-19th century artist Hokusai\u2019s red rendition of Mt. Fuji, known as \u2018Red Fuji\u2019 or \u2018Akafuji\u2019. Part of the painter\u2019s renowned \u2018Thirty Six Views of Mt. Fuji\u2019 series from the 1830s, \u2018Red Fuji\u2019 depicts the iconic sacred mountain aglow in red at dawn, symbolizing spirituality and creativity. With references to Japanese folklore, nature and shrines, tracks like \u2018Kinoko\u2019 and \u2018Meijijingu\u2019 invite the listener to immerse themselves in the album\u2019s spiritual depths.\nYokota\u2019s own homage-to-Hokusai drawing graces the record\u2019s cover, and was inspired by the concept of wa (harmony) \u2013 highlighting his diverse skills not only as a musician, but an artist and designer too.\nThis remastered vinyl reissue will likely go fast. If you want to pre-order it,you can do so here."

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/todd-rundgren-selects/",
        "content": "I recently picked up a Japanese music book titledTodd Rundgren \u2013 Born to Synthesize. Published in 1997, the book traces Rundgren\u2019s musical career from his early days with his legendary band Nazz through the multitudes of projects he has worked on in the music industry as singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, producer, computer programmer, and more. The book includes some amazing photos of Rundgren, including some taken in 1997 at his studio in Hawaii, along with words from the man himself spread throughout the book. There are a number of incredibly in-depth pieces in the book (I wouldn\u2019t expect anything less from Japanese music researchers), but one of my personal favorite sections is \u201cTodd\u2019s Selected 5 Discs\u201d where the Philly-born artist shares his favorite records from different genres. Below, I\u2019ve transcribed and roughly translated two of the sections. Think of it as an archival edition of our5 Selectsseries\u2026\nTodd Rundgren will be performing at the Saban Theater this Thursday, June 20th:https://wheremusicmeetsthesoul.com/events/todd-rundgren-me-we-beverly-hills-june-2024/\nTodd is well known for his love of Philly soul, and for this section we asked him to select five of his favorite blues, R&B, and soul albums.\nTodd: When I was listening to this kind of music in the \u201960s, blues and soul were the same thing in my mind. It\u2019s a category with a wide range of tolerance. The first song I fell in love with was Albert King\u2019sThe Hunter, which was included in his \u201cBorn Under a Bad Sign.\u201d This is probably the most R&B song on the album. This guy was really influential to me at the time.\nI also liked the O\u2019Jays\u2019Dawn of Light. This is the album that includes \u201cFor the Love of Money,\u201d which Ilater coveredin 1982.\nWhen it comes to white R&B, I like the British band Spencer Davis Group. I especially like their first album released in America. The band\u2019s performance was alright, but Steve Winwood\u2019s singing was truly amazing. I think their popularity was largely due to Steve\u2019s vocals. I feel like we white people have learned a lot from the Spencer Davis Group.\nI was also heavily influenced by Stevie Wonder\u2019s albumSigned, Sealed & Delivered. I learned a lot by imitating his vocal style. I also learned a lot from Marvin Gaye, of course.\nIn terms of white soul, I guess I like the Average White Band\u2019sWhite Album. There were two great singers in that band. One was Hamish Stewart, who was in Paul McCartney\u2019s band. \u201cYou Got It\u201d is the best track.\nTodd was featured on Thelonious Monk\u2019s tribute album:That\u2019s the Way I Feel Now. Surprisingly, he also seemed to listen to a lot of jazz. In this corner, we asked him to select his five favorite jazz albums.\nTodd: I didn\u2019t even know that jazz music existed until I was 17 years old. But once I discovered jazz, it was always there for me.\nI became friends with a counselor at a summer camp in Pennsylvania. He showed me Horace Silver\u2019sSongs for My Father, which was the first jazz record that appealed to me.\nI was very impressed when I first heard Bill Evans on the radio. I bought the record and listened to it over and over again. His music has been a great influence on me.\nJimmy Smith was light jazz, but I quite liked him. In fact, his song \u201cWhen Johnny Comes Marching Home\u201d influenced \u201cHello It\u2019s Me.\u201d It\u2019s originally a traditional song, but he added an intro to it. I was able to use the song\u2019s ever-changing style in my own way.\nI also like a lot of Weather Report albums. Here, I\u2019d like to recommendI Sing the Body Electric, which features Roger Powell.\nDonald Fagen\u2019sNightflyis considered a pop album, but I think it\u2019s best viewed in terms of the jazz elements of his songwriting. It\u2019s connected to the jazz of the 1990s."

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/don-cherry-appreciation/",
        "content": "The Oklahoma City-born, Los Angeles-raised horn player Don Cherry has been consuming a lot of research and turntable time over the past few months, at least in this particular satellite ISC listening room. An artist who worked with genius instrumentalists including Ornette Coleman, John Coltrane, Sonny Rollins, Albert Ayler, Charlie Haden, Nana Vasconcelos, Ed Blackwell, the Watts Prophets, James Blood Ulmer and dozens more, Cherry came up in the thriving LA jazz scene, and was educated at a young age through formative interactions with trumpeter Clifford Brown, saxophonist Eric Dolphy and drummer Max Roach.\nAfter establishing himself with experts including Coleman and Coltrane, Cherry developed ideas about music that would drive him toward the kind of collaborations the leapt borders.\n\u201cWell, one thing is that it\u2019s actually not my music, because it\u2019s a combination of different experiences different cultures and different composers that involves the music that we play together alone,\u201d Cherry says to open a 1978 Swedish TV documentary on him. A beautifully shot and recorded hour-long film, it travels from OKC to Long Island City to Sweden and features killer street performances and improvisations. (See below.)\nThe thing about Cherry is that the more you dig, the more you realize the profound breadth and depth of his work. Across his amazing creative life, he worked with jazz masters, yes, but he also actively straddled and embraced sounds from across musical and geographical realms. Cherry\u2019s discography includes recordings with Terry Riley, Lou Reed, Krzysztof Penderecki, Ian Dury, Fela Kuti, La Monte Young\u2019s Theater of Eternal Music (Dream Syndicate), step-daughter Neneh Cherry and director Alejandro Jordorowsky.\nThat\u2019s correct: Cherry worked with Jordorowsky on the soundtrack toThe Holy Mountain, which, if you\u2019ve never heard, should be in this week\u2019s listening queue. Take \u201cPissed and Passed Out,\u201d for example.\n\u201cI myself, man, I don\u2019t believe in\u2014I don\u2019t think of competition in music, you know. I don\u2019t think of something being better or worse, it\u2019s just different,\u201d Cherry said in that hour-long documentary. \u201cAnd I think that this kind of thing brings a certain ego that is keeping a lot of \u2026 musicians from coming together, you know?\u201d\nThe musician, who died in 1995, embraced collaboration and rejected ego-driven ideas on music and he derided artists who were going \u201cout there\u201d for thoughtless, competitive reasons. \u201cEveryone wants to feel that they\u2019re doing something different than everyone else is doing, and everyone wants to be an innovator. And all the innovators that I\u2019ve known in my life \u2014 John Coltrane, Albert Ayler, Ornette, and many others, Eric Dolphy \u2014 they all were playing their music and trying to develop in music. It wasn\u2019t to try to be an innovator. It so happens they were innovators, but they weren\u2019t intentionally trying to be innovative.\u201d\nFor example, at the 1973 Jazz Jamboree in Warsaw, Poland, Cherry gathered a group that mixed eastern and western instruments: Dodou Gouriand (soprano sax); Christer Both\u00e9n (doussn\u2019guni, tenor sax); Bobo Stensson (piano); Jane Robertson (cello); Palle Danielsson (bass) Bengt Berger (drums, tabla); Moki Cherry  (tamboura). (That\u2019s Moki and Don\u2019s son Eagle-Eye Cherry front and center.) Incredibly innovative, Cherry\u2019s skill was in finding musicians of similar artistic temperaments but wildly divergent experiences.\nBelow: Cherry live at the Empire Theatre in Paris, 1979 with musicians he met playing with Lou Reed\u2019s band while they were making Reed\u2019s album The Bells: Marty Fogle (soprano and tenor sax, flute), David Torn (electric guitar), Bruce Yaw (bass) and Trilok Gurtu (tabla, drums, percussion).\nSeven years later, a crew captured an astounding set from 1986 that occurred at the Palacio de los Deportes de San Sebasti\u00e1n in the Basque region of Northern Spain. Cherry loved percussion, and this band featured two legendary players working side by side: Ed BlackweIl and Nana Vasconcelos. Also playing: Cherry on pocket trumpet and the Malian stringed instrument the douss\u2019n-gouni, Carlos Ward on flute and alto sax and Mark Helias on bass.\nIt Is Not My Musicis the documentary mentioned above. Produced and directed by Urban Lasson, according to notes it captures \u201cDon and Moki Cherry and others who lived with them in the school house in T\u00e5garp, Sk\u00e5ne, Sweden, in the 1970s and onwards. It includes sequences from SoHo, New York, and Moki Cherry\u2019s textiles on the walls in H\u00e4stveda and Long Island City \u2026 with Rashied Ali, James Blood Ulmer, Nana Vasconcelos, Denis Charles, Huss Charles, etc.\u201d"

        "content": "Although you should obviously pay attention to the visuals on Elemental 7, the 1983 video album by Chris & Cosey, the musical score itself is something to behold \u2014 as a focused, uninterrupted listen will confirm. A series of seven textured electronic pieces that ripple with tripped-out sampled voices, chirpy ascending synth notes, church bells, loops, booms, and proto-EBM, pre-darkwave jams, the hour-long videotape remains a remarkable document from an important moment in the marriage of video art and experimental music.\nCo-founders of Throbbing Gristle, the husband-wife team of Cosey Fanni Tutti and Chris Carter evolved into an influential force in electronic dance music. In the late 1960s, Cosey and Throbbing Gristle bandmate Genesis P. Orridge formed art collective COUM Transmissions, and provoked outrage in the British media after their sexually charged public performance of a provocative show called Prostitution. They further provoked after forming, with Carter and Peter Christopherson, Throbbing Gristle. After that group\u2019s demise, Chris and Cosey turned to sound and visual work. Harnessing synth rhythms and washes of samples, they created music inspired by Martin Denny-esque exotica, krautrock, and environmental music.

It was then transferred to Umatic for editing and post production.\n\u201cElemental 7\u201d was shot in 1982 and not edited to its final form until September 1983. The soundtracks were recorded at Studio 47 in 1982 and completed for release in September 1983.Special thanks go to Mr. Evans.\nThe quality and content of this recording cannot and should not be compared with conventional, commercial recordings.

        "content": "One of the more underrated progressive rock groups from the \u201970s Canterbury Scene, Matching Mole was a short-lived project led by Robert Wyatt after he left Soft Machine in 1971. Matching Mole, which is a play on the French translation of Soft Machine \u201cMachine Molle,\u201d would feature Wyatt\u2019s inimitable drums and vocals alongside David Sinclair of Caravan on organ and piano, Dave MacRae on electric piano, Phil Miller of Delivery on guitar and the great Bill MacCormick of Quiet Sun on bass. The group released a pair of albums in 1972. Our personal favorite is the self-titled one, mostly because of the amazing album artwork which featured a pair of cute illustrated moles that look like they could\u2019ve have been plucked right out of the frog and toad universe.\nThat same year, Matching Mole would tour across Europe supporting Soft Machine, who were at the peak of their popularity. Amazingly, a few of these performances were captured on video including this performance on French television program Rockenstock. After years playing shirtless with Soft Machine, Wyatt puts on a Matching Mole t-shirt here and what looks like aWaq\u2019ollo Mask, traditionally used in Latin American dance celebrations. His creative genius on both vocals and drums are on full display as he starts the set off with some wild vocal improvisations first squeaking creature-like sounds into the microphone then going into a sort of bluesy bit before landing on a heavily echo\u2019d out sequence of \u201ctesting 1,2.\u201d The scene is totally weird, mesmerizing, and made even better by the bored looking French audience members.\nBelow, watch Matching Mole perform heavily improvised renditions of \u201cGloria Gloom\u201d fromMatching Mole\u2019s Little Red Recordand \u201cPart of the Dance\u201d fromMatching Mole.\nIf you\u2019re unfamiliar with Matching Mole, we highly recommend listening to their 1972 self-titled album."

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/boban-petrovic/",
        "content": "\u201cThe party is an incredibly complex institution,\u201d the yacht-living, Lamborghini-driving Serbian disco-funk producer Boban Petrovi\u0107 said in reissue liner notes for his 1981 album\u017dur. He was discussing his life as a Belgrade entertainer, host, ladies\u2019 man, and dance floor groover starting in the 1970s.\nA bon vivant who, the story goes, has delivered truckloads of free beer to fans of his football club and once bought 450 bottles of Dom Perignon for more than 4,000 party-goers, Petrovi\u0107 became what Belgrade writer-DJ Bege Fank called the \u201csymbol of Yugoslav and Belgrade Funk and a flamboyant member of the global jet set.\u201d\nAt the time\u017durcame out, Belgrade was the capital of the former Yugoslavia and a Soviet-bloc country, one with an approach to communist government that afforded rich arts and culture scenes. Petrovi\u0107 seems to have grown up among relative wealth, at least according to his recollection of the Belgrade disco scene of the 1970s and \u201880s.\n\u201cI was privileged with always being able to organize my parties at the residencies of ambassadors\u2019 sons and daughters all around Belgrade, because I didn\u2019t have my space where I could accommodate, let\u2019s say, a hundred people,\u201d he said. \u201cThis slowly grew into the first business I started \u2013 the disco clubs. For me, the disco club was nothing but a party everyone could attend. It bothered me seeing the same people often at my parties. And then again, some people would come over and we didn\u2019t let them in because we didn\u2019t know them well or we didn\u2019t know them at all.\u201d\nThe solution: He created a series of spots designed for such interactions, one that played to Petrovi\u0107\u2019s strengths as what he calls \u201ca talented \u2018smoke and mirrors\u2019 seller, although in a positive manner.\u201d\nLast month, the Austrian reissue label Everland resurrected Petrovi\u0107\u2019s 1981 album\u017durand hired audio engineer Jessica Thompson (Awesome Tapes from Africa, Numero Group, Smithsonian-Folkways) to make it shimmer.\nIn notes accompanying its return, Everland described the album as being set in the artist\u2019s comfort zone: \u201cHe is at home, in his safe place, since the\u00a0parties, the music and the people are the first out of many things he had completely figured out in his life. He is at the top of his game, occasionally bothered by a casual heartbreak, but always feeling himself, coming out playful and fundamentally peaceful, satisfied and ready to transcend himself in order to put the rest of the world in the limelight.\u201d\nWriterBege Fank asked the artistabout this.\nBege Fank:It\u2019s great that we\u2019ve mentioned the structure of the album \u2026 [I]t is, in fact, an album about getting ready for the party and the actual party experience of a non-ordinary Belgrade disco king.\nBoban Petrovi\u0107: Yes\nWhich is you.\nWell, am I a disco king? I say \u201cYes.\u201d You say \u201cdisco king,\u201d and I jump in offbeat with my \u201cyes\u201d [smiles]. No, I was saying \u201cyes\u201d to the comment that this album is a contribution to the musical expression of my idea of the party and the importance of the party.\nMusic didn\u2019t earn Petrovi\u0107 enough bank to live the life he felt he deserved, so he became, as release notes describe it, \u201ca businessman of the conscious class \u2026 He was living in Spain on his own luxury yacht for years. He had a private airplane, a car park. But all this time living on highest class level he never lost his identity.\n\u201cIn all his offices, yacht, airplane and everywhere was \u2026 loud funk music, and he was dressed like a musician who just finished or needs to start a gig.\u00a0Along the way Boban also wrote two books:Rokanje 1 & 2,describing the time when the album\u017durwas created.\u201d\nMore info on Everland\u2019s reissues should hit their Bandcamp. The label goes deep in its quest for global curios.\nRevisit our collection writeup for Petrovi\u0107\u2019s sophomore album Zora."

        "title": "How Silver Apples Harnessed World War II Oscillators to Create the First Electronic Rock Record",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/silver-apples/",
        "content": "At the end of World War II, the US military loaded up all the equipment it used for communication and warfare against the Nazis and brought it back to the US. Included within all that decommissioned surplus \u2014 which was auctioned off, repurposed for civilian use and sold in surplus stores \u2014 was a feast of radio gear and audio oscillators. Used to jam Nazi communications by beaming disruptive audio frequencies at enemy channels, oscillators started flooding the market in the 1950s and 1960s.\nYour average citizen couldn\u2019t have cared less about oscillators, but those with a knack for rudimentary electronics who were also musicians and/or sound appreciators started harnessing oscillators to make music. In the East Village in 1967, a young singer named Simeon Coxe started playing around with one. Hetold the storyto Portishead\u2019s Geoff Barrow in a 2010 interview for Clash:\nI had a friend who was what we call a serious music conductor and composer but he was very much into messing around and experimenting with electronic music that I knew absolutely nothing about. I used to go over to his house and watch him drink vodka and play Beethoven records and he had this oscillator thing that he would play through the stereo system. One time he drank so much vodka that he passed out, so I put a Rolling Stones record on and tried to play the oscillator along with it. I decided then and there that I was going to introduce it to my band at the time.\nHe did. The band was so disinterested in his oscillations that it broke up instead.\nDrummer Dan Taylor, however, was intrigued. Soon, Coxe and Taylor dubbed themselves Silver Apples and started gigging around the Village. \u201cWe were dirt poor and used what we had, which was often discarded World War II gear,\u201d Coxetoldthe Guardian in 2019, a year before his death. The machine he eventually Frankensteined together was called \u201cThe Simeon,\u201d and at its peak was powered by nine audio oscillators and 86 manual controls. Simeon played it with his hands, elbows and feet, creating, mixing and manipulating melody, rhythm and bass pulses.\n\u201cSometimes I would make two or three oscillators drone right through the whole thing and play some rhythm with my elbow on the telegraph keys and then play lead oscillator during breaks,\u201d he said. The sound they made on their self-titled 1968 debut,Silver Apples, predated White Noise\u2019sAn Electric Stormby a year and Kraftwerk\u2019s first album by two.\nThe first time Barrow heard Silver Apples, he was stunned \u2014 or, as he said, \u201c\u2018Fucking hell, this is amazing.\u2019 For people like us, they are the perfect band. Silver Apples were a pathway to Portishead. They should definitely be up there with the pioneers of electronic music.\u201d\nFor a while, Silver Apples were house band at Max\u2019s Kansas City, the great club in the Flatiron District near Union Square. The same year that the band released its self-titled debut, Coxe was approached by underground theater producer/promoter John Vaccaro, who had founded the sex-positive Playhouse of the Ridiculous Troupe. \u201cAfter a while, he asked if we would be interested in doing an insane musical,\u201d Coxesaidin an interview with Little Village magazine. \u201cRight up our alley! What a beautiful but bizarre bunch of folks.\u201d The musical was calledCockstrong, and Silver Apples delivered the sonics. Unfortunately, recordings of the performances, if there were any, seem to be lost to time.\nWhat\u2019s not lost to time, but closely guarded, is a two-track tape of Silver Apples and Jimi Hendrix working on \u201cThe Star Spangled Banner\u201d in the period just before Hendrix busted it out at Woodstock. The Apples and Hendrix were friends before the latter became famous, and spent time in the studio together. Portishead\u2019s Barrow asked Coxe about the tape.\n\u201cYeah, the tapes would sometimes roll when we were playing together and some of that has survived,\u201d Coxe said. \u201cWe found a two-track dub of Hendrix and me working on the \u2018Star Spangled Banner.\u2019 Danny had taken it home to try and figure out a way to put a drum part to it because the way Jimi and I played it was almost non-rhythmical. So there was no beat to it but there could have been a way to put percussion effects all through it if we had wanted.\u201d\nCoxe added that Hendrix loved the sound Silver Apples were making, and that Hendrix \u201cencouraged me to keep going because he would get even more dissonant and out of range with his guitar than I could get with an oscillator, so I was trying to be as crazy as he was. Having played the banjo, I was aware of bluegrass progressions.\u201d\nCoxe, in fact, busts out his banjo on the band\u2019s 1969 second album,Contact. It\u2019s a wild combination, especially how he utilizes the banjo\u2019s fifth string.\n\u201cI was aware of the importance of drones,\u201d Coxe told Barrow. \u201cThe fifth string on the banjo is nothing but a drone-string and a rhythm string, but you don\u2019t ever play but the one note with it. So it was okay in my head that I would have an oscillator that started at the beginning of the song and didn\u2019t stop until the end of the song and never change that note once. It was like filling up an empty space.\u201d\nBarrow interjected: \u201cWe call it glue.\u201d\n\u201cGlue\u2019s a good way of describing it,\u201d said Coxe.\nOn Monday atIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing NYC, our Monday Dedicated Listening session will highlight that debut Silver Apples record and seven other psych-rock gems.

        "title": "Tellus Audio Cassette Magazine: Portable NYC Art from the Walkman Era",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/tellus-audio-cassette-magazine/",
        "content": "In 1981 New York City, the artist Joseph Nechvatal obtained a compilation album calledJust Another Asshole #5. Curated by the artist-musician Barbara Ess (Y Pants) and the composer Glenn Branca, it was an extension of their zine of the same name. The album\u2019s two sides featured a total of 77 pieces by a who\u2019s who of the art and noise scenes of the time, including Laurie Spiegel, Eric Bogosian, Peter Gordon, Phil Niblock, and Jenny Holzer. Of particular note: the three founding members of Sonic Youth each contributed a brief piece, and did so as they were forming the band.\nNechvatal was an active member of the downtown New York scene. His focus was on sound art. At the time, the Sony Walkman was transforming the notion of listening to recorded music. Formerly tethered to a home stereo and turntables, music on cassette allowed music freaks to soundtrack their commutes with sounds of their own choosing.\nInspired, in Nechvatal\u2019s words, \u201cby the idea that you could just bring your friends and neighbors and other artists on the scene at the moment into a compilation,\u201d he and fellow artist Carol Parkinson launched Tellus Audio Cassette Magazine, a subscription service that produced lovingly edited mixes of music, sound art and spoken word to create hour-long compilations.\n\u201cI could give New York City a certain soundtrack depending on my emotional needs,\u201d NechvataltoldPaul Paulun of the website Sounds Central. \u201cWe lived in a new sort of sonic vibratory environment, and it was interesting to address that as a possibility for contemporary art.\u201d\n\u201cI wanted to incorporate cassettes into mail art,\u201d Nechvatal told the Quietus. \u201cThe idea was we would just send something to usually a colleague or a friend or someone you wanted to exchange work with. It was just the beginning of the cassette underground culture, where people were doing similar things. Because you could not only play cassettes, you could record on the boombox and on the Walkman, so you had a production tool and a distribution tool in the same little box \u2013 and it was not even that expensive.\u201d\nThe aim, added Parkinson on Celsius Drop, Mark \u201cFrosty\u201d McNeil\u2019s show on dublab, was to amplify \u201cadventurous audio that was outside the radio medium, the kinds of sounds and music that we were interested in.\u201d\nThe creators behind Tellus spent the next decade regularly issuing cassette comps, in the process documenting a singular moment in New York noise (and beyond). The first tape, which came out in 1983, featured early work by Sonic Youth peers Rhys Chatham, Rat At Rat R and Live Skull alongside found sound recordings and audio collages. Here\u2019s Sonic Youth\u2019s entry:\n\u201cTellus told us there were others like us,\u201d sound artist Gen Ken Montgomery wrote of his encounters with the cassette series. As he recalled in the liner notes to a double-LP compilationTellus Tools, \u201cIn the early \u201880s if you were working on the fringe area between art and music, without the means to have a record label produce your work, putting sounds onto cassettes and mailing them to friends was something everyone could do.\u201d Forty years later, subscription series and cassette culture are both thriving in an entirely different technological environment, one in which we\u2019re all tethered, by choice, to our post-Walkman electronic devices.\nBoth YouTube and Archives.org have listening copies of Tellus tapes, and we recommend total immersion in them. One great place to start is #12. CalledTellus Dance, it\u2019s a miraculous mess of beats and oblong rhythms by artists including Liquid Liquid (and the group\u2019s Richard McGwire), Parkinson, and others.\nHere\u2019s No. 13, which is devoted to Power Electronics.\nAnd, finally, here\u2019s a video by Nechvatal that illustrates one of many fascinating works that he\u2019s created. He provides an overview of the work, which was created in 2011, in the notes: \u201cThe audio track is 15:56 minutes of Reed\u2019sMetal Machine Music (side 4) compressed into 1 minute and 6 seconds. The money paintings, being eaten by my C++ viral-modeled artificial life software, are by Andy Warhol.\u201d"

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/loren-mazzacane-connors-haino-keiji/",
        "content": "Few guitarists approach their instrument with the delicacy of Loren Mazzacane Connors, and fewer still have created their own musical language, one immediately identifiable but distant and elusive nonetheless. The New York-based artist, who first started releasing blues-adjacent solo music as Guitar Roberts in the 1970s, has issued dozens of albums and played with countless artists over the years, including collaborations with Jim O\u2019Rourke, Kim Gordon, David Grubbs, Darin Gray (more on that below) and his longtime creative and life partner Suzanne Langille.\nThose who have never gone deep into Mazzacane Connors\u2019 work have an entire realm of sublime beauty awaiting you. Every reverb-drenched note is sacred. Connors\u2019 fretboard micro-movements make tones shimmer as they bend, moan as they echo.\nIn 2022, a recording surfaced of a magical moment in the history of transcontinental solo electric guitar music. Visiting New York from Tokyo, the Japanese player Haino Keiji made a pilgrimage to the home of Connors and Langille, whose work had inspired and moved him. Keiji\u2019s playing style couldn\u2019t have been more different. At the time, he was best known for his work with Fushitsusha and P.S.F. Records. It was distorted and abrasive. Mazzacane Connors\u2019 approach could be abrasive, but not the way Haino\u2019s was. The visit was documented by Linsey Herman, who recently rediscovered a tape she\u2019d thought lost. (The David Newgarden she mentions in the caption below is best known for his work with John Zorn on Tzadik Records.)\nHaino Keiji came to the US in 1991 at the invite of John Zorn, I believe. I was still in college and took my Hi8 video camera with me everywhere. Haino had told me he was a big fan of Loren Mazzacane Connors/Guitar Roberts and wanted to meet him during his visit. My friend David Newgarden knew Loren, and offered to introduce Haino to him. The three of us \u2013 me, David, and Haino, went to Loren and Suzanne\u2019s apartment and watched as they performed a concert just for us (and their son, who can be seen in the video). I thought this tape was long gone, but here it is. Though Haino isn\u2019t much in it, you can hear him and see him just a bit.\nThis was the first meeting that eventually led to the Mazzacane/Haino recording that Persona Non Grata (the label David Newgarden and I briefly ran) released with Father Yod.\u2014Linsey Herman\nYouTube has a number of stunning recordings of Mazzacane Connors in concert. In 1992, the guitarist was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s Disease, which over the decades has made it increasingly difficult to travel. Still, last year he performed in London at Cafe Oto with Alan Licht.\nSome of my favorite Mazzacane Connors collaborations are those with bassist Darin Gray, whose credits illuminate his stature: Over the years he\u2019s worked with geniuses including O\u2019Rourke, Eiko Ishibishi, Akira Sakata, Gastr del Sol, Oren Ambarchi, Tweedy, and dozens more. If you see his name in the liner notes, it\u2019ll be a good record.\nIn 2000, Mazzacane Connors and Gray performed together in Bloomington, Indiana, home of the experimental label Family Vineyard. The set occurred at the Monroe County Public Library and was shot to video using a two-camera set-up. Better, Family Vineyard\u2019s recording of it came out a year later asThis Past Spring. The liner notes for the Family Vineyard release are \u2026 ahem \u2026 very well written. As a young scribe in 2000, Gray and Mazzacane Connors asked me to write them. (Gray and I go way, way back.) Since I\u2019ve already written about the set, here\u2019s part of what I wrote.\nA standing-room-only crowd remained hushed throughout (\u201cWhen I looked up about halfway through the set, I could not believe that that many people could be that quiet at a show \u2013 really a moving experience,\u201d says Gray), and recording engineer Daniel Burton attended to the sound \u2013 a remarkable feat considering MazzaCane Connors\u2019 sense of dynamics and his ability to move from moan to whimper and back again without warning.\nYou can hear two people, their instruments, an audience and a library inside the same moment, shaping a present as though it were a malleable object, transforming it, conversing with it, appreciating it and, ultimately, transcending it by simply living within it. No small feat, and though free improvisation is a game that anyone can play, it takes two musicians who understand each other \u2013 and dynamics \u2013 to transform it into something huge and profound. Connors and Gray\u2026are able to converse without shouting \u2013 though, as you\u2019ll hear within, shouting is sometimes necessary \u2013 are able to needle through each other without shock or trepidation. You can hear this relaxation, this ease of delivery, this respect. It shapes the moment.\nLooking to dig further? O\u2019Rourke and Mazzacane Connors\u2019 duets album is another collaboration to get lost in. Recorded live and calledIn Bern, its song titles are among the best ever for a live record.\n1 Now Who Are These Guys? 5:202 Still Going \u2026 19:373 Are They Going To Stop? 13:464 You Can Stay If You Want, But I\u2019m Going Home"

        "content": "Haruomi Hosono released his fourth solo album,Paraiso,on April 25, 1978, three short months after he and members of his Yellow Magic Band recorded it at Tokyo studios Alfa and Crown. A funky AOR fusion record that Hosono describes in the liner notes to Light in the Attic\u2019s reissue as being \u201cmade under very calm circumstances,\u201d its nine songs reflect the sound of contemporary Tokyo at the time. \u201cSession work was all fusion,\u201d Hosono said, calling it \u201cstill a time when music couldn\u2019t be made without musicians.\u201d\nSo taken with the results and collaboration was Hosono that he and two members of that studio band, Ryuichi Sakamoto and Yukihiro Takahashi, entered Alfa that July to record their first album as Yellow Magic Orchestra. Those six months in 1978 were a crucial creative explosion, the kind that reverberates not just across the years but across the decades.\nAlmost exactly a year after the trio first entered the studio as Yellow Magic Orchestra, they traveled to Los Angeles to record. Their debut US performance was on Aug. 4, 1979 at the Greek.\nHosono discussed his first impressions of Los Angeles during aninterviewwith Yosuke Kitazawa for Vinyl Me Please. \u201cWe recorded at the famous Sunset Sound studio, did a session with Van Dyke Parks, observed Little Feat recordingDixie Chicken\u2014 it was an important learning experience,\u201d he said. \u201cOther than that, we bought a bunch of records and ate a lot of hash browns at Denny\u2019s. I was 22 at the time. Why do American records sound good? Is it the electricity? Is it the magnetic fields? Those are the kind of questions we were asking each other every day. Back then America felt so far from Japan culturally, and I had a strong admiration toward it. But not so much now. It\u2019s the same with Japan too. I wonder what changed so much\u2026\u201d\nSolo albums exist within a very selfish world, so they can only be made from your own natural desires. Creating something for others \u2014 that sense doesn\u2019t exist in the solo world.\nHosono added that producer Van Dyke Parks taught him production techniques. \u201cWhat I learned from the maestro was the method of layering different colors of sounds one by one, making music like a painter.Discover Americataught me how music in America has been greatly enhanced by its hybrid culture, taking cues from Caribbean or Creole music, for example.\u201d\nThat hybrid culture is a crucial component to Paraiso, and to the polyglot sounds that form to create new musical energy. YMO, for example, were big fans of the exotica sounds being made by Martin Denny, even his reductive \u201coriental\u201d records of the time. Hosono explained this to Vinyl Me Please:\nIn the 1950s interesting music was being made all around the world, Japan included. It was an era when all the great music [styles] were influencing each other. In Japan there was a strong mambo influence, even inventing a new rhythm called \u201cDodompa.\u201d New Orleans musicians were influenced by songs like Ray Charles\u2019 \u201cWhat I\u2019d Say,\u201d and were incorporating new sounds into their homegrown styles. Where music is born is always unintentional, pleasure seeking, plain and simple, and there\u2019s never any difficulties.\nOn Monday during our (now twice) weekly Dedicated Listening Sessions at ISC NYC, we\u2019ll be celebrating the world of Yellow Magic Orchestra through the below group and solo albums:\nHaruomi Hosono \u2013 Hosono HouseHaruomi Hosono \u2013 ParaisoHaruomi Hosono \u2013 NDEYukohiro Takahashi \u2013 SaravahYukihiro Takahashi \u2013 NeuromanticRyuichi Sakamoto \u2013 Left Handed DreamYellow Magic Orchestra \u2013 Yellow Magic OrchestraYellow Magic Orchestra \u2013 BGM\nOne passing mention in that LITA interview warrants further exploration. Told by interviewer Yuji Tanaka thatParaisosounds inspired by the jazz supergroup Weather Report, Hosono replied, \u201cIt was fusion. [The band] Stuff had a big influence, as well.\u201d Stuff was an instrumental fusion band featuring ace session musicians including drummer Steve Gadd and guitarists Eric Gale and Cornell Dupree.\nUnknown to many \u2014 and dirt cheap used \u2014 Stuff\u2019s self-titled 1976 album is dense with that Hosono sound.\nHere are the credits forParaiso, included because each musician on this list is worthy of research and extended listening dives.\nHaruomi Hosono\u2013 Bass, Vocals, Steelpan, Marimba, Percussion, Synthesizer (Roland, Yamaha CP-30), Electric piano, Gong, Whistle, Electric guitar, Performer (Birds, Foot Steps), ProductionShigeru Suzuki and Hirofumi Tokutake\u2013 Electric Guitar (Suzuki on \u201cShimend\u014dka\u201d and \u201cAsatoya Yunta\u201d; Tokutake on \u201cFemme Fatale\u201d)Tatsuo Hayashi and Yukihiro Takahashi\u2013 Drums (Hayashi on \u201cTokio Rush\u201d, \u201cShimend\u014dka\u201d, \u201cJapanese Rhumba\u201d, \u201cAsatoya Yunta\u201d, \u201cWorry Beads\u201d and \u201cParaiso\u201d; Takahashi on \u201cFemme Fatale\u201d)Hiroshi Sat\u014d and Ryuichi Sakamoto\u2013 Synthesizer (Yamaha Polyphonic, Yamaha CS-80, ARP Odyssey, Rhodes Performer), Piano (both on \u201cTokio Rush\u201d and \u201cParaiso\u201d; Sat\u014d on \u201cShimend\u014dka\u201d, \u201cJapanese Rhumba\u201d, \u201cAsatoya Yunta\u201d and \u201cWorry Beads\u201d; Sakamoto on \u201cFemme Fatale\u201d)Motoya Hamaguchi and Nobu Sait\u014d\u2013 Percussion (Hamaguchi on \u201cAsatoya Yunta\u201d and \u201cFemme Fatale\u201d; Sait\u014d on \u201cTokio Rush\u201d, \u201cShimend\u014dka\u201d, \u201cJapanese Rhumba\u201d, \u201cWorry Beads\u201d and \u201cParaiso\u201d)Masahiro Takekawa\u2013 Violin on \u201cWorry Beads\u201dTeave Kamayatsu\u2013 Vocals on \u201cJapanese Rhumba\u201dTaeko \u014cnuki\u2013 Backing Vocals/Choir on \u201cTokio Rush\u201d and \u201cWorry Beads\u201dTokyo Shyness Boys\u2013 Backing Vocals/Choir on \u201cTokio Rush\u201d and \u201cJapanese Rhumba\u201dHiroshi Kamayatsu\u2013 Backing Vocals/Choir on \u201cJapanese Rhumba\u201dTomako Kawada\u2013 Backing Vocals/Choir on \u201cJapanese Rhumba\u201d and \u201cAsatoya Yunta\u201d"

        "title": "A Glossary of Essential Hi-Fi Audio Terms from Altec Lansing",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/altec-lansing-audio-terms/",
        "content": "Looking to get deeper into hi-fi, but not sure where to start? Plenty of resources and articles are available online, but they can be difficult to read and often filled with terms that don\u2019t really mean anything when you\u2019re just starting out. Luckily, there are some great resources available from the past geared towards consumers. Back in the golden era of hi-fi in the \u201970s, hi-fi audio manufacturers made it a point to provide all the proper education and resources for their customers. Often released in pamphlets or reference manuals, these guides allowed customers not only better setup their speakers system within their homes, but also understand all the nuances between the company\u2019s products. Klipsch\u2019s cult favoriteDope from Hopeaudio newsletters are one classic example.\nIncluded in Altec Lansing\u2019s 1974 manual titledLoudspeaker Enclosures: Their Design and Use, the following glossary of hi-fi audio terms is essential for any beginner looking to dive in deeper and step up their audio game. For those looking to get into speaker building, check out the full manual available at Lansing Heritage:https://www.lansingheritage.org/html/altec/plans/1974-enc-manual.htm\nA-B Test\u2013 Evaluating the relative performance of two (or more) components or systems by switching quickly from one to the other. In comparing, the sudden contrast can reveal audible differences between the units. The fair method of comparison is with no change in the midband volume level. Due to efficiency differences between speaker systems, a method for compensating sensitivity. differences should be used.\nAcoustic Feedback\u2013 An annoying interference created when sound vibrations from the speaker system cause a vibration in the record player. The phono stylus can pick up these vibrations, which will be reproduced in the speaker system as a rumble or howl. The cure is to properly isolate the record player from the low frequencies of the speaker system.\nAmbience\u2013 A term referencing a condition of room acoustic characteristics. The total of all sound conditions, but generally excluding the direct sound from the per- former or reproducer. Primarily the reflected sound condition, including decay time and frequency emphasis. A condition that might be natural in a hall, or simulated in the record manufacturing process to create a specific hall image.\nAmplifier\u2013 An electronic device for magnifying, and usually controlling, the electrical signals sent to the speaker system. High fidelity amplifying equipment consists of a preamplifier/equalizer section plus a power/ basic amplifier section. In integrated amplifiers, both sections are built on one chassis and made available as a single unit. A receiver adds the tuner section to the integrated amplifier.\nBaffle\u2013 A term applied to many areas of a loudspeaker enclosure. Most generally applied to the enclosure itself, but also widely recognized as the loudspeaker mounting board. In horn, and other complex enclosures, the term is applied to individual boards within the enclosure that shape or change the air flow from the transducer. As baffle can be used in all applications, one has to interpret the writer\u2019s intention as to true meaning.\nBalance\u2013 A ratio term referring to the relative loudness or amplitude between sound sources. The control sections of stereo and quadraphonic amplifiers have balance controls to allow adjustments between speaker systems that have different pressure sensitivity. The term also applies to frequency response balance. For instance most speaker systems have a balance control in the crossover network to allow adjustment of the volume balance between the transducers in the system.\nBass Boom\u2013 An effect created by unwanted bass resonances in the sound reproduction. These resonances can be created by many various sources: improperly designed enclosure, cabinet panels not sufficiently braced, or incorrect enclosure size matching to a particular transducer. This publication should solve these problems. An additional source can be standing waves created in the room acoustics. See Standing Waves.\nCompliance\u2013 In loudspeaker language, the term refers to loudspeaker\u2019s mechanical suspension-and the suspension\u2019s ability to yield to the electrical force applied through the loudspeaker circuit. It is the ratio of cone/ diaphragm displacement to a force applied-the inverse of stiffness. A high compliance cone assembly moves easily, and is relatively freely suspended in the loudspeaker frame.\nCompression/Rarefaction\u2013 A dictionary would define compression as \u201csqueezing together\u201d or \u201cmaking smaller by pressure\u201d. In loudspeaker terms we can use the term two ways. As a loudspeaker cone moves forward, the cone applies pressure to the air adjacent to the cone. As this air is compressed by the pressure, it reacts by moving, in a wave form, in a direction away from the pressure. The effect of minus pressure at the rear of the cone, which causes adjacent air to \u201crush in\u201d and fill the gap of the vacuum created, is called rarefaction. The further use of the term compression relates to certain high frequency transducers. Here the sound waves of the diaphragm are squeezed in a narrow horn throat. The increased pressure and better air coupling offered by a horn, increases efficiency and sound levels-still maintaining low diaphragm travel motion.\nCone/Diaphragm\u2013 At Altec, we generally use the terms loudspeaker cone or loudspeaker diaphragm interchangeably. It has been used by some companies with cone referencing low frequency transducers, and diaphragm for high frequency units. It is the part which acts as the moving piston in the loudspeaker. The cone or diaphragm is suspended or held in the loudspeaker frame, and moves in relation to the varying source of electrical signal applied to the loudspeaker circuit. A cone or diaphragm assembly, as referenced to a dynamic speaker, would include the surround, which supports and holds the cone to the outer frame, the voice coil, which is wire wound onto a support and completes the loudspeaker circuit with the magnetic gap, and the spider, which helps center the voice coil in the gap and attaches the cone to the inner frame support.\nCrossover Network\u2013 The crossover network is used in a speaker system to divide the signal waveform into frequency bands to feed the appropriate loudspeaker transducer-high frequencies to the tweeter and low frequencies to the woofer. In three-way and four-way systems, more complex networks are required to separate the signal, by frequency, for each particular transducer to reproduce.\nDamping\u2013 As damping is applied to a loudspeaker, it expresses the ability of the cone/diaphragm to stop its motion as the electrical input signal ceases. Poor damping allows motion to continue briefly as an automobile with poor shock absorbers. This hangover creates a \u201cblooming\u201d sound to the bass frequencies, and masks clarity. Ampli- fiers also have a damping factor which helps control speaker motion. This effect is sometimes highly debated, but the benefits of an amplifier damping factor greater than 30 may be more theory than reality.\nDecibel\u2013 The decibel is a standard unit of measuring amplitude. Usually abbreviated as \u201cdB\u201d, the standard is a relative term-rather than an absolute. It is used to compare two different levels, such as voltage, current, or sound pressure level.\nDiaphragm\u2013 See Cone/Diaphragm.\nDistortion\u2013 In referencing playback, any change that the playback system imparts to the source or input sound would be classified as distortion. Distortion can exist at any link in the reproducing chain, and all subsequent links will reproduce the distortion created by an earlier link. Distortion exists in two principal forms \u2013 harmonic distortion and intermodulation distortion. Harmonic distortion references the distortion created on the multiple frequencies of a given fundamental frequency. Intermodulation distortion references the interaction of various frequencies, and any distortion created from the interaction. To the ear, IM or intermodulation distortion is generally the most offensive.\nEfficiency\u2013 Efficiency is a term used in discussing loudspeaker output relative to amplifier power input. Efficiency would generally denote a percentage, i.e., 20 percent, 10 percent, or .5 percent efficient. As a 10 percent efficient loudspeaker is high in efficiency, the percentage rating can be misleading. Today\u2019s specifications have a trend towards SPL or sound pressure level. This would reference a given dB of loudness, for a given wattage input, at a given distance from the speaker system. In comparing systems or loudspeakers on this basis, 3 dB difference requires half or twice the power-and 10 dB change requires one tenth or ten times the power for a given stand- ard of input sensitivity measurements.\nEnclosure\u2013 In loudspeaker terms we refer to the enclosure as the acoustically designed housing for the loudspeaker.\nEqualization\u2013 A deliberate, introduced change in frequency response would be called equalization. There are many forms of equalization; as used in disc recording and playback, tape recording and playback, graphic tone balance, room equalization, and speaker equalization. As the term implies, everything comes out \u201cequal\u201d in the end with flat overall response between microphone input and loudspeaker output.\nExcursion\u2013 The actual movement of the cone/diaphragm assembly is referred to as excursion. The allowable cone travel, or excursion, is a factor that is important to high power applications. Linear cone travel is necessary for low distortion.\nFidelity\u2013 The degree of faithfulness to the original accuracy and honesty in sound reproduction. See Distortion.\nFrequency\u2013 The rate of repetition in Hertz of musical pitch, as well as that of electrical signals. Hertz, as previously termed cycles-per-second, tells us how many repetitions exist per second of time in a given signal. Low frequencies refer to bass tones, and high frequencies to treble tones.\nFrequency Response\u2013 The ability of a component to reproduce a range of frequencies is called frequency response. How evenly the component responds to various frequencies within the range describes how \u201cflat\u201d that response would be. In loudspeaker and speaker systems, the quotation of a response range or flatness can be very misleading. The environment in which the measurement takes place can have so many variables, and does not necessarily relate to performance in the listening room, that meaningful specifications relating to frequency response are not currently available for loudspeakers or systems.\nHertz\u2013 See Frequency.\nImpedance\u2013 An engineering term which describes the degree to which a circuit impedes the flow of an alternating current. See text for fuller explanation as applies to loudspeakers.\nLoudness Compensation\u2013 The human ear experiences a loss in sensitivity, particularly in the bass frequencies, and somewhat in the high frequencies, at low volume levels. Loudness compensation corrects this by increasing the bass frequencies and highs in the correct proportions as the volume is decreased from a concert level.\nLoudspeaker/Transducer\u2013 The terms Altec uses to describe the unmounted loudspeaker. Also referred to as a \u201craw frame\u201d loudspeaker, and designates without an enclosure.\nPhase\u2013 Refers to any part of a sound wave or an electrical signal with respect to its passage in time. Two devices are in-phase when they furnish the signal or sound simultaneously. They are out-of-phase to the extent that, at a point in time, one lags or leads the other. In two-way and three-way speaker systems, it might be necessary, as a part of design, to create an out-of-phase electrical condition in order to create an in-phase acoustical condition.\nPower\u2013 Power is the electrical energy developed to do work, such as the power from an amplifier used to drive a speaker system. Also, acoustical energy or sound pressure developed in a room by a speaker system.\nPressure Sensitivity\u2013 The specification of pressure sensitivity relates to the sound pressure level from loudspeaker output, relative to a given electrical power input. See also Efficiency.\nResonance\u2013 Resonance refers to the tendency of any physical body to vibrate most freely at one particular frequency. In audio, the electrical and mechanical resonances of the various components must be controlled so that they do not affect the tonal quality of the music being reproduced. Also see text concerning impedance and resonance.\nRoom Acoustics\u2013 The natural acoustics of the listening room play a large part in determining the overall sound of the system. Altec encourages your experimentation in various speaker placements to determine what sounds best in your room. In general, attempt to have opposite surfaces of opposite textures-such as hard and absorbent. Also see further information under Standing Waves.\nRumble\u2013 As its name suggests, rumble is a low frequency rumbling noise produced by poorly built turntables or record changers. Because of the low frequencies of rumble, it can often be confused with acoustic feedback. Proper speaker system placement requires a good under- standing of both acoustic feedback and rumble.\nSpider\u2013 The spider is the name of the mechanical collar, located at the neck of the cone/diaphragm, which fastens the cone to the inner portion of the loudspeaker frame and helps keep the voice coil centered in the magnetic gap.\nStanding Waves\u2013 As the sound or music is reproduced from the speaker systems, the wave fronts move forward through the listening room, hit the opposite wall, and are then reflected back into the listening area. Depending on the ceiling height, room width and length, these waves can create an in-phase or out-of-phase condition which is detrimental to reproduction. Most frequent problems in the average room occur with an in-phase condition at 80 and 200 Hz. The goal is to eliminate these standing waves by experimenting with various speaker placements.\nSurround\u2013 The surround is the mechanical collar which fastens the outer edge of the cone/diaphragm to rim of the loudspeaker basket. Various materials are used to achieve the degree of compliance desired.\nWatts\u2013 The watt is a unit of electrical or acoustical power. The term designates the power consumed in an electrical device. In audio we specify not the power to keep the amplifier running, but rather the amount of audio power the amplifier is capable of delivering to the speaker sys- tem. Because the loudspeaker is not a particularly efficient device, the acoustic output power from the loudspeaker, in watts, is far less than the amplifier audio power input."

        "content": "In the mid-1970s, Palo Alto and vicinity was becoming a home computing hub. In Cupertino, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak had partnered to begin building the first Apple computers and aligned themselves with kindred spirits as part of the Homebrew Computer Club.\nTen miles away, Stanford University was drawing thousands of young, creative innovators eager to forge something new, both technologically and culturally speaking. One of them was a guitarist uninterested in rock and the oversaturated youth marketplace; he was focused on delicate solo guitar music.\nBorn as a vehicle to get label founder Will Ackerman\u2019s albumSearch For the Turtle\u2019s Navelinto record stores, Ackerman and then-wife Anne Robinson, gradually built Windham Hill (named for Ackerman\u2019s favorite Vermont inn) to become an independent powerhouse. As the label grew, they added local compadres including Michael Hedges and George Winston.\nWhether the simultaneous rise of Apple and Windham Hill was an accident of history or the product of a cultural stew unique to the region is for PhD candidates to argue. But it\u2019s certainly notable that the birth of New Age music and the creation of a machine that helped launch a new age occurred at the same time and place.\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t driven by singles. We weren\u2019t driven by radio,\u201d recalled early Windham Hill operative Jeff Heiman. \u201cWe were driven by, \u2018Let\u2019s try and find as many ways as possible to tell people about this music.\u2019\u201d One way they accomplished this: Concerts and live broadcasts like the one below.\nBy the mid-1980s, the label had built a mini-empire with a singular sound, eventually signing a distribution deal with major label A&M Records. They released hundred of albums. Though Ackerman hated the term, new age sections started appearing in record stores, populated by artists including Suzanne Ciani, David Lanz, Kitaro, Iasos, Liz Story, Laraaji, Joanna Brouk and more.\n\u201cWindham Hill created its own bin,\u201d artist manager Jeanne Rizzo (George Winston) told thePalo Alto Times. The label also successfully infiltrated health food shops and metaphysical book stores.\nDespite doing big numbers, taste making media outlets such asRolling Stone,CreemandThe New York Timeseither dismissed the music or ignored it altogether.\n\u201cMuch of this music is \u2014 now\u2019s the time to say it \u2014 more boring than silence,\u201d wrote critic Kelefa Sanneh in 2005, calling Windham Hill \u201cthe world\u2019s most unshocking record company.\u201dThe Los Angeles Timesdescribed their output as \u201cYuppie Elevator Music.\u201d Others called it hot tub music.\nSuch dismissiveness didn\u2019t affect the demand for records from Windham Hill, Milwaukee powerhouse Narada, or the Tangerine Dream-connected label Private Music. But the vocal hate for the music certainly rubbed off on a younger generation curious about gentler, more subtle sounds but afraid to be caught dead with a Windham Hill release in their collection.\nThe 2013 compI Am the Center: Private Issue New Age Music In America 1950-1990was the first of many historical correctives that reopened the conversation on New Age and NA-adjacent music. By definition, that collection didn\u2019t include more established labels like Windham Hill, though. That means that a bounty of music remains easy to find for collectors; Narada, Private, and WH records are a dime a dozen because they sold so many copies back in the day.\nA few years back, ISC NYC\u2019s Dane Majors offered ten crucial Windham Hill records to track down. It\u2019s a revelatory list."

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/krautrocksampler/",
        "content": "InKrautrocksampler, his great book about German cosmic music, the musician, collector and writer Julian Cope describes the sensation of being a fan of Can, Neu!, Cluster, Amon D\u00fc\u00fcl and other bands as their records were originally being released: \u201cAlbums were impossible to judge as they came out because they defied analysis alongside anything else but other Krautrock.\u201d\nPublished in 1995 for the tiny British imprint Head Heritage,Krautrocksampler: One Head\u2019s Guide to the Great Kosmische Music \u2013 1968 Onwardshelped corral a bunch of amazing music that had seldom before been gathered and analyzed as a whole. Despite the bounty of information and scholarship on the music now filling shelves and servers, the book was an epiphany in \u201995, connecting so many dots and revealing so many must-haves that its publication helped cause a gold rush as fans began searching bins for records \u2014 many of them cutouts \u2014 by bands Cope touts within.\n\u201cWhen I decided to write this Krautrocksampler in September 1994 (CE),\u201d Cope writes in his introduction, \u201cit was surprising but not bewildering to discover that here was one of thee Great Untold Visionary Stories. I read of those beautiful German post-war artists and I cried my heart out. If I had been a young German in the 1960s I would have played Krautrock or died.\u201d\nWrites Cope of his endeavor:\nThis little history attempts to explain the reasons, but it can never truly explain the music of a whole youth-nation working out their blues. There was a fire burning in the souls of post-war German youth that somehow needed to be, not fanned, not put out, nor added to with petrol \u2013 but rather that fire needed to be allowed to burn. And burn it did. With an intensity that could have changed the very fabric of the West had it taken place in Britain or the USA. But that was not the nature of the fire, so it was never to be. Instead, we are left with he legacy of the daring German Youth-dance away from their recent past.\nKrautrock is it \u2013 some of the most astonishing, evocative, heroic glimpses of Man at his Peak of Artistic Magic\nThe timing of its publication is notable. In the mid-1990s, a number of young bands were discovering and drawing inspiration from Kosmische Musik. Bands including Stereolab, Broadcast, Spacemen 3, Buffalo Daughter and Stereo Total were tapping ideas forged by Neu!, Can, and Harmonia to create new work. Stereolab, in fact, ripped entire riffs and melodies from their inspirations.\nCope drew his information from his vast collection of Krautrock records. He shot photos of the album covers, transcribed liner notes and credits, made connections between various musical philosophies and influences.\nWriting about Karlheinz Stockhausen\u2019s influence on young musicians, Cope described the composer\u2019s experience of lecturing at UC-Berkeley in the late 1960s, \u201cwhere he had lectured on experimental music. Among those at his seminars were the Grateful Dead\u2019s Jerry Garcia and Phil Lesh, Grace Slick of Jefferson Airplane, and many other psychedelic musicians. Far from snubbing the new music, Stockhausen was seen at a Jefferson Airplane show at the Fillmore West and was quoted as saying that the music \u201c\u2026 really blows my mind \u201d\nCope\u2019s writing on Can is fantastic, especially his rundown of the band\u2019s origin story:\nSince 1965, two students of Stockhausen, Holger Czukay and Irmin Schmidt, had talked of forming a group together, a group that would both utilise and transcend ethnic, electronic experimental, and modern classical music. But now it was 1967 and Czukay was a music teacher. One of his students, Michael Karoli, had recently blown Czukay\u2019s mind by playing him the Beatles\u2019 \u201cI Am the Walrus.\u201d And it was soon after this, whilst listening to Jimi Hendrix, The Mothers of Invention and the Velvet Underground\u2019s Banana LP one night, that Irmin Schmidt and Holger Czukay finally decided to take the plunge and include rock\u2019n\u2019roll elements in their group. Like Kraftwerk later, they were from an extremely academic background, and were uncomfortable yet fascinated by every aspect of rock \u2019n roll. But it was rock \u2019n roll\u2019s sense of moment that thrilled them most of all.\nNeedless to say, their own thrills bore so many subsequent thrills that more than 50 years later Can has been cited as influences by nearly as many bands as the Beatles.\nThough out of print,Krautrocksampleris availableto read digitallyat Archive.org. Cope offers a crucial list of his favorite records and delivers overviews of labels including Ohr, Brain and Sky. It\u2019s a feast that will inevitably send you in search of new records.\nThose in the New York area can hear eight essential Krautrock records during our weekly Monday dedicated listening session.

        "content": "By the mid-1970s, Herbie Hancock had left bop and post-bop behind as he grew increasingly fascinated with electric keyboards and early synthesizers. Long a genre-straddling innovator, Hancock embraced instrumental funk and rhythm-powered experimental avenues on his 1975 albumMan-Childand, a year later,Secrets. With a secure, fruitful relationship with Columbia Records, Hancock set about changing the sound and vibe of jazz.\nHe\u2019d also built a stellar band:\nHerbie Hancock \u2013 keyboardsMelvin \u201cWah Wah Watson\u201d Ragin \u2013 guitarBennie Maupin \u2013 saxophone, woodwindsPaul Jackson \u2013 bassJames Levi \u2013 drums\nIn a 1976 interview, Hancock explained that \u201cother things that make the character of this music different than other directions I\u2019ve been involved with in the past is the fact that I\u2019ve got a bunch of keyboards around me when I\u2019m performing this music.\u201d\nAdding that drummer Tony Williams turned him onto synthesizers, Hancock said that \u201cin a way, it was sort of a natural evolution for me because not only have I always been interested in sound and its possibilities, but I\u2019ve got this streak in me that that likes electronics. This is a carryover from when I wanted to be an engineer. I love gadgets and I love buttons. And I got plenty of gadgets and plenty of buttons around me. And they really helped me to make the kind of music that I want to make.\u201d\nThis is all evident in the 40-minute broadcast. Of particular note: Hancock introduces \u201cGentle Thoughts\u201d as \u201ca song written by Wah Wah Watson that tells us what happens in the minds of gentle people.\u201d The band then rips through a jazz-funk ripper that, to these ears, peaks at Maupin\u2019s glorious sax solo and the move to Hancock\u2019s solo, all guided by Watson\u2019s remarkable wah-wah strum tone. Their set:\n\u201cHang Up Your Hang Ups\u201d (fromMan-Child, 1975)\u201cGentle Thoughts\u201d (fromSecrets, 1976)\u201cSpider\u201d (fromSecrets)"

We appreciate you attending our events, record fairs, pop-ups, listening sessions, and casual hangs. Thanks for dancing at our parties. Thanks for listening silently, and with intention. If you\u2019re reading this, know that we don\u2019t take your time and attention for granted.\nWe\u2019ve got brilliant things in store for 2024, and we can\u2019t wait to share them with you.\nIn the short term, here\u2019s something simple: A bunch of cassette mixtapes from the 1990s (ok one\u2019s from 2000). Created when tape demos were the primary means of making waves in the rave and club scenes, booking gigs, and earning attention, the mixes were hand-built using rudimentary technology and often designed to display beat-matching skills, a crucial way to convey curatorial expertise and deliver the goods. Some, like the great Andrew Weatherall\u2019s mixtape from Cream below, were recorded at parties, the truth of which conjures images of kindred spirits lost in dance floor bliss.\nOne of the great events of the British rave scene, Cream originated in 1992 and expanded to become Creamfields a few years later. The brilliant Weatherall (Two Lone Swordsman, Sabres of Paradise) delivered acid and proto-techno thrills during this mix.\nIn mid-1990s NYC, producers inspired by a stew of house, hip hop, jungle, Latin funk, dub, and ambient combined to create a deep subgenre known as illbient. Alongside DJ Spooky and DJ Wally, the label-head, producer, and DJ Soul Slinger was among the deepest. This mix from 1994 maneuvers through various tones and texture, emphasizing heavy bass at every turn.\nBorn Ferenc E. van der Sluijs, the artist known as I-F stormed onto the electro scene with the epic party anthem \u201cSpace Invaders are Smoking Grass,\u201d and has been crafting magnetic techno bangers for more than 30 years. Originally issued as a CD mix, this wild 2000 amalgamation draws from the entire history of electro.\nDetroit. Jeff Mills. Speed. Second wave techno. Make sure to drink a lot of water on the dance floor.\nThose of us who experienced first-hand the ways in which Paul Johnson built sets and worked crowds knew that on a good night he was the best house DJ on Earth. A master on the mixing board who could lock beats with a few finger flips and worked the pitch-control to speed up a cappella voices with glee, the legendary Chicago producer-DJ was a staple at Midwest raves in the 1990s \u2014 I saw him in an abandoned St. Louis warehouse space back in the day \u2014 and could move dancers like no other. This mixtape is frickin\u2019 wild."

What\u2019s the best sounding pressing of this album? Rarely do we think about the worst version\u2026 In 1970, British avant-garde composer Gavin Bryars formed the self-proclaimed \u201cworst orchestra in the world.\u201d Taking classical music out of the hands of the \u2018tuxedo-Nazis\u2019, the group explored how amateurism might produce more interesting results than the conventional and often trite attempts at musical perfection.\nInstead of picking the most competent musicians, the Portsmouth Sinfonia encouraged anyone to join, regardless of talent, ability or experience. The only rules were that everyone had to come for rehearsals and that people should try their best to get it right and not intentionally try to play badly. The Sinfonia quickly blossomed into an 82-member band comprised of students at the Portsmouth College of Arts alongside a young Brian Eno on clarinet (an instrument he had never played), composer Michael Nyman, and experimentalist Steve Beresford.\n\u201cI just fell in love with them. They had something rare and beautiful. They were uninhibited by the stuffy rules and all the things I hated about classical music.\u201d\nThe Portsmouth Sinfonia would go on to perform at venues ranging from avant-garde music festivals to the Royal Albert Hall. Their debut releasePlays The Popular Classicslanded in 1973 and included renditions of familiar favorites from The Nutcracker Suite, William Tell Overture, Gustav Holt\u2019s The Planets, and more. Promo copies of the vinyl fetch high prices these days and often include handwritten notes from radio station DJs like \u201cthis is the worst music I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d\nBrian Eno: \u201cMy own involvement in the Sinfonia is on two levels \u2013 I am a non-musician in the sense of never having \u201cstudied music\u201d, yet at the same time, I notice that many of the more significant contributions to rock music and, to a lesser extent, avant-garde music have been made by enthusiastic amateurs and dabblers. Their strength is that they are able to approach the task of music-making without previously acquired solutions and without a too firm concept of what is and what is not musically possible. Coupled with this, and consequent to it, is a current fascination with the role of \u2018the accident\u2019 in structured activities.\u201d\nListen to the group gloriously butcher Christmas classic \u201cDance Of The Sugar Plum Fairy.\u201d Thanks to Brendan from Folk Arts Rare Records for playing this at our Holiday Market the other week in San Diego <3"

Before it was rewritten as \u201cWhat Child Is This?\u201d in the 19th century and became a Christmas song, \u201cGreensleeves\u201d was called \u201cA Newe Northen Dittye of ye Ladye Greene Sleves.\u201d It was a breakup song written by a dude shunned by a woman referred to only as \u201cGreen Sleeves.\u201d How\u2019d her sleeves get green? Grass stains, the story goes, from her lying down with so many men. Despite her green-sleeved reputation, the narrator of the song has fallen hard for her. But she\u2019s not having any of it.\n\u201cAlas, my love, you do me wrong/To cast me off discourteously,\u201d he sings, seemingly heartbroken. In this interpretation, the shunned man\u2019s nickname for her, Green Sleeves, is a vindictive descriptive meant to besmirch. The Baby Jesus rewrite, by Thomas Chatterton Dix, was published in 1865. This version opens with, \u201cWhat child is this, who, laid to rest/On Mary\u2019s lap is sleeping?\u201d The difference is night and day: One\u2019s about a woman who\u2019s enjoyed a lot of sex and the other\u2019s about a woman who\u2019s never had any.\nArmed with this vital info, turn up the volume on a newly discovered Coltrane take on \u201cGreensleeves.\u201d Recorded with a single microphone at the Village Gate in New York in 1961, the 16-minute version came out this year via Impulse! after being discovered in the New York Public Library archives. One of the most important archival releases of the year,Evenings At The Village Gatefeatures Coltrane, woodwind genius Eric Dolphy, and a backing combo of pianist McCoy Tyner, bassist Reggie Workman, and drummer Elvin Jones.\nThat it\u2019s recorded with one microphone is notable. As Universal Music wrote in a blog post: \u201cThe recordings, uncovered at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, were made by engineer Rich Alderson as part of a test of the Village Gate\u2019s then-new sound system. The tapes seemed to have been lost, were found, but then disappeared again into Library\u2019s vast sound archives.\u201d Audiophiles might have issues with the single-mic recording \u2014 a few Coltrane solos are a little low in the mix \u2014 but it sounds fantastic to me. You can hear the room, and Jones\u2019 pounding drums have a deep resonance.\nThe discovery of the tape yielded the only recording of their Village Gate residency and features Coltrane moving through \u201cMy Favorite Things,\u201d \u201cImpressions,\u201d \u201cWhen Lights Are Low\u201d and the only known non-studio recording of Coltrane\u2019s \u201cAfrica.\u201d\nThose home for holidays and looking for a reason to pop on Coltrane during the family gathering would be advised to queue this up. Not only will it offer 16 minutes of communal bliss, you can stun them with your insight on the rendition."

        "content": "\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work in New York, we\u2019re in big f**king trouble,\u201d New York Dolls guitarist Sylvain Sylvain says in the fascinating BBC 4 documentaryOnce Upon a Time in New York, about the creativity generated in a mid-1970s Lower Manhattan realm that Lenny Kaye calls \u201cfar from the glitz of Times Square.\u201d\nThe doc dives into the cultural stew that across five shocking years became the birthplace of punk, disco and rap. It\u2019s worth an hour of your time.\n\u201cWith California taking center stage, New York felt like an abandoned city,\u201d the detached narrator says of the period, when the city was on the verge of bankruptcy, entire blocks were dense with boarded buildings and much of lower New York was an open-air heroin bazaar.\nChris Stein of Blondie recalls being able to buy cocaine in \u201cat least ten different little stores\u201d near his flat. The Velvet Underground\u2019s John Cale says that so much space was empty in the area that City Hall offered dirt cheap housing to anyone who presented a painting and declared themselves a working artist.\nOnce Upon a Time in New Yorknotes the many historic connections that gave rise to the music \u2014 and to club culture in general. The Stonewall Riots, for example, emboldened the LGBTQ community to protest on and off the dance floor; prior to the era-defining event, cops would regularly enforce a law that forbid same-sex couples from dancing together. The weekend-long uprising caused New York mayor John Lindsay change the law, which propelled a revolution that begat disco. \u201cIt gave everybody free reign to open someplace to dance for gay people,\u201d says DJ Nicky Siano.\nThat allowed for people like David Mancuso to transform his loft space into a dance Mecca. Mancuso, a student of Timothy Leary, notes of the Loft\u2019s birth: \u201cCertainly LSD had a role in it. But not entirely.\u201d\nSiano explains his aim when he built loft space the Gallery: \u201cWe created and designed a space within this empty loft space \u2014 within this blank canvas \u2014 we created an environment specifically geared towards dancing and blowing your mind.\u201d The story later moves to explore the legacy of Studio 54, with Public Enemy\u2019s Chuck D describing the disdain that Black New Yorkers had for the star-studded, mostly segregated (unless you were famous), notably classist version of the Garage.\nOnce Upon a Time in New Yorkseamlessly presents the rise of rap, disco and punk as part of continuum, with each culture informing, reacting to (or against), and absorbing messes of rhythms, textures, and approaches of the others. In that sense, it\u2019s a great companion toLove Goes to Buildings on Fire, writer Will Hermes\u2019 definitive account of New York in the mid- and late-1970s.\n\u2026 amid the skyscrapers we marveled at from the Thirteen-Story Building, down on the streets, artists were breaking music apart and rebuilding it for a new era. Kool Herc, Afrika Bambaataa, and Grandmaster Flash hot-wired street parties with collaged shards of vinyl LPs. The New York Dolls stripped rock \u2018n\u2019 roll to its frame and wrapped it in gender-fuck drag, taking a cue from Warhol\u2019s transvestite glamour queens. Bruce Springsteen and Patti Smith, both bussed in from Jersey, took a cue from the elusive Dylan, combining rock and poetry into new shapes.\nHermes continues:\nDowntown, David Mancuso and Nicky Siano were inventing the modern disco and the art of club mixing. Uptown, Eddie Palmieri, Willie Col\u00f3n, and the Fania All-Stars were hot-rodding Cuban music into multiculti salsa, making East Harlem and the South Bronx the global center of forward-looking Spanish-language music. In the wake of Miles Davis\u2019s funk fusions, jazz players were setting up shop in lofts and other repurposed spaces, exploding the music in all directions, synthesizing free-jazz passion with all that came before and after. Just blocks away Philip Glass and Steve Reich were imagining a new sort of classical music, pulling an end run on European tradition using jazz, rock, African and Indian sources, and some New York hustle.\nDivided into 20-minute suites, theOnce Upon a Time in New Yorkdocumentary moves from disco\u2019s birth to punk\u2019s, interviewing the New York Dolls\u2019 David Johansen and Sylvain Sylvain, Richard Hell, Lenny Kaye, and other figureheads. It also features thrilling footage of pre-fame Deborah Harry and Blondie ripping through a cover of Martha and the Vandellas\u2019 \u201cHeat Wave\u201d at CBGB. Also worth it: Talking Heads drummer Chris Franz telling the story of asking CBGBs owner Hilly Kristol for an audition. His response, according to Franz: \u201cWell, I could put you on in front of the Ramones tomorrow night.\u201d\nMoving to the Bronx and the rise of rap,Once Upon a Time \u2026features typically thoughtful analysis from Fab Five Freddy, present-at-the-creation recollections from DJ Kool Herc, Chuck D, writer Nelson George, Grandmaster Flash, and others.\nBlondie\u2019s visit uptown to a late 1970s hip hop party is one focus. Told by Grandmaster Flash, the story involves Deborah Harry and Fab Five Freddy approaching Flash, who was DJing. She told him that she was going to make a song about him. He dismissed the comment. That song, \u201cRapture,\u201d became the first No. 1 record to include a rapped verse, what Freddy calls \u201cprobably the first time most people heard this idea of rapping.\u201d\nSaid Blondie\u2019s Chris Stein near the end of the documentary, \u201cOne of the guys from Wu-Tang told me it was the first rap he ever heard \u2014 so that\u2019s kind of a mind-f*ck.\u201d\nWatch it here.\nAnd a shout-out to Todd Burns at Music Journalism Insiderfor the tip on this.

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/nancy-sinatra-lee-hazlewood/",
        "content": "There are records that are as potent as psychedelics. Records that whoosh you into another realm the moment the stylus locks into the groove, embrace you in their ever-loving melodies and rhythms, present dilemmas and ideas, convey hidden messages and sonic delights that you and you alone understand.\nNancy & Leeis one of them, and an essential psychedelic country pop record in our In Sheep\u2019s Clothing NYC collection. As a way to illustrate the breadth of the holdings at our recently opened spot connected to Port Sa\u2019id, we\u2019re highlighting sounds you might hear (at proper volume, as always) when coming by for an afternoon or evening respite. Close your eyes. It\u2019s 1968. Imagine yourself in an oasis, one with perfect sound. \u201cSome Velvet Morning\u201d comes on the system. Hazlewood has Phaedra on his mind. Sinatra is thinking about flowers.\n\u201cI wanted it to go into the waltz. I had some personal problems with people telling me, \u2018I really like the song you wrote Lee, you can really dance to it,'\u201d Hazlewood said of the songin a 2011 interviewwith the Arts Desk\u2019s Kieron Tyler. \u201cI don\u2019t like people dancing to my music. I was being very contrary. The next thing I sat down to write happened to be that song and I go, dance to this sons of bitches.\u201d\nHe continued:\nPhaedra is of course a Greek goddess, and she had a sad ending and beginning. She became the most interesting to me in the little mythology thing I like to do. What started it to me was, every night I read to my children the Greek mythology stories \u2013 I thought they were a lot better than all those fairy tales that came from Germany that had killings and knifings. So that\u2019s where my interest was, and there was only about seven lines about Phaedra \u2013 she had a sad middle, a sad end, and by the time she was 17 she was gone, she was a sad-assed broad. So bless her heart, she deserves some notoriety, so I\u2019ll put her in a song. The meaning is that she\u2019s the saddest of all Greek goddesses, so little is known about her except that she was so miserable, but what a great lady.\n\u201cWe used to call it beauty and the beast!,\u201d Sinatra told Light in the Attic, which last year reissued the record, of her and Hazlewood\u2019s years-long collaboration, the majority of which was released under Sinatra\u2019s name alone. For their two collaborative records, both let their freak-flags fly.\nThey were abetted by a team of session musicians who injected expert life into each track. They included David Briggs (who went on to produce a string of great Neil Young albums, including Tonight\u2019s the Night), bassist Carole Kaye, guitarist Glen Campbell and drummer Hal Blaine. Check out Blaine\u2019s insane work on Nancy and Lee\u2019s cover of \u201cTired of Waiting for You\u201d by the Kinks. The track wasn\u2019t included on the original record, but its addition to Light in the Attic\u2019s reissue as a bonus track is a revelation.\nTold by Tyler that the Hazlewood-penned songs on Nancy & Lee, \u201cSand\u201d and \u201cSummer Wine,\u201d \u201chave that brooding atmosphere,\u201d Hazlewood replied, \u201cAren\u2019t they swell? \u2026 They\u2019re all covered up with all kinds of meanings. Everybody used to come up and go, \u2018What does this mean?\u2019 and I\u2019d go, \u2018What does this mean to you?\u2019 \u2018I think it\u2019s de de de,\u2019 and I say, \u2018You got it exactly right.\u2019 That way everybody gets a chance to know exactly what the song means \u2013 a sort of democracy for listeners. They\u2019d say \u2018in \u201cSome Velvet Morning\u201d does this mean\u2026?\u2019 and I\u2019d tell them, \u2018Damn, you got it right away.\u2019 \u2018Thank you. I was telling my wife that last night. I thought that meant that.\u2019 Having participated in this little bit of theatre they knew the meaning, and God knows \u2013 I maybe didn\u2019t.\u201d\nHazlewood spoke of the song\u2019s curious structure, which moves from waltz to 4:4 depending on who\u2019s singing.Speaking with Joe McGinty, Hazlewood was hilariously blunt:\nWhen I wrote it, I did it just for pure orneriness of the musicians, more than anything else. I said \u201cYou see the ending here, it goes 4/4 into 3/4. Don\u2019t worry about it because I can cut it together. We\u2019ll do all the 4/4, then we\u2019ll do the 3/4.\u201d Well, about half of them stood up very, very insulted. They really came down on me heavy \u2013 \u201cWho do you think we are?\u201d \u2013 and they were not happy. They just set up and played right through it. And I go, \u201cOkay, all right smartasses, then we\u2019ll do it your way.\u201d Which I thought might happen. I got a lot of good music by pushing guys and doing stuff like that.\nMcGinty: By challenging them?\nYeah, and I think some of them knew it, the ones that had been around me. Some of them really got a little bit insulted\u2014that I would suggest that I\u2019d have to cut together something as simple as that. But I\u2019d say, \u201cwell, you never know.\u201d\nIt was nice to know that you had the option.\nI knew I could cut it together, but I didn\u2019t think I was gonna have to."

The recollection was posted alongside the new video for the joyously saucy romp, which is an ode to making love to his then-wife Bedria Sanders:\nBedria was in the studio when Pharoah played \u2018Love Will Find a Way\u2019 for the first time and she remembers what it was like to realize that she was the inspiration:\n\u201cIt made me blush,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was just like\u2014spontaneous, from the heart, in the moment.\u201d\nThe memory was resurrected on Wednesday as part of the rollout to Luaka Bop\u2019s new Pharoah box, a brilliant package whose centerpiece is the woefully overlooked 1977 album.\nThe recently launchedHarvest Time Projecthas already delivered a fount of fascinating archival material that offers context to a period that found Sanders without his long-running label Impulse! Records.\nOne entry in the series captures events surrounded a 1977 gig in Copenhagen, Denmark.\nNiels Christiansen, today a music writer and respected figure in the Danish music scene, was 25 back then and had booked the show, and also ran sound on the night. He first met Pharoah and his band when they landed in Denmark. \u201cI remember that there was no eye-contact when I picked him up at the airport,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure what was going on, but thought maybe it was related to whatever his experience had been coming through customs at the airport. At the show, I remember thinking Pharoah was a different kind of person. He kept to himself. He didn\u2019t really acknowledge the fact that there was an audience, which I think surprised people. He walked around onstage without playing in the microphone.\u201d\nThe newspaper review below appeared in the Danish daily newspaper Politiken, notes the entry, which offers an excerpted quote from the piece.\n\u201cIt is the tone, its sonorous \u2013 and emotional expressive possibilities, that Sanders has succeeded not only in cultivating, but also in building on his Coltrane heritage with a deep personal commitment, that today he himself stands out as one of jazz\u2019s great individuals,\u201d the critic wrote."

        "content": "During an interview with the director Marcelo Machado, whose 2013 filmTropicaliadocuments the Brazilian tropicalia movement of the 1960s and \u201970s, he uses a phrase that captures the essence of the music. Describing its legacy as an inspiration to generations, he praises musicians including Gal Costa, Tom Ze, Caetano Veloso and Os Mutantes for \u201cnot being afraid toeat the foreigners and use their energyto build a better way of life.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cArt inhales us for life and after more then 40 years the tropicalists still do this. They are a source of inspiration for all of us.\u201d\nAnyone who can so eloquently convey the tropicalia spirit knows their stuff, andTropicalia, which just celebrated the 10th anniversary of its release, is an invaluable source of inspiration and information, both on the music and the explosive politics of the time.\nHere\u2019s Machado on the birth of tropicalia:\nThey were from the left, these kids, but the traditional left didn\u2019t agree with their ideas, and the right neither. They were a counter-cultural movement, against the situation, but not in the way the traditional left was doing. They were not pretending to be leaders of a Brazilian revolution, they were doing music and discussing Brazilian contradictions in this hard political environment, the beginning of the military dictatorship.\nThe movement wasn\u2019t limited to music. Visual artists, theatre troupes and dancers got involved, too. As these contributions multiplied, they grew into a powerful political force. Machado\u2019s film offers breathtaking images and scenes of this collision.\nThis was the first music that I gave attention to. When I was 10 years old they had this festival on TV [The TV Record Pop Music Festival in July 1967] so I watched Caetano Veloso sing \u201cAlegria, Alegria\u201d, Os Mutantes with Gilberto Gil [singing] \u201cDomingo No Parque\u201d. The first thing that I understand now is that I couldn\u2019t understand the lyrics. At the same time I was listening to The Beatles and Rolling Stones and I couldn\u2019t understand [them] either because it was in English.\u201d\nHere\u2019s that Gil/Mutantes performance.\nThose who have inhaled and/or eaten up the music of Brazil in the \u201960s will get a thrill out of this remarkable film, which is as artfully, thoughtfully crafted as the music it documents. For those who are just learning about the movement, this will deliver repeated epiphanies, and offer countless avenues for future exploration.\nWant to dig deeper.

Smith and the Fall opens the BBC 4\u2019s 2004 documentary of the Mancunian shit-disturber. A caller on John Peel\u2019s radio show is recalling a recent Fall gig as on camera we watch Smith and band prepare its 24th live performance on BBC\u2019s famed seriesThe Peel Sessions.\nBy the mid-2000s, the British post-punk band had been together for nearly three decades. Founder and (only consistent member) Smith had somehow turned his cranky, squawking voice into sharp musical instrument. As a bandleader, he had shepherded more than 50 musicians through the wringer, quickly alienating most of them and hiring new ones to take their places.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s me and your granny on bongos, then it\u2019s the Fall,\u201d Smith famously quipped of membership in the band.\nRather than petering out as the punk movement wore down, Smith and his hired hands got to work. Through the 1990s they released some of their best work, sounds that merged electronic tones and accents with guitar, big rhythms and That Voice. Smith started the decade, in fact, by collaborating with Coldcut, the influential sample-driven beat group founded by Matt Black and Jonathan More. Best known these days for launching the label Ninja Tune, Coldcut teamed with Smith to create dance punk jams that set the stage for the DFA Records scene of a decade later.\nBy 2004, Smith was a uniquely British icon who reveled in his notoriety, one enhanced by his love of booze and no bullshit approach to speaking his mind.\nAll of this and more are explored inThe Wonderful and Frightening World of Mark E. Smith. An allusion to one of the band\u2019s best albums, the documentary is an essential introduction to a creative spirit whose direct, insightful lyrics read as well on the page as they do being uttered."

        "content": "As one of the earliest artists on the essential 1990s label Astralwerks, Future Sound of London helped define ambient electronic music for a new generation. Crafting tripped-out psychedelia to enhance whatever hallucinogen was currently warping your reality, the work of Gaz Cobain and Brian Dougans produced sounds not for peak 2 a.m. revelry but for the 5 a.m. post-trip comedown.\nThe pair were present at the formation of British acid house, absorbing its spirit and energy and transforming it on the fly. Dougans\u2019 first-ever track, as Stakker Humanoid, is a frenzy of Roland rhythms and ref whistles.\nA few years later Dougans and Cobain converged to create more pensive tones that were no less prescient.\nTheir 13-minute video for \u201cLifeforms\u201d features computer graphics that, while rudimentary, were remarkably forward-thinking. At the time it was an illuminating, alien look at where computer animation was headed, a kind of free-floating flight through somebody else\u2019s imagination.\nBy 1996, Astralwerks had begun establishing itself as a tastemaking powerhouse, releasing 12-inches and albums by the Chemical Bros., Mike Paradinas\u2019 project \u00b5-Ziq, and intercontinental production team Skylab, among others. Simultaneously, MTV was trying to figure out the post-grunge 1990s, and eager to connect with the youth culture that was their demographic lifeblood. That same year the network premiered Amp, a three-hour block of contemporary electronic music. In retrospect, it was a visionary show, highlighting for American viewers artists including Daft Punk, Brian Eno, Autechre, Tricky and dozens more. Here\u2019s a clip of Amp that gives you sense of the show\u2019s spirit. Be sure to check out Ken Ishii\u2019s fantastic anime-inspired clip.\nThat first year, Amp devoted 20 minutes of one show to Future Sounds of London, which the production team filled with experimental videos by themselves, Gaz Cobain\u2019s ambient project Amorphous Androgynous and more. The clip is like a time capsule, offering a sense of the strange, surreal direction that electronic music was taking.\nA number of other Amp clips are floating around. Track them down; they\u2019re beautiful documents of a lesser-known moment in electronic music culture."

        "content": "The most beautiful and profound emotion we can experience is the sensation of the mystical. It is the sower of all true science. He to whom this emotion is a stranger, who can no longer wonder and stand rapt in awe, is good as dead.\u2013Albert Einstein\nThe above quote, which introduces Terry Riley\u2019s hour-long televised 1977 concert in the Netherlands, precisely captures the essence of not only the composer\u2019s mission but the aim of deep, focused listening in general. To experience the mystical is to allow music (or film, visual art, literature, etc.) to take full control of your psyche; all other thoughts and internal mutters be damned.\nRiley was in his early 40s when he took the stage. He\u2019d already earned worldwide acclaim for his pieces \u201cA Rainbow in Curved Air\u201d and \u201cIn C,\u201d collaborated with the Velvet Underground\u2019s John Cale for Church of Anthrax, and become an in-demand performer, thinker, and lecturer.\nAll of that is on display in the program, which opens with a pond-side conversation with interviewer John Bird. That 7-minute chat is deep and instructive, and puts what follows in a sublime context.\n\u201cMidway through the set I feel this guy has mastered life,\u201d wrote one commenter beneath the YouTube clip, and he\u2019s only wrong about the timing; Riley seems to have mastered life at the start of concert, too, and as the piece progresses, we travel deep inside this mastery as Riley works with keyboards, a reel-to-reel player, and a digital delay to improvise.\nCalledShri Camel, Riley had begun writing the structure of the piece a few years earlier on a commission from the West German station Radio Breman and commenced performing and exploring it in concert not long after. He recorded a studio version ofShri Camelin 1978, which CBS released two years later.\nThe TV performance hits the sweet spot between those dates, when Riley had internalized the piece\u2019s internal logic, allowing him to explore it with an untethered grace."

        "content": "Few people could discuss listening like John Cage. One of the great musical theorists and thinkers of the 20th century, Cage\u2019s ideas on musical and non-musical sounds, and the ways in which silence and noise compliment and compete against each other, helped set the stage for the deep listening movement.\nMost famously, Cage composed perhaps one of the most important sound performances of the past century. Called \u201c4\u201933\u201d and envisioned for the concert hall, it dictated that a pianist approach a grand piano as if to play, set a timer for four minutes and 33 seconds, and then sit in silence without playing a single note.\nThe aim: To force the audience to endure, and hopefully enjoy, the ways in which the absence of the music still begets a kind of sound symphony in the concert hall: the seat creaks, coughs, shuffled concert notes, acoustics\u2013\u2013the so-called ambient noise that music consumes. Is it a performative sleight of hand? Perhaps, but more than 70 years after pianist David Tudor premiered the piece, it still resonates.\nCage\u2019s influential composition, though, overshadows the profoundly beautiful compositions he created, most famously for prepared piano. Using nuts and bolts to upset the tuning of his piano, he createdgentle, muted piecesthat predicted the ambient music movement.\nThe artist certainly wasn\u2019t publicity shy. Despite his academic background and the fount of pursuits that kept him busy (most famously,mycology), Cage appeared on TV in the 1950s and 1960s to expound on sound, often through quirky demos.\nHere he is on the seriesI\u2019ve Got a Secret:\nIn the clip below, Cage plays amplified cacti while, simultaneously in another performance space, the artist Joseph Beuys is performing in the undercarriage a piano. Writer George Plimpton narrates the televised action, which ultimately ends with them seeming to play along to a fireworks display.\nThough each Cage approach is distinct, they\u2019re bound by an overarching philosophy, one encapsulated in the below interview. It occurs in his Manhattan apartment.\nIn 1983, the director Peter Greenaway released a four-part documentary series calledFour American Composers. The Cage episode, which is brilliant, can be viewed below.\nThose interested in watching the entire series, which also features episodes on Meredith Monk, Philip Glass, and Robert Ashley, can do so here:\nhttps://archive.org/details/4ComposersByPeterGreenaway"

        "content": "Before forming Talk Talk in 1981, Mark Hollis was a singer and songwriter attempting, as all aspiring artists do, to take his music to the next level by signing to record label. He\u2019d turned 21 in 1976, when England was in the midst of the first-wave punk explosion that begat bands including the Sex Pistols, the Clash, Buzzcocks, the Slits, Siouxsie & the Banshees, and hundreds more.\nHollis told interviewer Rachael Demadeo in a 1986 interview that for him the most important thing about the punk explosion \u201cwas that it concerned itself with enthusiasm rather than technique and, as such, opened music up to everyone. From a record company point of view, it put them into a position where they no longer understood reasons for success\u2013\u2013they certainly would have difficulty basing upon usual standards for image, song writing or talent. Consequently, it opened the way for many bands to get record deals and an inroad into music as a profession.\u201d\nBut Hollis wasn\u2019t interested in disruption for disruption\u2019s sake. He liked songs and sound, and was particularly struck by garage rockers, R&B singers, and jazz vocalists whose recordings contained depth, dynamics, and empty space.\nHollis, whose older brother Ed managed the proto-punk band Eddie & the Hot Rods, formed the Reaction as punk tore through England, and recorded a demo for Island Records in 1977.\nIf you\u2019ve never heard this version of \u201cTalk Talk Talk Talk,\u201d which was included on a 1977 collection on Beggars Banquet calledStreets, prepare to have your mind blown.\nTwo years later, Hollis and the Reaction recorded a full set of demos. You can hear those two years in the profound artistic evolution that Hollis underwent. You can also hear him maturing as a songwriter as he was pouring all of his energy into it.\nHollis discussed songwriting during a 1982interview with NME:\nI don\u2019t think of songwriting as pure inspiration \u2026 something that comes to you in a blinding flash \u2026 You might get the germ of an idea like that, but you can sometimes try a hundred different ways of putting it into words and still come up with nothing. I heard Anthony Burgess talking about his writing recently and he was saying he can spend six hours writing thousands of words and then throw almost all of them away. It\u2019s the same with songwriting. It\u2019s worth it for the stuff you\u2019re left with at the end. The last thing in the world I would want is to be thought of as a disposable group. I want to write stuff that you\u2019ll still be able to listen to in ten years time\u2026still think of as a good song then.\nHere\u2019s are those Reaction demos, thought to be from 1979. A few of these songs went on to appear in vastly different forms onThe Party\u2019s Overin 1982 and 1984\u2019sIt\u2019s My Life.\nWant more Hollis and/or Talk Talk demos?

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/yukihiro-takahashi/",
        "content": "With his metronomic timing, calm vocal delivery, and movie-star good looks, musician Yukihiro Takahashi left an indelible mark on music and  culture. The co-founder of Yellow Magic Orchestra and, before that, Sadistic Mika Band, passed away on Jan. 11 after being diagnosed with brain cancer. The music world has been in mourning ever since.\nA brilliant drummer with a stylistic flair to match, Takahashi first earned attention in the early and mid 1970s for his work with the Sadistic Mika Band, one of the few Japanese rock acts to make a dent in the West. In the TV performance below, Takahashi barely registers as a presence, though his frantic, inventive drumming propels everything. He makes a quick appearance \u2013 wearing a white bucket hat and horizontally striped shirt \u2013 with a killer breakbeat at the 2:42 moment.\nThree years later he joined Ryuichi Sakamoto and Haruomi Hosono to form Yellow Magic Orchestra. To say it was a rhythmic shift for Takahashi is an understatement. With the Sadistic Mika Band, he was a busy presence, rolling through the bars as if trained by Jack DeJohnette. With YMO, at least in the early years, he was as focused and unrelenting, a human metronome.\nFormed in 1978, Yellow Magic Orchestra moved from rehearsal space to international Japanese music ambassadors within a year. The band made its first visit to Los Angeles in 1979 when they opened for the Tubes at the Greek Theatre. YMO\u2019s label at the time documented the visit with a fantastic short film. Watch it below.\nWhile YMO became a force in Asia and the West, its three members simultaneously focused on solo endeavors. Though Sakamoto\u2019s and Hosono\u2019s work has earned much attention, Takahashi\u2019s records are less known. His solo debut,Saravah!, came out the same year YMO formed and features both Sakamoto and Hosono. Instrumentally, it vibes like a jazz fusion record while laying a pathway for city pop.\nAll told, Discogs logs 43 solo Takahashi albums. Following the release of his debut, he went on to issue 13 records between 1980 and 1990. It\u2019s an endless well of inspiration.\n\u201cDrip Dry Eyes\u201d is perhaps his best known solo song \u2013 and, instrumentally and sonically, a ringer for the Chromatics \u2013 but perhaps that\u2019s in part because it so effortlessly captures Takahashi\u2019s charisma and way with a vocal line.\nIn 1986, the artist harnessed his charm in the opening scene forPoisson D\u2019Avril(Japanese title:Shigatsu no sakana). Watch him make lunch, drink wine, do laundry, feed the dog, and chill in opening scene below.\nTakahashi\u2019s death from cancer marks the end of an era. A brilliant musician and singular presence, his passing serves as a poignant reminder not just of his work, but that his longtime bandmate and peer, Sakamoto, has been fighting the same disease on and off for nearly a decade. Currently diagnosed with stage IV cancer. Sakamoto has a brilliant solo album coming out Friday on Milan. Called12, it was composed, Sakamoto says, after a recent surgery.\n\u201cAfter I finally \u2018came home\u2019 to my new temporary housing after a big operation, I found myself reaching for the synthesizer. I had no intention of composing something; I just wanted to be showered in sound. I\u2019ll probably continue to keep this kind of \u2018diary.\u2019\u201d\nSakamoto disclosed that he currently lacks the stamina to perform a full concert, so he recently began releasing a series of live-in-the-studio clips that, when listened to in sequence, he hopes will be taken as a concert. Here\u2019s Sakamoto performing \u201cMerry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence\u201d last month."

        "content": "More than three decades into his career, Richard D. James remains one of the most enigmatic producer-DJs in electronic music. Though he\u2019s best known for producing landmark music as Aphex Twin, his DJ sets and live performances have become the stuff of legend \u2013 even if he\u2019s never actually released a sanctioned DJ mix.\nThankfully, fans have met the demand, smuggling cassette and DAT recorders into clubs and raves to capture sets in the 1990s and digital devices starting in the \u201900s. Below, a few portals that will time-travel you back.\nJames came up in Cornish, England and got obsessed with early acid house starting in the 1980s. The UK was in the midst of electronic dance music boom, with wildly new rhythms and sounds upending culture on a weekly basis. Influential DJ John Peel was an early advocate, and invited the then-20-year-old James to perform tracks on his radio show. The recording above also includes an early 1990s set from Sheffield.\nBy the middle of the decade, Aphex Twin was securing bookings in the US, which was also in the midst of an ecstasy-fueled desire for hard rhythms pumped through massive club systems. The Limelight was one of New York\u2019s preeminent dance clubs when James jammed this set.\nThe Wisconsin rave promoters Drop Bass did as much as anyone in the States to bring the UK\u2019s open field rave energy to the US. Even Furthur was one of the biggest electronic music festivals in the country, and Aphex Twin played this set early Saturday morning starting at 1:30 a.m. Above is the first 45 minutes of it.\nAphex Twin has never been a consistent touring DJ. His success has afforded him the luxury to play when and where he wants, and do it with serious intention. His appearance at the Day for Night festival in Houston offers sublime evidence. (Note: Aphex Twin\u2019s set doesn\u2019t start until the 10:50 mark.)\nYou\u2019ll laugh, you\u2019ll cry: By 2016, James had mastered the art of controlling the dance floor, and his visit to Field Day in London finds him moving through both bangers and ambient works, shooting out sound waves that seem to simultaneously attack and caress the eardrums.\nFull set from Coachella in 2019, mastered by a user who worked hard to clean up the recording by in order to, he writes in the notes, \u201cspread out the sound \u2026 some fan recorded live stuff is very high on treble and the sound hits you all in the frontal lobe of your brain \u2013 this I remastered in my car so I could hear how it spread through my car speakers \u2013 I did what I think is a good job eliminating the crowd to a degree but not eliminating them completely.\u201d Agreed.\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/dennis-bovel-in-dub-guide/",
        "content": "Originally published in the December, 1977 issue of London-based Sounds magazine,Dennis Matumbi in dub: A Step by Step Guideis a primer from the UK reggae legend himself on how to properly set up a studio for dub mixing. The interview was conducted by the great Vivien Goldman, who, in addition to being an influential music journalist, also contributed vocals and writing on classic records with Prince Far-I, New Age Steppers, The Flying Lizards, Massive Attack, as well as her own release on99 Records.\nThe information presented below is basic, but includes crucial notes for anyone looking to get into dub mixing. For everyone else, it\u2019s always interesting to hear artists talk about their craft. Bovell has an especially charming way of describing dub music and shares a number of gems throughout the article including likening the rhythm guitarist to a two-sided Gemini character and the echo sounds to bees\u2026\nRevisit our featureHow British dub producer Dennis Bovell upended post punk and dub in the UK.\n1.I\u2019m patching in the 16-track machine, the echo machine and the reverb into the plugboard. That brings the tape off the 16-track machine behind me, looping the information off the tape synchronisation and patching all 16 tracks through to the desk (mixing board). Then I can equalise the tracks, that means get all the levels balanced.\n2.This is the tape echo which gives repeat. I\u2019m limiting the echo with my left hand so it doesn\u2019t distort.\n3.That machine on my right captures all that I\u2019m doing. After I\u2019ve plugged in the echo machine and lined it up I set the phaser and the graphic equaliser, as you can see on the picture. That\u2019s what makes the sound go from left to right, like the balance knob on your amp at home. It bends, orphasesall the bass to the finest treble. See how the machine I\u2019m working on\u2019s divided in 2? The section on top together with the bit I\u2019m kneeling by is what gives that phased effect that sounds like an aeroplane flying across the room. I set the machine to a mellow feel\u2026 when the echo goes from left to right across the speakers it sounds like a train going through the room, and when it phases as it goes, it sounds like an aeroplane \u2013 see it deh? Earth and sky\u2026\nThose dials on the right-hand machine are the PPM meters, they show you the level of sound that\u2019s going on the tape. 0 is no sound, and about the highest you can go with reggae music is 6 db (decibels) because reggae bass is so heavy. It\u2019s different with rock. When the bass is that heavy, if the level goes any higher than 6 it makes the grooves on the record interlock when you\u2019re cutting it. Here I\u2019m recording for a master tape, so the speed is 15 i.p.s. (inches per second). Any slower and you get hiss on the tape. That\u2019s why you get better sound quality on 12\u2033 singles, because there\u2019s more room to smear the music right across the plastic.\n4.I\u2019m testing the phase and echo sound. Yeah! It works. With my right hand I\u2019m flicking the echo in and out on the patching board, and I\u2019m flicking the phase in with my left hand.\n5.I\u2019m about to start setting the faders\u2026 Go deh!\nYou look again, the rhythm is running smooth, and now there\u2019s little picks of echo I rip off by the wayside as the rhythm chucks along. Time for ahotdub now!\n6.Now we\u2019re getting into the equalisation tricks. I\u2019m going along one track at a time, each instrument individually, to give it its tone/sound balance. The box at the back is a remote control unit. I can take it with me as I go along the board and it controls the 16-track machine. You see, I\u2019m recording on a 2\u2033 tape which can carry up to 16 different instruments. The desk has 24 different channels.\nI\u2019ll explain to you what all the different knobs on the desk do.\nThe top line is the master volume, which controls the sound level in a different way from the faders (they\u2019re the sliding things I\u2019m pushing with my right hand). The top buttons just make sure the sound doesn\u2019t go over 6db, the faders are more for precise volume control on each so there is no distortion and no instruments peaking above 6db. The next 4 buttons down are equalisation. Notice how each line of buttons goes straight to the corresponding fader.\nThe equalisation ranges from high frequency (called hf, at the tops of that second section of knobs) that\u2019s what gives that sssssssss sound, very fine treble.\nNext down is the mid-range, controlled by the next 2 knobs. Mid-range goes from top to bottom treble sound.\nThe bottom-most of the four knobs is bass, that\u2019s low frequency (lf), very deep.\nSee the way all those four knobs are to different colors? The top\u2019s red and the bottom\u2019s black. You set the bottom half to get the sound roughly, and then you set the top just to skim the top off the sound, to make it more fine, the exact right sound on each instrument.\nIt usually takes me about 20 minutes to set up the board. I put the drum tracks on the far left of the board, the rhythm section in the middle, and the vocals at the far right.\nNow there\u2019s the bottom section of the knobs. The top row here controls the echo sound. See how these knobs are also divided in 2? The top\u2019s the cue send, the bottom\u2019s the cue return.\nIf I turn the top of those knobs, I get echo on that instrument \u2013 one turn is one repeat, two turns is two echos and so on. It\u2019s also activated by that little switch you can just see immediately above. The first switch is for the four knobs above. If I don\u2019t want to change the equalisation I\u2019ve worked out when I\u2019m missing, I\u2019ll leave the switch off and let the equalisation that\u2019s already on the tape come through. You see, the tape recorder\u2019s got two heads \u2013 the synch head, to synchronise all the tracks in time together, and the playback head which gets a fatter tone to the sound.\nThe second switch controls the echo buttons, supplementing the knob underneath. Again, it means I can put any amount of echo on any track.\nBack to the knobs \u2013 the second to bottom line controls the reverb. That\u2019s what gives the spacious effect in stereo. You can turn it to get the exact amount of reverberation you want on every instrument. I never use it on the bass drum because it makes it sound muddy when you want it to hit solid and clear. I put a lot of reverb on the snare drum, it gives it that clicking hollow wooden sound. I want it to to sound as if it\u2019s in a big room. There\u2019s a track each for bass, snare, hi hat, one for each cymbal, and three for the toms \u2013 floor, floating and hanging toms, that is. You can make the drummer tighter in the studio than he was when he was actually playing, see it?\nNow for the bottom line. That\u2019s the pan. Panning the instruments from one speaker to the other is specially essential in dub, of course, shifting the sound from the left hand speaker to the right. Of course, you can shift each instrument individually. It\u2019s like presence control, you can make the sound move forward or back as you want it. The organ goes on the left, and the piano goes on the right \u2013 that\u2019s already the basic rhythm that makes you want to dance, you\u2019re already rocking in stereo!\n7.Me start mix now the tape start run. I\u2019m keeping in tune with the music while I\u2019m mixing. I rock and t\u2019ing, and one, two time I fell off my chair \u2018cos the rhythm touch my head just after the drum and bass start to rock. The snare is under heavy manners, murderer reverb! It start sound like gunshot, it havefire, you understand? On the picture, me just touch it to bring in the rhythm guitar and piano for a touch of echo, just let it go, and hear it\u2026\nYou have to make sure that no instruments covers any other instrument, each one keeps its own time within the timing of the song. We have a picking guitar in reggae that acts like the fullback in football. You know how the fullback guards the goals while the other players are out deh on the field? The fullback covers all the other players? The picking guitar plays the same as the bass guitar but way up high, it covers every bass note. So if the bass drum is covering the bass guitar, flattening the sound, you make sure that you have the picking guitar up loud so that the bass guitar line isn\u2019t drowned out. It is only noticeable when the drum covers the bass.\nThe rhythm guitar is like the policemen of reggae because it keeps all the other instruments in check. It\u2019s like a Gemini character, two-sided, you know? One minute it\u2019s playing with the organ, another minute it rocks with the piano.\nThe piano plays off the beat, the organ plays the double beat, and the sound rocks between the two.\n8.After the first furlong! You look again, the rhythm is running smooth, and now there\u2019s little picks of echo I rip off by the wayside as the rhythm chucks along. Time for ahotdub now! is bass time, drum an\u2019 bass have fe getugly, with WICKED echo running \u2018pon the snare drum, and little filters of echo \u2018pon the hi hat. It\u2019s ites (heights) of dubbing now. In the picture me just a fall off my chair when the bees just lick and touch me in my bones\u2026\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "content": "Cheesy 1990s graphics? Check. Dated approach to documentary TV? Obviously. Woefully America-centric view of stereophonic sound\u2019s evolution? Certainly! Snobbish, mansplaining white-dude talking heads? Of course.\nAll of this can be true and you can still find much to absorb in the \u2018Stereos\u2019 episode of the series Modern Marvels. Filled with information that lays out the basics of stereophonic sound reproduction and the ways in which inventors and sound geeks changed how we listen to music, the 45-minute documentary, which originally aired on the History Channel, offers a primer on the birth and evolution of recorded sound and the rise of high-fidelity stereo systems \u2013 at least the Westernized version of this history.\nStarting with the birth of the medium, the episode delivers its information in easily digestible chunks, with clunky computer graphics, synth-driven library music, an authoritative, deep voiced narrator and lots of Ken Burns-ian pans of old photos.\nOnce you get over the dated style, though, it\u2019s got a lot of great data and first-hand recollections, most notably from speaker builder Henry Kloss, whose work with Acoustic Research, KLH, and Advent helped transform enthusiasts such as himself into pioneers of sound reproduction.\n\u2018Stereos\u2019 also lays out the basics of vinyl recording in a way that\u2019s simple to understand; you\u2019ll exit the episode understanding why 45-degree angles play a crucial role in record playback and amplification, and the ways in which the CD revolution transformed, for better and worse, the business of recording. You also might notice the unfortunate truth that, despite the absolute dominance of Japanese audio companies in the 1970s, none are acknowledged in the episode until Sony earns a mention as leading the ascent of the CD. (Hey, it\u2019s the History Channel, what do you want?)\nHere\u2019s the episode. Note: Though the clip runs 75 minutes, the doc is about half that in length and repeats twice (probably for some algorithmic reason).\nAnd, just because, below is a YouTube clip of the first ever stereophonic sound recording, which is referenced in the Modern Marvels episode. From the video\u2019s notes:\n\u201cThis is the first single groove stereo recording, produced at Bell\u2019s Telephone Laboratories in New York City on June 1, 1934. AC Keller and IS Rafuse had already conceived a way of separating high and low frequencies and recording them on parallel tracks on the same record. Later they found a way of recording two complete sound tracks and reproducing both tracks simultaneously using a single pickup. From this came two full-range bands from left and right microphones in the same groove. In this recording you will hear Bell Lab employees Ted R. D. Collins, Harley A. Henning, and the inventor Arthur C. Keller. The stereo technique was patented by Keller and Rafuse in 1938.\u201d\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "content": "Though many of us have spent hours (days? weeks?) on end consumed in Can live performances over the years \u2013 really, is there any better reason for YouTube? \u2013 the most remarkable thing about the band is their work\u2019s enduring nature. Pop on Monster Movie, Soundtracks or Tago Mago (which we just now did) and their awesomeness remains a glory to behold.\nThis is especially true on a morning after a tense election that increasingly revealed the abyss dividing those of us who exist in reality and those who peddle and amplify lies.\nToday\u2019s amplification involves an undeniable fact: Absorbing deeply felt sounds with intention and a desire for revelation is a noble way to spend your time. Therefore, Can videos.\nOriginally released on their 1973 four-song albumFuture Days, at a little over three minutes \u201cMoonshake\u201d was an outlier, as the record\u2019s three other songs each clocked in at more than 8 minutes. Four years after its release, the band played it on German TV.\nThough the band never toured America and thus didn\u2019t appear on US TV, they were a frequent presence on European shows in the 1970s. Thankfully, Can and their management seemed to say yes to TV appearances at every opportunity. Below, a 6-minute version of a song, Halleluwah, that when it was released onTago Magoran for 18-plus minutes.\nIn the fall of 1976, disco was consuming the world, and though on the surface Can was hardly a disco band per se, they long embraced relentlessly danceable rhythms (even if subdued German audience members mostly sat motionless as they played). \u201cI Want More\u201d is both pure Can and pure disco, and found a home on dance floors around the world, most notably at David Mancuso\u2019s parties at The Loft.\nNow would be a good time to plug YouTube to your hi-fi system \u2013 ideally via a nice DAC for a boost of beefy clarity). Here\u2019s a ferocious full concert from 1971.\nYou know something great\u2019s about to happen with Holger Czukay takes off his top. Though the band seems to stumble at the start \u2013 heroes are human, after all \u2013 soon they lock into a Jaki Liebezeit-fueled groove that confirms Czukay was right to go shirtless. Damo Suzuki is a wildly menacing presence.\nThe below clip captures Can at the Bataclan in Paris, 1973, playing three tracks, \u201cSpoon, \u201cPinch,\u201d and \u201cSing Swan Song.\u201d\nBonus track: The Fall\u2019s song \u201cI Am Damo Suzuki\u201d is the best ode to the Can singer. Though the video below could have better sound, it\u2019s a wicked 8-minute take on a very Can-ish song. This performance was recorded at the Hacienda in Manchester in 1985.\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "content": "By 1972, Sun Ra had firmly established his Arkestra as a formidable presence on the global jazz circuit. While much of the scene was following Miles Davis and his various posses as he forged the templates for fusion and jazz rock, Sun Ra and his massive Arkestra were tapping decidedly unhip Big Band music, adding African drums and jumbo rhythms, and overtaking  concert halls as if the bandleader were leading an alien invasion.\nAt the time, Sun Ra was on a recording tear. He and his band had released five albums since 1969 \u2014 includingAtlantis,My Brother the Wind,The Night of the Purple Moon,My Brother the Wind Volume II (Otherness), andSolar Myth Approach Vols 1+2\u2014 and were fully consumed in capturing the sound of cosmos.\nAnd not just musically: Arkestra performances were full on productions, featuring costumes, choreographed dancers, drum circles, recitations, and buoyant worship. Echoes of Sun Ra\u2019s ideas can be heard everywhere \u2014 including P-Funk\u2019s galactic funk, Janelle Monae\u2019s conceptual Afro-Futurism, Thundercat\u2019s peacocking spirit, and beyond.\nIn fact, so deep is his influence that we often take it for granted. Which brings us to this start-of-the-week post: A 30-minute French TV broadcast from Jan. 8, 1972.\nA whirlwind set that a half-century later remains as wildly inspiring and innovative as when the gig occurred, it finds dozens of Arkestra members worshipping rhythm and music while simultaneously creating it.\nThis set was released on a 2011 DVD, and captures the Arkestra just after they\u2019d concluded their 1971 tour of Europe and Egypt.\nThey play four songs:\nTragically, the final one, Synth, cuts off just as Sun Ra was beginning what was likely an astounding solo.

The success led him to form a whole new band called the Head Hunters, a revolving group that has been occasionally reconvening ever since.\n\u201cThe thing that keeps jazz alive, even if it\u2019s under the radar, is that it is so free and so open to not only lend its influence to other genres,\u201d Hancock told the New York Times during a conversation about Headhunter, \u201cbut to borrow and be influenced by other genres.

At its zenith, the Ibizan club had 20 bars throughout its grounds, a 10,000-person capacity (take into account that the max at Pacha was 3,000 and Amnesia 5,000, just to give you an idea of its scope), and hosted some of the most legendarily hedonistic open-air parties the island has ever seen.\nIt lived during the golden, precious decade in Ibiza before its commercial explosion, when clubbers could swim in the pool and (quite literally) dance the night away under the moonlight until that iconic Spanish sunrise.\nActing as an unofficial asylum for queer and alternative Spaniards, the club provided an inclusive haven to not only dance but share new ideas and concepts. Ku was also the first venue to promote live acts on the island, where the likes of Grace Jones (a frequent attendee), James Brown, Duran Duran, and the Wailers graced the stage.\nCelebrated nightlife photographer Derek Ridgers captured the spirit of KU during a night out in 1984. \u201cIt had the reputation of being the biggest and best club on the island. You might even have been able to say it was the biggest and best club in Europe,\u201d says Ridgers. The venue is centered around the enormous San Rafael pool, complete with a water slide designed like a dragon. \u201cIt was almost like a James Bond film set\u2026 I\u2019d never seen anything like it.\u201d\nKU was also where Ibiza-loving Freddie Mercury and Montserrat Caball\u00e9 filmed the music video for the 1987 hit \u201cBarcelona.\u201d By then, Ku was already a symbol of the island, rivaled the great venues worldwide, and was considered the place to be in the global scene. One of the creative masterminds behind it all, Faruk Gandji, recalls, \u201cIt was like paradise; you could do anything you want. There were no boundaries, no voyeurs, and the drugs were pure. Envision total freedom with beautiful scenery, new music, and a diverse crowd.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Tomorrow another dream will start.\u201dCatch a glimpse of it here in this video uploaded byTestpressing\u2018s Apiento:\nLook De Ibiza (Ku Club Tourist Promo Video)fromApientoonVimeo.\nListen to a playlist with songs featured in the video:\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/bert-jansch-la-turnaround/",
        "content": "In the spring of 1974, Scottish guitarist Bert Jansch commenced recording sessions at label owner Tony Stratton-Smith\u2019s house in Sussex, England and, later, Sound City in Los Angeles. A year prior, the guitarist had left the baroque folk band Pentangle, which he had cofounded with kindred spirit and former housemate John Renbourn. As with their beguiling 1966 album of duets,Bert and John, for Pentangle the two musicians drew on ancient British folk guitar techniques and turnings \u2013 but they amplified them for contemporary audiences reared on rock, jazz and folk.\nA musician\u2019s musician, Jansch was a prolific creator whose long discography includes brilliant studio albums and live recordings. We\u2019re focusing onL.A. Turnaround, a mesmerizing work produced by former Monkee and country rock progenitor Michael Nesmith, which was laid to tape at Luxford house, Sussex on a mobile unit. Legendary pedal steel guitarist Red Rhodes adds beguiling instrumental harmonies.\nLuckily, we don\u2019t need to solely rely on words and sentences to convey the spirit of the sessions. During recording, Jansch allowed a film crew to capture the vibe. The result is a 10-minute documentary that time-travels you into the studio \u2013 and the dining room for dinner breaks and billiards room for bumper pool. That\u2019s a bearded Nesmith with the Texas accent. (Note: You\u2019re not experiencing deja vu; the below YouTube clip for some reason contains two entire edits of the footage.)\n(Tracklist: A1 Fresh as a Sweet Sunday Morning 0:00; A2 Chambertin 3:57; A3 One for Jo; 8:03 A4 Travelling Man 10:42; A5 Open up the Watergate (Let the Sunshine In) 13:30; A6 Stone Monkey 16:10.)\nThose interested in tracing Jansch\u2019s evolution would be advised to take time to experience Jansch and Renbourn playing together in 1966, a year before they\u2019d form Pentangle.\nCurious to know how younger guitarists internalized Jansch\u2019s style? Though it might not sound like it at first, the Smiths\u2019 Johnny Marr has long acknowledged the guitarist\u2019s influence. In the clip below, he outlines the ways that Jansch inspired his own approach to playing.\nAnd, finally, here\u2019s Pentangle performing Hunting Song, which Jansch introduces as \u201ca sort of 13th century rock \u2018n roll song,\u201d on British TV.

        "content": "The Story of Lover\u2019s Rockis a 2011 feature-length doc chronicling the birth and eventual explosion of the beloved sentimental reggae subgenre dubbed lover\u2019s rock. Named after Augustus Pablo\u2019s dancehallfavorite, lover\u2019s rock was an influential and wildly successful style of the 70s and 80s, formed through the muse of one of the genre\u2019s finest, Dennis Bovell. Born Dennis Harris, Bovell produced some of the 80s finest dub, disco, and post-punk grails, both as a solo artist and as a producer (for I Roy, Steel Pulse, The Slits, Saada Bonaire (!), and countless others). In doing so, he revolutionized the sound of British music in the 1980s.\nBut before all that, the reggae maestro defined an entirely novel sound that he called \u201cromantic reggae.\u201d Driven by women singers, lover\u2019s rock was the first female-empowering music in the UK at a time of heightened political tension and unrest. A sound that inspired unique brands of fashion, lifestyle, and dances, the sound galvanized peace and connection as a respite from oppressive and bleak surroundings. Through a series of live performances and interviews with some of the leading names of the era, direcotr Menelik Shabazz charts the rise and lasting impact of the lover\u2019s rock wave. Artists Janet Kay, Carroll Thompson, UB40, Jean Adebambo, Sandra Cross, and more provide an untold portrait of the post-Windrush generation that went on to produce beautiful groove music.Watch the doc uploaded in full on Facebook (embed isn\u2019t available):\nhttps://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=704340610210794"

        "content": "Some artists transcend taste, are so naturally skilled at conveying universal emotion that their\u00a0creations seem somehow unimpeachable. Nina Simone, John Coltrane, Alice Coltrane, Motorhead, Prince, Lee \u201cScratch\u201d Perry, Can, the Shaggs, J Dilla, Daniel Johnston, Kendrick Lamar \u2013 all arrived as if predestined for greatness. Sade Adu, who as the singer of her namesake group Sade has graced international stages since the early 1980s and released six albums of smooth, soulful work that unites R&B, cocktail jazz, soul and roots reggae, is another such artist.\nFormed in London in 1982, the group Sade at its birth featured Adu, guitarist-saxophonist-songwriter Stuart Matthewman, bassist Paul Denman and drummer Paul Anthony Cooke, and were born from the ashes of another outfit, Pride.\nBut you don\u2019t need Sade\u2019s whole biography here. What you should know is that sixteen years after they released their debut,Diamond Life, Sade and band unveiled their fifth album. CalledLover\u2019s Rock, it was inspired by the smooth 1970s reggae subgenre of the same name, but in a singularly Sade-ian fashion. Best known for hits \u201cBy Your Side\u201d and \u201cKing of Sorrow,\u201d the album revels both in bottom-end bass tones and through sibilant, skittery high-hat patterns.\nThat it was produced by Sade and Mike Pela is notable. The group has long co-produced its work, but Pela\u2019s history stretches back to the early 1970s, when he worked with British artists including Electric Light Orchestra, Roy Wood, Fairport Convention and Nico.\nThe below EPK (electronic press kit) was produced by Sony Music clip in conjunction with the release ofLover\u2019s Rock. It features Sade offering a track-by-track rundown of the songs\u2019 origins and creations.

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/perfect-lives-stream/",
        "content": "The complete seven acts of Robert Ashley\u2019s celebrated visual workPerfect Liveshave beenuploaded in their entirety. For those not familiar, here\u2019s a little backstory on one of our favorite American composers:\nAshley was a co-founder of the ONCE Group, an Ann Arbor collective that helped organize early performances by Meredith Monk, Eric Dolphy, and Pauline Oliveros. He was also a member of the Sonic Arts Union, which included David Behrman, Alvin Lucier, and Gordon Mumma. In the 1970s, Ashley directed the legendary Mills College Center for Contemporary Music, whose alumni include some names you may know: Terry Riley, Joanna Brouk, and Steve Reich. At Mills, he taught\u2018Blue\u2019 Gene Tyranny, Maggi Payne, and Peter Gordon. You could argue that Ashley helped legitimize and pioneer contemporary \u201cexperimental music\u201d from its humble beginnings, and that\u2019s undoubtedly true. He, however, would disagree, as he rejects the term \u201cexperimental music\u201d entirely, despite his long history and deep associations with it. He once wrote about the tag, \u201cComposition is anything but experimental; it is the epitome of expertise.\u201d\nAshley\u2019s debut album,Private Parts, which inspired the opera below, sticks to that philosophy. It comprises two side-length pieces, \u201cThe Park\u201d and \u201cThe Backyard,\u201d episodes that bookend the operaPerfect Livesthat later arrived, albeit in a more stripped-down form. These earlier compositions and the newly written parts contain plot \u2013 but were you to try and follow the story linearly, the plot is tough to discern. Ashley even said that some of it makes sense, some doesn\u2019t. Instead, we get a beautiful stream of continuous observations and poetic aphorisms, loaded with satire, metaphysics, humor, and, ultimately the contemplation of the work\u2019s unanswerable theme.\nNotes viaLovely Music\u2019s imprint:\n\u2018Perfect Lives,\u2019 which premiered on UK television, Channel 4, in 1984, is a TV Opera originally commissioned by Kitchen, New York. The opera itself is composed of seven, thirty-minute vignettes, that follow characters from the Corn Belt and their interaction with two out-of-town musicians.\nThe opera is composed of a bank robbery, cocktail lounges, geriatric love, adolescent elopement, and other everyday events in the American Midwest that are both banal and surreal. Each narrative is interlaced with streams of consciousness touching on eastern philosophical concepts to running commentaries on modern capitalist culture. Typical excerpts from the opera are largely conversational, ranging from colloquial \u2018bar talk\u2019 to the more far-reaching philosophical musings on Giordano Bruno, the Renaissance, phenomenology, and learning how to shave.\nAshley\u2019s interests were far-reaching, chaotic, and disjointed. A sufferer of Tourette\u2019s syndrome, this imbued his works with a familiar eeriness of an inner, sometimes sporadic, dialogue that takes place between ourselves and our environment.\nAnother release, recorded over a period of five years, entitled Automatic Writing, \u201cis the result of Robert Ashley\u2019s fascination with involuntary speech. He has recorded and analyzed the repeated lines of his own mantra and extracted four musical characters. The result is quiet, mysterious, melancholy and an early form of ambient music.\nAccording to Ashley, the opera\u2019s structure was based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead. \u201cBlue\u201d Gene Tyranny plays piano (he\u2019s also featured throughout the series as \u201cBuddy \u2013 the World\u2019s Greatest Piano Player\u201d) and arranges all the keys and synths with a minimalist approach and great repetition which, combined with Ashley\u2019s elusive, monotonal musings and Krishna Bhatt\u2019s delicate tablas, warrant some form of transcendent response. In its somber moments, when it doesn\u2019t teeter into abstract game-show-esque territory, it\u2019s hard not to succumb to some kind of meditative state while listening to these cyclical, peaceful rhythms. At the same time, the most bizarre set of \u201880s visuals float across the screen as endless words pour on, hinting at and posing the question:\nWhat happens after we die?\nOf the theoretical underpinnings ofPerfect Lives, Ashley stated, \u201cI put my pieces in television format because I believe that\u2019s really the only possibility for music.\u201d The American tradition, Ashley added, \u201cis not tied to the great opera houses of Europe: La Scala\u2019s architecture doesn\u2019t mean anything to us. We don\u2019t go there. We stay at home and watch television.\u201d\nAshley\u2019s televised opera, which he defines as \u201ca comic opera about reincarnation,\u201d is a beautiful contemplation via text-sound composition and is cited as one of the 20th century\u2019s definitive works in the medium. He is the maestro conducting this perplexing form, revealing the mysterious beauty that lies in listening to art embedded in sound and vision.\nWatch the opera in full below:"

We\u2019ve featured the Japanese all-kind music pioneer quite a few times now:\u00a0highlighting hisessential productionsas one of the major architects of modern Japanese pop music; posting scans from his science fictiongraphic novel Globule; and more recently focusing on hisdowntempo and abstract electronicworks from the \u201990s. We\u2019re not stopping there.\nA crucial and often overlooked period in the great Hosono\u2019s vast musical world is the \u201cCrown Years\u201d from 1974-1977. Just prior to forming Yellow Magic Orchestra with Ryuichi Sakamoto and Yukihiro Takahashi, Hosono explored jazz fusion, exotica, and lounge music with his band Tin Pan Alley. Inspired by Van Dyke Parks, Martin Denny, Sly Stone, and New Orleans blues man Professor Longhair, Hosono created his own uniquely Japanese exotica sound by fusing traditional instruments and melodies with ukulele, banjo, pedal steel guitar, percussion, and flute. The albumsTropical DandyandBon Voyagemarked the beginning of Hosono\u2019s fascination with \u201coriental aesthetics,\u201d which would carry directly over into the Yellow Magic Orchestra years.\n\u201cThe thing was to take these western ideas of the exotic, but to subvert them. With Martin Denny, the exotica is kind of fake. But I am real!\u201d\nAmazingly, quality footage exists of Hosono and Tin Pan Alley playing live across Japan. Recorded in Yokohama\u2019s Chinatown and various parts of Tokyo, the performances feature exotic sets filled with sunsets, tropical plants, bamboo panels, and colorful shirts. The footage was released as part of a 2007 4-disc box set called Crown Years. The physical set is a bit hard to find, but luckily someone posted the videos to YouTube.

More than half a century after they formed in 1965 \u2013 and nearly as long as they gobbled their first doses of acid \u2013 the band runs the FM airwaves like few others.

Considered the Big Bang of space rock, the cosmic rock song taps a magnetic riff, repeats it, repeats it again and again and again and again until it propels upward. Whether you\u2019ve never heard it or have been lost inside the riff for years, it\u2019s a mindblower. Syd Barrett was still a member of the band when they recorded it, but by 1970 he had left amid struggles with mental health and substance abuse.

The band had just returned from their first gigs in the U.S., where they had played the famed Paradise Garage in New York and the way-less-famed Billy Barty\u2019s Roller Fantasy in Orange County. While they were in the States, their essential single \u201cBlue Monday\u201d was heading up the British charts, in the process increasing their stature on the world stage and setting the scene for a grand artistic breakthrough that was \u201cPower, Corruption and Lies.\u201d\nThis backdrop makes the performance below, of \u201cLonesome Tonight\u201d at the Ha\u00e7ienda essential, as it captures the band fully extricating itself from Curtis\u2019 shadow to create a sound uniquely their own. And while New Order singer Bernard Sumner lacks Curtis\u2019 electrifying stage presence, the sound they create remains as crucial now as when it was originally forged.\nIn celebration of In Sheep\u2019s Clothing\u2019s evening with the early music ofFactory Records and 4AD, which occurs tonight at Neuehouse, enjoy this astounding moment in time: New Order on their home turf."

        "content": "The In Sheep\u2019s Clothing Residency at Neuehouse Hollywood is nearing its official close on September 23rd, and we\u2019ve been hard at work programming special sessions for these last few evenings of summer. The entire ISC team are big fans of Arthur Russell, and though his music has found eager audiences posthumously, there\u2019s still a lot of room to explore. We\u2019ll be sharing a deeper dive into his personal discography and his collaborations to offer even more context to why he is beloved by many. There are still a few spots available for the session this Saturday September 4th, so make sure toRSVP now to secure your spot.\nIt\u2019s hard not to wonder if filmmaker Phill Niblock and sound engineer Steve Cellum knew they were capturing an important moment in history when they recorded this 1985 solo performance. Russell spent most of time in his studio composing a seemingly endless catalog of tracks, a large portion of which were never finished due to his obsession with perfection. Even still, he was sought after by the likes of Larry Levan, Brian Eno, David Byrne and Philip Glass for his uncanny sixth sense of finding new musical terrain to anchor into.\nFew videos exist of his live shows, but this one captures Russell in such a penetrating simplicity with the cello, an instrument he played since he was a child. His perfectly pitched voice croons and howls on a few tracks from his record \u201cWorld of Echo.\u201d Filmed on a single phosphor-tube color camera, the extreme close ups and washed-out color gradient matches the ethereal mood that Russell\u2019s music famously inhabits. This perfect melodic meditation possesses a spiritualized quality to it that will ease the anxiety out of your bones and into a safe world of harmony."

        "content": "When the UK new wave/synth-pop band Japan split in 1983, they were at the peak of their popularity. Creative differences sent the members in different directions, and the frontman and principal songwriter David Sylvian finally had the license to explore more esoteric sounds. Sylvian released his first solo recordBrilliant Treesa year later, and for it he pulled in his sonic kindred spirits. Ryuichi Sakamoto, Jon Hassell, Holger Czukay, and Mark Isham traveled to Berlin to help craft Sylvian\u2019s vision. Luckily photographer Yuka Fujii had the foresight to visually capture these greats as they supported the transmutation of a pop idol into a brilliant artist.\nThe edited video was recently posted 36 years after the release ofBrilliant Trees, and with it comes a written introduction by Sylvian himself. The essay provides necessary color that highlights the enchanting disbelief at seeing these iconic figures in a recording studio together. Czukay, co-founder of Can, performs his analog alchemy while sitting on the floor with Sylvian at one point. In another notable moment, Sylvian is side-by-side behind a grand piano with good friend Sakamoto of Yellow Magic Orchestra. Sakamoto knew little English when this was filmed, so much of their communication took place by way of musical instrumentation.\nWhat makes this 40-minute video a mandatory watch, though, is the extended cut of Hassell, who recently passed away. The father of fourth world music engages in lengthy dialogue about Indian music theory, among other topics. He goes on to record his signature electronically modulated trumpet, and it howls into the infinity where he now rests."

        "content": "Music and politics seem to veer away from each other as the decades go on, but there\u2019s an effortless power that melody and lyrical poetry has on awakening emotions ranging from hope to anger. For some musicians their very existence is political, and there is no better representation of that than in the story of South African singer, songwriter, and activist Miriam Makeba. She was only 18 days old when her mother, a traditional healer and domestic worker, was arrested by the apartheid government for making alcoholic ferments at home. Baby Miriam was taken to prison with her. It\u2019s ironic that a young life so carelessly thrown in jail would soon become the songbird of the South African revolution.\nThere were many popular musicians who used their platforms to continue the fight for the rights of Black South Africans, even in the violent face of a colonially minded government. Hugh Masekela was among the few Black artists like Makeba who had a national audience, and as the movement they helped cultivate grew, the government became even more sensitive and draconian.\nMakeba was eventually exiled in response to a film she had a starring cameo in calledCome Back to Africa. Shot by American political filmmaker Lionel Rogosin, the docu-fiction was shot in secret in South Africa under the very real threat of not only arrest but retaliation.\nOnce the rolls of film crossed the country\u2019s borders, they were edited and released \u2014 to great\u00a0 fanfare from global film festivals \u2014 for its illuminating perspective and stunning visual treatment. Makeba was returning from a screening of the film at the 24th Venice Film Festival when she learned that her passport had been revoked without warning.\nThough her musical performance in the film lasted a mere 4 minutes, it would take nearly 30 years before she was allowed to return to South Africa. In that time she was a tireless diplomatic voice for the end of Apartheid.\nThe film was recently shared online in stunning quality, and the reality it reveals makes it a compulsory watch for all fans of South African music genres from Cape jazz to bubblegum pop."

Released in 2019, the film explores the ways in which the artist, who died in 2007, spread her messages and music.\nThe film, which was produced by Luaka Bop, Boiler Room and Petite Planetes, captures a musical ceremony during Sunday gathering at the Ashram not long before it closed in 2017. When Alice was alive, she led her community in these meditations and released a number of them on her private label. Gliding through traditional Sanskrit chants, mantras and original compositions, the artist captured the essence of music\u2019s ability to transcend language.\nCo-directors Vincent Moon and Priscilla Telmon shot the ceremony and edited it into a stunning piece on sound, love and unity. It includes narration by Alice\u2019s sister, singer Marilyn McLeod. Sadly, the Ashram burned to the ground during the 2018 Woolsey Fire.\nEven before the fire, one narrator in the film stressed that the loss of the physical space wouldn\u2019t hinder the teachings that Alice \u2014 or, as her students called her, Swamini \u2014 offered. \u201cWe will continue this path that Swamini set us on. Sometimes we will continue excellently, sometimes not so excellently, but we will continue.\u201d He added, \u201cWhatever we do, Swamini\u2019s work is spreading out. There\u2019s no stopping that.

The truth was much simpler, and even more tragic: one of the great jazz players of the 1960s had apparently committed suicide at age 34.\nReleased in 2005, the documentaryMy Name is Albert Ayleris a remarkable look at the artist\u2019s life and work. It was directed by Swedish documentarian Kasper Collin, and features interviews with Ayler\u2019s bandmates including his brother Donald and drummer Sonny Murray. Murray tells the story of meeting Ayler for the first time in Europe in the early 1960s, and how the then-unknown saxophonist convinced Murray to let him play at a Cecil Taylor gig. Taylor said no, but Murray snuck him on and Ayler proceeded to stun Taylor into silence.\nAs New Yorker critic Richard Brody wrote of the film, \u201cThe ne plus ultra of free jazz, Ayler performed the musical equivalent of speaking in tongues: he left chord changes and swinging rhythms far behind and emitted great spiritual wails and shrieks from his horn. Collin expertly evokes the revolutionary impact of Ayler\u2019s arrival in New York in 1963, when an astonished John Coltrane yielded the bandstand to him.\u201d\nColtrane, in fact, requested that Ayler perform at his funeral. Ayler did, and the documentary features that astounding moment. The whole film is a revelation.\nWatch it below:"

It\u2019s a perfect gateway into post-bop jazz for those who have struggled to absorb it. The band descends in and out of tasteful chaos with a natural grace.\nThe soul of the performance is Mingus on the contrabass, who plays with so much warmth and fury that it rounds off the rough edges. Dolphy variously plays alto sax, flute and bass clarinet, cutting through the delightful cacophony with a unique tone and style that makes his horns sing like a siren. Dannie Richmond plays drums, John Arthur \u201cJaki\u201d Byard bangs on the piano and Clifford Jordan blows on his tenor sax, each playing with an equally compelling manner that makes this performance a must watch for any jazz lover."

Their stylistic nods to ancient Egypt were especially prominent. His namesake, Ra, is the all powerful sun god who humbled the people of the pyramids. This grafting of culture was especially prominent in his time, as Black spiritualists in the United States were inspired by the mystical and occult knowledge of the African kingdom of ancient Egypt.\nWhen Sun Ra finally made the pilgrimage to Cairo in 1971, his wildly free and potent intuition\u00a0 led the way. When he was struck with the idea, the band had been touring Scandinavia and were on their last stop in Denmark. They sold original tapes of their live show recordings in Copenhagen to eager Danes, in the process easily earning the cash to bankroll the Arkestra\u2019s ambitious journey.\nThe Arkestra had reached peak popularity: Not only did Ra teach at the UC Berkeley that year, but he also seduced the mainstream by landing a coveted spot on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine. This newfound fame, however, did him little good when they attempted to clear Egyptian customs. Suspicious of their odd instruments, officials confiscated them. It pays off to have friends from high places: They were soon saved by drummer Salah Ragab, the godfather of Egyptian jazz \u2014 and a colonel in the country\u2019s military. He used his rank to get their instruments released. Once free, they toured the region and recorded the shows along the way. These recordings were edited and released on Ra\u2019s Saturn label as Dark Myth Equation Visitation, Nidhamu, and Horizon. Last year Rough Traderereleasedthe three records. They deliver insight into the sonic zeitgeist of those precious few weeks.\nThis period left an indelible mark on Ra and the Arkestra, which can be seen and appreciated in their shift in the visual language post-Egypt. For Ra, it also confirmed his theory that as objects move through physical space, they create sonic waves that should be interpreted as music too. A turning point for one of the most beloved characters in jazz, this work reveals how truly magical Ra is."

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/meredith-monk-book-of-days-1988/",
        "content": "Those familiar with the work of vocalist Meredith Monk likely know her as the innovative artist who has stretched her vocal cords in striking new directions. However, the ambitious experimental singer who transformed Western vocal music also reimagined several artistic disciplines\u2014often blending and blurring forms in exciting and experimental ways. During her five-plus decades as a composer and choreographer, she has staged dances that were operas, operas that were dances, and mythical theatre pieces that were somehow both.\nAfter groundbreaking vocal works including 1971\u2019s Key and 1973\u2019s Our Lady Of Late, Monk made her first foray into feature-length film with a live taping of Quarry. Her opera in three movements was accompanied by a silent short film of the same name.\nStaged with her legendary theatre company The House, in 1975-1976, the opera shares similar themes with her subsequent masterwork,Book. The filmed piece concentrates on World War ll, and meditates on the darkness plaguing our society that, even when overcome, is somehow recycled into our history. WithQuarry, Monk touches on the themes she would revisit in her own work \u2014 war, cruelty, intolerance, fascism, all viewed from the first-hand experience of a dying girl.\nConsidered to be one of the great stage acts of the 20th century, Monk spent more than a\u00a0 decade to work on her next project. In 1988 Monk took her first stab at a proper \u201cnarrative\u201d film\u00a0 (albeit the way only she could).Book of Daysis an experimental hybrid of medieval musical theatre, avant-garde choreography,\u00a0 and performance art, with a Bergman-esque pseudo-documentary feel that\u2019s soundtracked by Monk and a twelve-voice ensemble. The haunting film tells the story of a young girl named Eva living in a Jewish community during the middle ages, an enclave that evokes raw stillness, a time before machines and the abrasive noise and speediness of modern-day. Eva begins to have prophetic visions of 20th-century technology and society that prompt her to draw strange objects on the walls. First a TV set, then a plane, then a gun.\nA plague strikes the village and leads to a war between the Christian and Jewish communities \u2014 and the fight is over who\u2019s to blame for a sudden pandemic. (Sound familiar?) A meditation on silence that\u2019s constantly intruded by madness, it captures the essential joy and suffering of human nature.\nFor a proper film synopsis, Monk\u2019s website explains the film: \u201cBook of Daysis a film about time, originally drawing parallels between the Middle Ages, a time of war, plague, and fear of the Apocalypse, with modern times of racial and religious conflict, the AIDS epidemic, and fear of nuclear annihilation. In light of the current pandemic of 2020, the cyclical nature of such phenomenon has made itself known once more. While the film provides no answers, it nevertheless is a tribute to vision and the imagination, and a poetic incantation of that which connects us.\u201d\nMusic from the film was released on ECM that same year and stands as a bonafide masterpiece on its own. Monk integrates a similarly striking vocal stillness, composing a spatial soundtrack of primarily modal monophonic melodies that reference Jewish and Gregorian sacred songs. The result is a collection of profoundly moving recordings, epic and full of drama, that manages to combine the authentic 14th-century music with her revolutionary vocal innovations. Truly a transcendent work both in sound and form, only a pioneering experimentalist like Meredith could pull off.\nWatch a clip below and stream the entire film here:https://vimeo.com/ondemand/bookofdays"

        "content": "This video documents the trumpet player and father of \u201cfourth world\u201d music, Jon Hassell, in one of his most extraordinary live recordings. Filmed in what has been renamed as Brookfield Place but is still commonly known as \u201cThe Financial Center\u201d by longtime New Yorkers, the space was recently reopened after a series of renovations resulting from its partial destruction during the September 11th attacks.\nThe towering palms still stand in the atrium, and it creates a surreal juxtaposition with surrounding contemporary urban architecture. This sets an ideal environment to house Hassell\u2019s unified primitive and futurist compositions. Eno had a hand in creating this maximalist vision and went as far as outfitting the venue with 200 speakers that night. Eno was also behind the board, carefully live mixing the entire performance.\nHassell plays his trumpet in a seated position, and the slithering moans of his instrument are modulated by a series of pedals. The mood is brooding but is softened by the intermittent sounds of the rainforest at night, bird songs and other samples from the natural world."

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/durutti-column-live-1981-1991/",
        "content": "Vini Reilly of Durutti Column was the first signing by Factory Records\u2019 Tony Wilson to the now cult UK label, and he would forever stand as its one true outlier. The virtuoso guitar player offered a far more intimate sound, releasing instrumental records (with few hesitative vocal exceptions) that contained melancholy, meditative guitar sketches that completely offset the branded abrasive and dancier sounds surrounding him on the Factory Records roster.\nDurutti Column was also known to be Wilson\u2019s favorite act; he stated once in an interview that his car was filled with Durutti CDs and that he didn\u2019t much listen to his label\u2019s breadwinning acts like New Order and The Happy Mondays. For Wilson, who was the subject of the biopic 24 Hour Party People, Factory was all about Durutti Column. Reilly\u2019s unique classical approach to so-called new wave earned famous fans, most notably Brian Eno, who once stated that Durutti\u2019s 1981 releaseLC(AKALotta Continuaor\u201cContinuous Struggle\u201d) was his favorite album.The \u201coutlier\u201d role would also play out in his approach to performing. Reilly was notoriously stage-shy and seldom played live. Maybe it was because of the minimalist music, or that the melancholy instrumentals didn\u2019t quite translate to the live setting or cater enough to the expectation of concertgoers who were more interested in the uptempo pop standards of the day. And seeing a sparse lineup \u2014 usually only Vini with his effect-treated guitar and minimal percussion provided by Bruce Mitchell \u2014 didn\u2019t seem all that entertaining compared to the rest of his Factory family. That scarcity makes the below unearthed live performances all the more special, as they\u00a0 showcase Vini\u2019s masterful abilities.The earliest filmed Durutti Column performance was in Helsinki in 1981. The set appears to be at some kind of summer festival with thousands of stoic Finnish spectators in attendance. Most of them don\u2019t seem to know what to make of what they\u2019re seeing, appearing ambivalent, confused or mesmerized. Forty years later, this is prime Reilly playing Durutti classics like \u201cSketch for Summer,\u201d \u201cMissing Boy,\u201d and \u201cSketch for Dawn.\u201d\nHere is an expanded line-up of Durutti at the Royal Northern College in Manchester in 1991, featuring the addition of Keir Stewart on bass and keyboard. Reilly also makes use of his Rhodes keyboard side stage with updated takes on DC classics like \u201cJacqueline,\u201d \u201cOpera\u201d and \u201cDay is Over.\u201d\nAnd finally, here\u2019sDomo Arigato,a rip of the original VHS release by Factory (FACD144) featuring Durutti filmed live in Tokyo on April 25, 1985 at Gotanda Kan\u2019i Hoken Hall. This may be the best vintage footage of DC in the 80s, and it also features a more rounded lineup. Bruce Mitchell returns on drums with the addition of John Metcalfe on violin and Tim Kellet playing trumpet. Reilly is more keyboard-focused here as well, taking turns using his Rhodes and DX7 while Mitchell hops off the kit for a few tracks (with the help of a drum machine) to play marimba.Domois one of the few concert films Factory released, most likely thanks to Tony Wilson, and it features DC at their 80s best."

        "content": "In 1994, MTV ran a documentary on the British label Too Pure, which had been founded four years earlier with early releases from Stereolab, PJ Harvey and Seefeel. The 30-minute profile recently traveled through social media circles, and it\u2019s a fascinating time capsule.\nFeaturing extensive interviews with co-owners Richard Roberts and Paul Cox, it offers brief profiles of and conversations with essential Too Pure contributors Laika, Moonshake and Pram.\nThe video caught Too Pure at peak influence. It sprinted out of the gate with massive debut indie releases from PJ Harvey, Stereolab and woefully ignored shoegaze band Th\u2019 Faith Healers, prompting bidding wars that found Harvey and Stereolab signing to majors.\nHere are some classic Too Pure tracks from those early days.\nTaken from the band\u2019s album \u201cTransient Noise Bursts With Announcements,\u201d this track typifies the band\u2019s revolutionary re-amplification and channeling of ideas set forth by German bands including Neu, Kraftwerk and Can.\nThe crucial London band Seefeel was founded in 1992 and nearly 30 years later their records feel brand new. Their debut album, \u201cQuiqui,\u201d was reissued by Light in the Attic a few years ago, and this official video for \u201cIndustrious\u201d offers sublime evidence of their influence.\nSeemingly allergic to the sound of guitar, Pram\u2019s earliest music for Too Pure is often eclipsed by the Stereolab stuff, but Pram was just as individualistic (and less beholden to Neu! melodies). After success on Too Pure, the group moved to Domino, and have issued a catalog rich with experimentation.\nA rhythm band a la ESG or Konk, Laika was founded by Margaret Fiedler (lead vocals, programming) and producer-musician Guy Fixsen. This track is from the band\u2019s 1994 Too Pure album \u201cSilver Apples on the Moon.\u201d\nDriven by rave-inspired rhythms and sublime repetition, Th\u2019 Faith Healers were a guitar band that thrived on heavy dynamics and huge bursts of distortion.\nNamed for the Can song, Moonshake didn\u2019t hide the influence. Heavy on Liebezeit-style percussion and Pop Group-style political invectives, the band\u2019s first album for Too Pure, \u201cEva Luna,\u201d is a dollar bin classic. Founded by David Callahan, its early incarnation featured heavy contributions from Laika\u2019s Margaret Fiedler. \u201cWe were different people and wrote differently, but came from the same influences \u2013 Can, PIL, Kraftwerk, Eric B & Rakim, and MBV to name a few bands,\u201d Fiedler told one interviewer. \u201cMoonshake was a collision. It was supposed to be a collision.\u201d"

        "content": "Arthur Russell\u2019s exceptionally distinctive musical perspective mesmerized many. From the start of his career in late \u201860\u2019s San Francisco he was a sought after collaborator, and early on made a fateful connection with poet Allen Ginsberg. Russell, while studying Western composition and Indian classical music, played his cello during Ginsberg\u2019s readings. As he evolved, Russell invented new musical structures and obsessively shaped them into new forms; securing an endpoint for these experiments seemed virtually irrelevant to him.\nSurprisingly, Russell was obsessed with producing pop hits in an array of genres. It was a curious paradox, and though he was just chasing his muse it was hard for many to understand this at the time. Tragically, he never got to see this dream fully realized. Like too many irreplaceable souls, Russell was a victim of the AIDS epidemic during its early 1990s peak. It wasn\u2019t until relatively recently that his surviving creative family, such as the late Ginsberg, Phillip Glass and David Byrne, would help facilitate the release of works from his trove of music. Since then, more than one thousand reels of tape, hundreds of pages of song lyrics and poetry have been sifted through and compiled in his memory. Most of it is released through Audika, a label founded by Russell\u2019s estate to keep the music flowing. Below, Ginsberg, Glass and Byrne sit down to remember Russell\u2019s legacy and talk about his work onAnother Thought.\nBe With Records are reissuingAnother Thoughton vinyl this November.

Haino approaches the concept of freedom without angst, and his psychedelic, often noisy improvisations showcase this philosophy. From refusing anything close to standard tuning for his instruments to consciousness filling every inch of his performance space with his explicit awareness, the unpretentious yet cerebral perspective he shares is both sharp and a joy to listen to.

It was the mid sixties, and Eno was studying painting and experimental music at uni in the south coast of England. He was leaning towards the visual arts but soon became bored of the cultural obsession with conceptual art at the time. From what he could gather,\u00a0the emerging rock n\u2019 roll scene was far more exciting and had no canon in which he had to fit into.\nA few years later Eno would emerge as the synth player in the popular band Roxy Music and he\u2019s been inextricably linked to music since; though he underscores in the interview,\u00a0it\u2019s not music that defines him even if that\u2019s what he\u2019s most known for.\nPerhaps one of the most endearing moments of the interview is when Eno proudly tells the story of how he managed to \u201cmake use of the facilities\u201d, when Marcel Duchamp\u2019s conceptual piece \u201cFountain\u201d was on display at the Tate Modern in New York.

As a young boy growing up on the coast in Rio de Janeiro, he was thrilled by the North American bebop and jazz flowing into Brazil from artists like Oscar Moore of the Nat King Cole Trio and Dizzy Gillespie. It may have been prophetic, because Bola Sete would find his musical future in the United States and it was Dizzy Gillespie himself who mentored him into the scene. Sete would never stray far from the breezy string stylings that are so uniquely Brazilian, and it was precisely this that made him a sought-after collaborator by jazz musicians around the world.\nHere he plays with the Vince Guaraldi Trio in San Francisco, where Bola Sete called home for most of his life. This performance was organized to promote a new record they had just release simply titled, \u201cVince & Bola\u201d.

        "content": "In 1975 Robert Ashley embarked on an ambitious fourteen-hour documentary series investigating, interviewing, and showcasing performances of his contemporaries. Designed as a sort of tele-opera, each of the lengthy episodes highlighted and experimentally constructed profiles of his Lovely Music roster and affiliates. David Behrman, Pauline Oliveros, Terry Riley, Alvin Lucier and Gordon Mumma all get a similar treatment, with the finale of the episodes reserved for Ashley himself. At times the series can be indulgent, but if you have the time and patience the grandiose experiment succeeds in narratively presenting a thorough study of his generation of a like-minded school of post-Cage composers.\nHere\u2019s how Ashley describes this monumental work:\n\u201cMusic with Roots in the Aether is a music-theater piece in color video. It is the final version of an idea that I had thought about and worked on for a few years: to make a very large collaborative piece with other composers whose music I like. The collaborative aspect of Music with Roots in the Aether is in the theater of the interviews, at least primarily, and I am indebted to all of the composers involved for their generosity in allowing me to portray them in this manner.\nThe piece turns out to be, in addition, a large-scale documentation of an important stylistic that came into American concert music in about 1960. These composers of the \u201cpost-serial\u201d / \u201cpost-Cage\u201d movement have all made international reputations for the originality of their work and for their contributions to this area of musical compositions.\nThe style of the video presentation comes from the need I felt to find a new way to show music being performed. The idea of the visual style of Music with Roots in the Aether is plain: to watch as closely as possible the action of the performers and to not \u201ccut\u201d the seen material in any way\u2013that is, to not editorialize on the time domain of the music through arbitrary space-time substitutions.\nThe visual style for showing the music being made became the \u201ctheater\u201d (the stage) for the interviews, and the portraits of the composers were designed to happen in that style.\u201d\nThe result is a rewarding and insightful watch, especially for those who admire these legendary artists.

In the early scenes of the film, McLean is asked how he felt about being a legend, and replies, \u201cI feel like an exploited, poor musician in 1976, if you want to know how I feel, and I also feel like a professor of history at the University of Hartford. If I feel good about anything, it\u2019s about being able to turn down jobs that are offered to me for scale and below\u2026 that\u2019s what I feel good about.\u201d\nThe doc features some incredible, candid footage of McLean in his element as an educator. In one scene, he\u2019s seen joyfully conducting a group of children as they count, directing each number as if it were a note in a composition. In another, he gets into a heated discussion with university students on how to work within the commercial music industry, the importance of preserving jazz as American classical music, and Sun Ra.\nWatch the full documentary below:"

This 1966 documentary captures the famously coolheaded Coleman as he leads his trio in recording the soundtrack ofWho\u2019s Crazy, an American film made in Belgium. A previously unknown copy of the 1966 absurdist film was found in 2015 and released to critical fanfare. The LP of its soundtrack was circulated but rare, and for the first time in decades fans finally got a look at what inspired the noodley melodies that teeter on the edge of madness.\nThere isn\u2019t much footage of Coleman talking, but throughout the documentary he encourages the other players, David Izenzon and Charles Moffett, with an endearing lisp. He offers thoughts on his public perception between shots of him tuning his violin and the romantic backdrop of Paris, the combination of which keeps a smile on your face for the entire 30 minutes."

Illustrious musicians were invited by his grandfather to perform at their family home every evening. He was singing by the age of six and before long decided, against his mother\u2019s wishes, to devote his life to music. He left home at age thirteen and studied for twenty years as a disciple of Ustad Abdul Wahid Khan, the foremost master of the Kirana Gharana,which descends from Gopal Nayak (ca. 1300), and is also known as the style of Krishna. Pran Nath\u2019s performances on All India Radio since 1937 and at Music Conferences throughout India established his reputation as a leading interpreter of Kirana style with an exceptional knowledge of traditional compositions and the delineation of raga.\u201d\n\u2014 Composer Mariam Zazeela.Pran Nath\u2019s unwillingness to compromise his country\u2019s traditional music and implement popular elements to appeal to modern tastes garnered him the label a \u201cmusician\u2019s musician.\u201d He soon became the world\u2019s leading exponent of the Kirana style and soon began traveling the world to teach. The Indian classical master\u2019s influence would be largely felt by the pioneering NYC minimalist scene, finding devout disciples in Terry Riley, Jon Hassell, Mariam Zazeela and La Monte Young, each of whom traveled to India to seek further tutelage.\nDuring Robert Ashley\u2019s curative direction at Mills College, Pran Nath taught artists working in a wide range of disciplines and genres. Avant-jazz performers Don Cherry and Lee Konitz; composers Jon Gibson, Yoshimasa Wada and Rhys Chatham; new age pianists Michael Harrison and Allaudin Mathieu; mathematician Christer Hennix; conceptual artist Henry Flynt; dancer Simone Forti; and many others were influenced by Pran Nath\u2019s teachings.\nWatch the full documentary below:"

        "content": "Andy Warhol is rightly regarded as a multidisciplinary visual artist first, but his gratuitous charm and charismatic nature made him a protagonist in many infamous musical happenings. A regular at many legendary clubs from the \u201860s to the \u201880s, he was no stranger to celebrity. That can be seen in his many curiosities, as well as his interactions with musical muses, including Grace Jones and, most famously, the Velvet Underground & Nico. For this video, Warhol picks up his film camera and tapes a performance of his VU muses in a cramped New York studio.\nThis performance doesn\u2019t capture the popular side of the Velvet Underground & Nico. Instead the band jams in a poetic cacophony that sounds little like their many memorable songs. One commenter likened the sound to Indian raga but \u201cby american electric instruments,\u201d and that describes it. The sweet and almost maddening electric drones are meditative, and Warhol inserts himself into the experience with wild use of zoom and little interest in protecting the fourth wall.\nPerhaps the most endearing part of the film \u2014 besides Nico\u2019s young boy aimlessly wandering to band members \u2014 happens just after 52:00. The NYPD come in to shut down the performance. The video continues for another ten minutes. From that point it\u2019s pure cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 and a glimpse of a kind of moment fans seldom get to see: Legends not conjuring up a spectacle but moving through space as regular human beings."

Kuti\u2019s mother, Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti, was a political campaigner and women\u2019s rights activist, so it\u2019s no wonder this sensibility was reflected in her son.\nCaptured at the Berlin Jazz Fest in 1978, the film itself does an incredible job of underscoring the drama of this memorable performance.

Funky blues guitarist Earl King follows him. With the support of the Meters, he delivers an intense performance. King had his own solo career, but was more successful writing songs for Fats Domino, Dusty Springfield and Jimi Hendrix.

The Montreux Jazz Festival started in 1967 by locals in the music industry, who teamed with Atlantic Records cofounders Ahmet and Nesuhi Ertegun. The partnership ensured a pipeline of visionary musicians including Miles Davis, Peter Tosh, Nina Simone and Herbie Hancock.\nThe festival\u2019s early events occurred at the Montreux Casino, but it infamously burned down in 1971, apparently during a performance by Frank Zappa. Members of Deep Purple were in the audience, and proceeded to write \u201cSmoke on the Water\u201d after the incident. In the early \u201990s, the festival expanded with help of famed producer Quincy Jones. Before the pandemic, each year about 250,000 jazz freaks made the pilgrimage to Montreux.\nThe video below is from 1982. It\u2019s the second performance of Gilberto Gil at the festival, and here he plays some of his funkier tracks. Gil was one of the main drivers of the late 1960s psychedelic Tropicalia movement in Brazil, but across the years his style crossed into many genres, and this performance demonstrates that beautifully. With signature charm and ease, he wins over the audience. One of the most endearing moments is a call-and-response among Gil, his band and the crowd."

Something must have been in the autumnal air that night at the Berlin Jazz Fest, because Monk delivers one of his most dazzling performances. The way Monk plays keeps his listeners at the edge of their seats, and interestingly it\u2019s that same unconventional freedom that made him an outcast in the beginning of his career. With that in mind, there\u2019s a redemptive quality to the delight that arrives with the crowd\u2019s applauses.\nThe first 20 minutes is Monk alone at the piano, playing with an exciting fervor that has him sweating profusely. When he\u2019s joined at the end of the show by the uniquely captivating voice of Vaughan, Johnny Veith on piano, Gus Mancuso on bass and Eddy Pucci on drums, the group create the kind of vulnerable tenderness you have to see to believe.

Laaraji\u2019s first taste of fame came from a chance role in director Robert Downey\u2019s cult 1968 advertising satire Putney Swope, but that was well before he found his calling as a musician. It wasn\u2019t until he made what on the surface seemed to be notably bad trade \u2014 his state-of-the-art keyboard for a much cheaper zither \u2014 that he found his musical voice.\nThe moment he first strummed the zither in that pawn shop, the story goes, one of the clerks called out in ecstasy that they felt as if the heavens opened up. That communion of healing and the realities of New York life called out to him, and he made the switch.\nFamously, after months of meditating and busking in Washington Park in Greenwich Village, a chance encounter with a young Brian Eno led to the musician and producer inviting Laraaji to record in London. He went on to develop a sound that suggests the heavy drones of Popul Vuh and Terry Riley\u2019s transcendental minimalism. But Laraaji\u2019s muse has consistently evolved to push further afield of stylistic references.\nLaraaji had moderate commercial success on those early releases, but in the past decade his work has finally received the reception it has deserved, and the video below is a quintessential representation of why: Laraaji possesses an existentially overwhelming presence. Combined with those angelic melodies and chords, his holistic approach to sound and life offers a salve for the pressures of contemporary life.\nRevisit our writeup on Laraaji\u2019sAmbient 3:https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/album/laraaji-ambient-3/"

At the time it was one of the few mainstream outlets that gave airtime to these musical educators, who used it to convey the amazing world of synthesized sound to a larger audience.\nBuchla master Suzanne Ciani\u2019s visit on 3-2-1 Contact is the classic example and the most famous of the bunch: an impressively guided entry point into understanding sound synthesis.We figured we\u2019d have to source all these videos ourselves until we happened upon this really great collection.

Whether it be the topic ofhypnotizing chickens, trying to comprehendPok\u00e9mon Goand whether it involved real human violence and bloodshed or an analytical study ofKanye\u2019s Famous music video, without fault the eccentric filmmaker reveals his singular and completely unique perspective.\nIn light of his most recent video to sweep the mainstream, in which he speaks to Jenkem magazine and discusses how he would soundtrack skateboarding videos toRussian orthodox church choirs, we\u2019d like to dig deeper and break down Herzog\u2019s relationship with music. From the incredible soundtracks of his early classic films and partnership with krautrock band Popul Vuh, to the peculiar music chosen as significant cues in his films, and old and contemporary pieces he cites as influence on his wild and extraordinary mind, here is a look at the musical world of Werner Herzog.\nWerner\u2019s most important musical partnership was with the krautrock legend Florian Fricke of Popol Vuh, who composed the soundtracks to 10 of his films. Florian first met the pianist as an actor in his debut feature 1968\u2019s Signs of Life but sparked a kinship with the composer and exclusively used him for scores beginning with maybe his magnum opus film, Aguirre, Wrath of God.\nWhen talking about music and its use in film, Werner has stated in multiple interviews the importance of a sense of \u201cspace\u201d and using music to build \u201cmystery.\u201d Florian\u2019s spacy ambient and psychedelic leanings as well as his appreciation for epic choral and classical music were perfectly suited for his feverishly fantastical jungle-based epics. He spoke with Red Bull Music Academy regarding the importance of this musical partnership and how Florian brokedown the builds of Wagner operas and being quite blunt about his distaste for New Age music and its \u201cpseudo philosophies.\u201d\n\u201cWe somehow drifted apart,\u201d Herzog said. \u201cHe was going into some sort of a \u2018new age\u2019\u00a0 direction, which I never liked.\u201d We\u2019re not surprised. He is further asked if he liked any of Florian\u2019s associated acts, Can, Neu!, Kraftwerk and his overall feelings on krautrock and so on and he responded that he only knew Florian and that even to this day \u2013 he has no idea what Krautrock is.\nIn summary, a great way to introduce yourself to Werner\u2019s musical world would be to introduce yourself to the music of Florian Fricke, i.e. Popol Vuh.Here are some favorites:\nFrom a single cello playing an overtone to a mass of voices used strictly to overwhelm, Herzog is adamant about music serving the story and its emotional context, but to also serve a meta-objective: creating space. While mostly known for his use of wordless and orchestral melodies to execute this, which works more efficiently, Herzog eventually introduced and experimented with all types of genres.Mubicreated a list of songs used as significant cues in his films to show 5 significant pieces the auteur has used to illustrate this. Here is that list, plus some attached clips so you can listen along:\n\u201cGhetto Raga\u201d used inFata Morgana(1972). By British pysch-folk-prog group Third Ear Band, taken from their 1969 album Alchemy. Third Ear Band would later provide music for Polanski\u2019s 1971 Macbeth.\n\u201cChanterai por mon coraige\u201d used inHeart of Glass(1976).\u00a0 By Guiot de Dijon and performed by Thomas Binkley and the Studio der Fr\u00fchen Musik from their album Chansons der Trouv\u00e8res (1974). Binkley led Studio der Fr\u00fchen Musik from 1960-1980 and founded the Early Music Institute at Indiana University\u2019s School of Music.\n\u201cLost John\u201d by Sonny Terry used inStroszek(1977) andThe Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans(2009). From Terry\u2019s Smithsonian Folkways albumHarmonica and Vocal Solos(1952).\n\u201cTsintskaro\u201d used inNosferatu(1979). Performed by Vocal Ensemble Gordela. From the Melodiya label\u2019s album Georgian Folk Songs (1969). Kate Bush was so moved by Herzog\u2019s use of the music that she would later incorporate it into \u201cHello Earth\u201d on her 1985 albumHounds of Love.\nOpening credits music toWoyzeck(1979).\u00a0 Performed by Fidelquartett Tel\u010d. No further information available. Possibly recorded by Herzog during Woyzeck\u2019s production in Tel\u010d.\nAnother significant source for music in Werner\u2019s films is the dutch cellist Ernst Reijseger, who has soundtracked a number of his recent features and of whom he has said: \u201cHe is a magnificent cellist, and he can do anything, anything on his cello. He could play the civil war, the American Civil War on his cello.\u201d In these recent soundtracks Werner has leaned more on chamber music and the pastoral vocal stylings of Sardinian choirs. Here is a clip of Werner in the studio \u201ccomposing music,\u201d or rather working in a musical role. It\u2019s a small clip instructing Senegalese vocalist Mola Sylla how to sing like he\u2019s lost in space.\nBeyond simply using music as a tool in his films, Herzog also drew inspiration from music. Classical composers obviously had a profound influence on Herzog, though he was also drawn to blues, rock and roll, and world music. Below we\u2019ve included a few artists and pieces that have influenced Herzog\u2019s unique perspective.\nIn the Red Bull Music Academy interview there\u2019s a great story Herzog tells about his newfound obsession with Elvis. Growing up in conservative Munich the 1950s, he was sheltered from American music and had missed the Elvis explosion until the King made his first film,Love Me Tender. He was there opening night and only 20 minutes into the film he watched as all of the young kids \u201cstood up from their seats and quietly, and methodically, demolished the theater. And I thought, this is big!\u201d\nIt\u2019s no surprise that the German filmmaker with a penchant for choirs and operatic drama would be a fan of one of his country\u2019s greatest composers. Herzog has even staged and directed his own productions ofLohengrin,The Flying DutchmanandTannh\u00e4usermultiple times. He recalls the first time ever seeing a Wagner production,Parsifal, in Munich, and describes how the music and a surprise performance shocked him into ripping an entire row of theater seats out of its anchoring.\nHerzog tells a story of discovering Carlo Gesualdo\u2019s Madrgials, which sent him to Popol Vuh\u2019s Florian Fricke\u2019s apartment in the middle of the night, out of his mind, thinking he discovered an \u201centire continent\u201d in his music. Herzog thought Gesualdo was 400 years ahead of his time, and only since Stravinsky have we heard such similar and forward thinking tones in classical music. Positive that he had just discovered a complete unknown, Herzog showed Fricke, who responded: \u201cWerner, everyone into music knows Carlo Gesualdo.\u201d\nDuring the RBMA interview, Herzog was critical of most movie soundtracks for being \u201ctoo cerebral, too many ideas behind them. In only a few instances, it actually fits.\u201d In earnest, he cited Hans Zimmer\u2019s soundtrack for The Lion King as an exception, saying the inclusion of and its clear influence of South African choral music as \u201cphenomenal\u201d and \u201cHollywood at its best.\u201d It was met with surprised laughter from the audience, but Herzog insisted he was serious. \u201cThere\u2019s something so big (in the music)\u2014anyone could see that. It doesn\u2019t take someone like me to recognize that.\u201dWatch the full Red Bull Music Academy interview below:"

        "content": "When Edgar Froese, Conrad Schnitzler, and Klaus Schulze came together as Tangerine Dream in the late 60\u2019s, the first generation of Germans born after World War II were coming of age. The zeitgeist was a feverish desire to create art and music that both reestablished and redefined German culture and their shared humanity. Filmmakers, musicians and visual artists created underground psychedelic societies that resembled the counterculture movement that defined the 60\u2019s globally. Tangerine Dream was born out of that moment in Berlin, and they played what would be called \u201ckrautrock.\u201d What\u2019s curious is krautrock was not a German word. It came from legendary British disc jockey John Peel.\nIn 1974 Tangerine Dream was invited to play the Reims cathedral in France, and they made the most of the unusual opportunity. 3,000 people were expected but 6,000 came; guests including Richard Branson packed in the main hall for what was considered one of the band\u2019s best performances. Unsurprisingly, hippies and the Catholic Church were not particularly a great match. When bishops from the Vatican heard of the kissing and reefer smoking that took place in the pews of the holy site, they were furious and called for re-sanctification of the site. The band was eventually banned from performing at any Roman Catholic church. But when the Coventry Cathedral heard of the scandal, they extended an invitation for Tangerine Dream to perform there. The invitation came just a few weeks after the ban. Since the Coventry Cathedral belonged to The Church of England, it wasn\u2019t beholden to the requests of the pope.\nFurther thickening the plot, the Nazis had destroyed Coventry Cathedral in a blitzkrieg during World War II. Understandably, the band was worried about their reception there. They needn\u2019t have. The show sold out and Tangerine delivered one of the most memorable performances of their career.\nFilmmaker Tony Palmer captured this performance, and the recording finally resurfaced on the web."

The film follows discoveries and advances in sound technology from Edison\u2019s phonograph all the way to surround sound and provides perspective on how sound designers in film and music influenced and inspired each other.\nFor instance, as George Martin introduced stereo phasing in Beatles records, the architect of modern sound design Walter Murch introduced stereo to the silver screen. Murch not only found inspiration inRevolverbut cites New York minimalist John Cage as a major influence on his approach to soundtracking as well as musique concr\u00e8te pioneers Pierre Henry and Pierre Schaffer. Another section shows how Tomita\u2019s quadraphonic albumThe Planetsinspired Francis Ford Coppola to build the first multi-speaker theater system.\nAll in all, the documentary is a beautiful contemplation on sound and fidelity. Although music isn\u2019t the primary focus, it is a lovely adventure in sound perspectives and a must-watch for anyone interested in the history of modern sound design.\nTrailer below.

Alan Greenberg\u2019s directorial debutLand of Look Behindis a beautifully honest and intimate look into the people and culture surrounding reggae music. The film loosely follows the funeral of reggae icon Bob Marley, who was a close friend of Greenberg\u2019s, but ends up being more of a eulogy and love letter to Jamaica and Rastafarian culture. It features some of the most intimate and personal scenes with Rastafarians we\u2019ve ever seen captured on film. Werner Herzog, who worked closely with Greenberg on many projects, has said that \u201cThis film achieves things never seen before in the history of cinema.\u201d\nIf that\u2019s not enough,Land of Look Behindalso includes an incredible \u201cambient reggae\u201d soundtrack by experimental musician K. Leimer along with performances by Gregory Isaacs, Mutabaruka, and a spoken word piece by Father Amde Hamilton of The Watts Prophets.\nThe documentary is available to watch below on YouTube, though we highly recommend tracking down a physical copy to view the film in its full glory.\nListen to K.

        "content": "Unlike virtually everyone else, Kate Bush has achieved success and impact without doing many live shows. The enigmatic artist performed just one concert tour in 1979 before taking an extended hiatus from playing live until 2014. The few concerts she did perform were enormous undertakings combining music, choreography, extensive costume and set changes, and cutting edge technology to an extent that made maintaining her singular vision difficult.\nLuckily, while these performances were few and far between, a wealth of promotional television appearances exist online for fans to dive into the wonderful world of Kate Bush. Here are a few of our favorites:\nWuthering Heights (1978)Let\u2019s start with Kate\u2019s debut single filmed for the Dutch TV program TOPPOP. This video captures Kate at her most expressive with some interesting set design.\nMoving (1978)This was filmed during an exhaustive six month promotional campaign to backThe Kick Inside. Bush was met with open arms in Japan and this performance marked her first in front of a large audience. 11,000 watched this beautiful performance of \u201cMoving\u201d with over 33 million viewers on television. \u201cMoving\u201d would become a huge hit for Bush in Japan.\nThem Heavy People (1978)Another performance from Bush\u2019s first trip to Japan and a very strange one at that. This rendition for a TV program calledSound in Swas recorded variety show style with television personalities taking over vocal duties and Kate jumping in at the end to dance\u2026 Bush probably had very little control over this performance, but it\u2019s pretty fun to watch.\nKashka from Baghdad (1978)This live performance taken from the children\u2019s television programAsk Aspelsees Bush at her most intimate and direct with just solo piano and voice. There\u2019s somehow still a certain magical quality to this performance even without the costumes and sets.\nLooking good feeling fit (1981)Kate breaks down her fitness tips and explains her love for dance while we watch her practice her routine forSat on Your Lapon a BBC show about exercise and nutrition.\nThe Dreaming (1982)Taken fromNa sowas!a German TV show. The producers strangely decided to superimpose a live image of an iguana into the background of the performance, bringing a very odd but also very great spin on the performance. This version is hilariously known as the \u201cGiant Lizard\u201d version."

According to the people at the BBC, I was told they had identified this voice [as someone] who clearly knew what he was talking about. And I did know what I was talking about, I just happened to not be Jamaican and not be black.\u201d\nSince then, Rodigan aka \u201cRoddy, Ram Jam\u201d has become a permanent fixture on UK radio and his shows are listened to around the world, especially in Jamaica.

Once his music caught on, it brought newfound fame and status to his name, long after he had retired from his music career and switched to writing TV jingles and themes. Original copies of his LP started fetching more than $2,000, and his music became widely sampled and beloved in the hip hop community. Some of Verocai\u2019s biggest fans include TV on the Radio, Cut Chemist, DOOM, and Madlib, all of whom attended a historic concert in which Verocai performed works from his debut album for the first time.\nThe night was March 15, 2009, and Verocai assembled a 30-piece orchestra to perform at Cal State University\u2019s Luckman Fine Arts Complex in Los Angeles. Songs from Verocai\u2019s debut album comprised roughly half of the set. Now-Again Records\u2019 founder and president Egon, who hosted the event, recounts, \u201cWatching him on stage was transfixing. He didn\u2019t have to do much; he\u2019d done all the hard work at age 25, when he wrote the original charts that this orchestra, under his watchful eye, played to the note. You got the feeling that he recognized just how important this concert was \u2014 not just for himself, but also for the lucky audience of 1,200.\u201d The day after the concert Cut Chemist texted Egon, \u201cThat was one of the best shows L.A. has ever seen.\u201d\nThe performance was filmed in black and white and released by Mochilla as part of their now sold out DVD box set seriesTimeless: The Composer/Arranger Series, which also includes a Mulatu Astatke concert.

        "content": "Here\u2019s Peter Qvortrup, founder of the respected British gear manufacturer Audio Note, discussing his company\u2019s overarching approach to quality: \u201cI think seeking perfection is a very powerful motivator. I have this strong conviction that music is really very poorly served by the equipment people buy.\u201d\nWhen In Sheep\u2019s Clothing first opened its Arts District doors in 2018, we were driven by similar conviction, one that pushed us to create an unparalleled listening experience in a comfortable room. One of our central components? Audio Note\u2019s Jinro Shochu amplifier. The central aim has always been to create spaces, whether at our current Sound & Vision pop-up at ROW DTLA or our listening events around the city, where music obsessives can gather with friends and colleagues, listen deeply in a group setting on stellar equipment and appreciate the nuances of sound in a way that was both immersive and intimate. To bring this vision to life at our West Hollywood headquarters, we recently once again turned to Qvortrup and his Audio Note team.\nLongtime friends of In Sheep\u2019s Clothing, Audio Note UK have set up a special dedicated listening room at our headquarters in West Hollywood. Earlier this month, we hosted the first intimate night of deep listening to classic albums from the ISC collection and invited guests to bring selections of their own. This exquisite experience was (literally, and precisely) amplified by Audio Note, and this remarkable Audio Note system will remain in our listening room. Expect a future series of talks and sessions in the room. The space will also serve potential buyers interested in demoing the speakers.\nTo amplify the philosophy and passion behind the company, which was founded in 1991, we sat down with Qvortrup and his AN colleague Adrian Ford-Crush. Qvortrup shared insights on everything from the impact of the pandemic on music listening habits to the unique qualities of Audio Note\u2019s products. His obsession with creating the ultimate listening experience is evident in every thought. The below transcript of our chat, which has been edited for length and clarity, touches on the nuances of high-fidelity sound, the evolution of audio technology and the future of immersive listening.\nRandall Roberts:So I started really developing a sense of listening on a nice system during the pandemic, and I\u2019m not alone. It allowed many people with the time and space to listen to \u2014 and hear \u2014 music in a different way. I\u2019m wondering whether in your experience, there\u2019s anything that separates this moment in time in the listening and hi-fidelity spheres and whether you feel like the pandemic changed anything for you?\nPeter Qvortrup:The pandemic has been a major game changer in a number of areas. I mean, behavioral mental health has definitely been affected by it. We saw an enormous increase in orders towards the end of the lockdown period, where people were really sitting at home. They weren\u2019t going on holiday. They were accumulating money in their bank accounts, and they were looking for something to spend it on. Quite a lot of them spent it on stereo equipment. So I think certainly the parts of the world where people were furloughed, and they sat at home and didn\u2019t work for 8, 12, 16 weeks or however long, I think there was definitely a marked increase in both sales but also people spending time in front of their stereo equipment. I know for a fact that I\u2019ve got a friend who\u2019s got a big record store in London, and he said that their online sales literally exploded, they couldn\u2019t get anywhere near what they were taking orders from.\nRR: Has that continued? Or was that a blip?\nPQ: It\u2019s definitely tailed off. I mean, it\u2019s funny because I sat and looked at the sales figures, and 2021 the sales of our products, the inflow of orders increased by well over 100%. And then it\u2019s been dropping off. 2022 was a little bit worse, 2023 was a little bit worse, and 2024 is now beginning to look like it might be picking up again.\nAdrian Ford-Crush: That\u2019s kind of returning to trend.\nPQ: I would say what\u2019s probably happened is that people have moved forward purchases that they would have done in 2023. That creates this sort of blip in sales. But whether the younger generation has bought on the same basis, I don\u2019t really know. What I do know is that I was at the London show this weekend. And there was a surprising number of people under 40s. And we went toAXPONA, and there was quite a reasonable number of young people there as well. That\u2019s the big show. On the other hand, the Tampa show, I would say the average age was 75.\nRR: The lines during Record Store Day in America are filled with Millennials and Gen Zers. So many young people buying records \u2014 and buying used records, interesting records. You would hope that means they\u2019re aware that the best way to listen to that is with a system.\nPQ: I agree with that. I think if you look at the 1950s, the people that were buying LPs in those days were the professional classes and people with money, i.e., people with a decent income. An LP in 1955 or 56 cost the same as a bus driver made in a week after tax. So you didn\u2019t get a lot of bus drivers buying LPs every week because they couldn\u2019t afford it. And if you take one of the more extreme examples, there was a set of records that came out in 1951 called Mozart Matins de Paris. It was released by a record company called The Discovery Fonset in France. That record cost the same as a surgeon made in a month, which also explains why they\u2019re so rare now.\nRR: Did you get your start listening to classical music?\nPQ: My father listened to classical music as a child, and it sort of carries over from that when you grow up with it. Pretty much anything and everything. I mean, if you go on YouTube and Google my name or Audio Note, you\u2019ll find quite a lot of stuff where we play heavy metal and thrash metal and psytrance and nightclub music and all sorts of other stuff. So you can pretty much do everything. But the percentage of the population that buys products like ours is relatively small.\nAnd it\u2019s not just the price issue. It\u2019s also the fact that you have to have a very specific interest in music and collecting music. It has to be a sort of central part of your quality of life, if you will. And I think that\u2019s always been the case. The people that can\u2019t afford to buy these, they go on and learn to play the piano, or the guitar or whatever. Before Edison invented the recordings, all the great arias were sung by the gondoliers in Venice. And by the way, I don\u2019t know whether you\u2019ve ever been to Milan, to La Scala, the opera house there. But at the back of the hall, you can get in for not a lot of money. And that\u2019s where the people that don\u2019t have a high income, but like opera and classical music in general, can buy tickets. I think when I went there once, and it\u2019s really tiring to stand there for a long opera, because you can\u2019t sit down, but it was very democratic in the sense that they allowed the part of the population to go in and listen to these great pieces of music.\nRR: I\u2019m curious, your products are cost-prohibitive to many people. Like you\u2019ve said, unless you\u2019re willing to cut corners elsewhere and not go on vacation, it\u2019s hard for many younger people to afford a high-quality system. Is that a business decision, or because quality gear is expensive to make?\nPQ: No, I would love to make something cheaper. It\u2019s just what I\u2019ve discovered over the 45 years I\u2019ve been doing this is that there is a lower limit, which is very difficult to break through. To make something that gives a fair representation of the software that you\u2019re playing, it really cannot be made much cheaper than our lowest priced products. A basic CD player with an amplifier and a pair of speakers and some relatively inexpensive cables, you\u2019re still looking at about $12,000. Of course, you can buy products that are made in Taiwan, or China, or wherever, but they don\u2019t really represent the music very well. And it doesn\u2019t mean that people shouldn\u2019t buy them, it just means that there\u2019s a limit to how you retain your interest in music. If the system doesn\u2019t do a good job, you don\u2019t spend as much time in front of the stereo equipment as you might want to under ideal circumstances.\nRR: Can you talk about the systems that you\u2019ve helped set up for In Sheep\u2019s Clothing?\nPQ: All of the equipment we make is tube-based. We don\u2019t use any transistors in anything. So they\u2019ve got an integrated amplifier called a Meishu. They\u2019ve got our TT-3 turntable, which is a suspended three-motor turntable. It\u2019s quite a striking design. They have a CD 4.1x player, and then they have AN-E speakers, which are our larger full-range speakers. A very nice system to get down.\nRR: I\u2019d like to read you a quote that you said one time. You said, \u201cI started to realize probably 20 years ago that I can instantly recognize when I think something is better. And it\u2019s very rare that I\u2019m wrong.\u201d Can you talk about the most recent audio-related experience that stands out to you?\nPQ: We developed a speaker using electromagnets. So when I heard the first pair of those, which is a couple of years ago now, the very early prototypes, I mean, it was, you know, we talk about a Damascus Road experience kind of thing. And this was one a confirmation of what I hoped would happen, or what I hoped I\u2019d hear. It was also revelatory in the sense that it was just so much better than what I had, which were more than twice the price of my system at home. And, you know, that kind of experience, I\u2019ve had quite a few of those over the years. But we\u2019ve spent a lot of time and money developing things with this specific target to make them do something that we hadn\u2019t heard before. The deeper that persistence digs into the software, the more you hear of the actual original event, whether it\u2019s a construction in a studio, or whether it\u2019s a live event. In most cases, the live events have a little bit more, what do we say, interesting information in them. But it\u2019s not always the case. There are studio recordings that do a very good job of this.\nWhat\u2019s particularly interesting is, for me at least, I started listening to a friend in Russia who did some very good transfers from 78s, mainly classical music. The sound of those as the equipment has gotten better over time, as we\u2019ve improved the D to A converters and the CD transports and so on, what\u2019s becoming obvious is that there is something in these recordings that we don\u2019t get from modern recordings. There\u2019s a kind of authenticity or life to the performance.\nWe are very obsessed. I can recommend a book that talks about this more generally, the science and so on. It\u2019s calledVoltaire\u2019s Bastards. The subtitle isThe Dictatorship of Reason in the West. We have this sort of idea in the West that with pure reasoning and logic, you can think something through and arrive at the right conclusion. Most of our societies are based on this idea, that if we think this through properly, we will end up with the right conclusion. One of the problems as a society that we have now is that this is clearly not working. You\u2019ve been a journalist, so you should be more than familiar with this particular concept. But the 78 RPM records, one of the things we realized just before COVID was that when we use the 78 transfers on a CDR, it\u2019s actually easier in many respects to hear the differences, whether something is better or worse, when you do a comparison.\nI\u2019ve been thinking about this a great deal over the last seven, eight years, after we started realizing that this was the case. The only couple of things I can really think about is in the 1930s, 1920s, 1910s, the 78 RPM transfers had a very short distance between the actual performance and laying down the software. To take an acoustic 78, there might be a couple of meters between the singer, the piano, or whatever it was you\u2019re recording, and the needle that cuts the software. And yes, there are issues with coloration, noise, and so on. But there is something tangible sitting in these recordings that we don\u2019t seem to be able to capture the same way with all our advanced technology and our microphones and our digital workstations and so on. And I will probably spend the rest of my days trying to figure out how to explain this.\nRR: Yes.\nPQ: I think one of my big takeaways with audio and the audio manufacturing industry as a whole is that they completely disregard the music that\u2019s on 78s because it\u2019s cosmetically aged, noisy, and there are bandwidth issues and some phase problems. But at the end of the day, 50, maybe 60% of the greatest classical performances sit on 78s.\nRR: Right, right.\nPQ: The same applies to jazz. And if you look at blues, for example, it\u2019s even worse. It\u2019s like 90% of the greatest blues sits on 78s. There are the recordings with Leadbelly and Blind Lemon Jefferson and all these old blues artists. All of that is on 78s.\nRR: And Enrico Caruso\u2019s stuff is on wax cylinder.\nPQ: Some of it\u2019s on wax cylinder. He died in 1921. I mean, I\u2019ve got several things that he recorded during the First World War.\nRR: I did a story on wax cylinder collectors and a wax cylinder repair person in Los Angeles. Amazing guy. He is a dentist actually. It\u2019s a long story, but he\u2019s a dentist who in his nighttime hours uses the same tools during his daytime hours to repair wax cylinders. He found that the same adhesives used for your teeth work really well on wax cylinders.\nPQ: The problem with the wax cylinder is that they harden over time. Even if you can repair them, actually repairing them may not solve the problem. I saw a TV program with a talk show host, and he was showing\u2026 It wasn\u2019t too long ago. He said something like, \u201cThis is the only known one.\u201d And then he takes it and literally, I think he just grabbed it too hard, and it literally disintegrated.\nOne of the reasons why they went away from wax cylinders was that they were too fragile. They knew this already in the 1890s. This is how we ended up with the flat disc. And of course, a lot of people who write to me say, \u201cWell, you know, replaying a flat disc is a lot more difficult because the distance that is traveled on the outside is much longer than on the inside and that means it\u2019ll compress the data and it\u2019ll do all sorts of things.\u201d All of which is true. But I don\u2019t think we would have anything like the catalog that we have available to us now if everything was on cylinders.\nRR: More difficult to store too.\nPQ: When Edison invented it, he didn\u2019t do it to record music. They did it so someone would read a letter to somebody, and the secretary would then take a cylinder and type it. So you didn\u2019t need stenographers to sit there and write. It was not done as a data file. The idea was never that it was supposed to record symphony orchestras.\nRR: I could talk on and on about this topic. Can we jump ahead to the future? What\u2019s your experience with the new formats like 3D immersive listening and spatial audio? Have you experienced that much? What are your thoughts?\nPQ: It is nonsense, to be perfectly honest. It was tried already; quadrophonic recordings came out in the 1970s. One, they didn\u2019t sound much good, and it was very difficult to get a cartridge to track them. And of course, we can solve that, which is an audio bug again. Why would you want to do that? And all this idea that it has to be immersive\u2026 immersive what? I can get very immersed sitting listening to an old recording of Debussy in my car on my way to my house in France. That immerses me perfectly. I don\u2019t need\u2026 It\u2019s all crap. Again, it\u2019s a little bit like, there\u2019s a boundary, I think, that they are constantly trying to bypass, and it really doesn\u2019t do anything to the experience. It might make the engineers or developers very excited about it, and the idiots that sell it just as excited about it. But at the end of the day, there really isn\u2019t much to get excited about. Well-recorded music reproduced on two speakers, that\u2019s about as far as it goes. All of this other stuff is just marketing hype as far as I\u2019m concerned. No, sorry to be a Luddite.\nAFC: Oh, no, no, that\u2019s my question.\nPQ: I just don\u2019t see it having any relevance at all to the musical experience.\nNote: For those interested in listening to the Audio Note system at our headquarters, send an email to[email\u00a0protected]"

        "content": "Are you considering a turntable upgrade in 2024? Before you empty your wallet on a deck that might seem like the right path for you \u2014 we have a few suggestions that might make more sense long-term if your budget is between $600 and $2,000.\nThere are so many turntable options available right that it has become rather confusing for both experienced audiophiles and music listeners who have only recently jumped aboard the vinyl train.\nChoice is great. But that doesn\u2019t mean that dropping $5,000 on your first turntable makes any sense.\nMost of your investment needs to be in the music. Don\u2019t be one of those people with a super expensive deck and 30 audiophile pressings.\nShould you spend more on the turntable or cartridge?\nInvesting more in a better table will pay off long-term and you can always upgrade your cartridge at a later date. We have some excellent suggestions below $500 that are proven performers.\nShould you always go with a new deck or can a restored vintage turntable also deliver excellent sonic results?\nI have used three restored Thorens turntables fromVinyl Nirvanaover the past decade and whilst the return on investment has been excellent \u2014 none of these options were inexpensive when you factored in the custom hardwood plinths, tonearms, and associated cartridges.\nThe minimum investment in one of these turntables is around $1,800 USD.\nThe build quality on all of these turntables that were originally made in the 1970s is excellent and there have been zero issues with reliability or parts \u2014 Dave Archambault has enough to last many years of service.\nBut for most people \u2014 a new turntable probably makes the most sense.\nThere is a lot of competition below $600 and I was fortunate last year to try a number from Rega, Pro-Ject, Fluance, and Andover Audio. The level of performance that can be squeezed out of an entry-level deck is surprising, but for most people \u2014 they just want to set it up and listen.\nI wasn\u2019t really blown away by theSpinDeckbut theSpinDeck Maxis a completely different table that is manufactured in Germany for Andover. The automatic design just feels more substantial and it\u2019s built to a much higher standard; which includes the tonearm and rather beefy platter.\nThe supplied Ortofon OM10 is fine but I swapped it out for aGrado Prestige Red3which just sounds fuller and less bright in my office system. The SpinDeck Max is not a fancy deck but it comes across as slightly more authoritative sounding with excellent pace in most systems. It can also be tweaked with a cork platter fromAnalog Restorationsand certainly benefits from some isolation. You might be surprised at what this deck can do with a better cartridge andphono preamplifier.\nWhere to buy:$599$399at\u00a0andoveraudio.com|Amazon\nHaving spent three months with theDebut Prowhich proved to be one of my favorite products of 2022, I\u2019m more than confident to recommend it to anyone in the $1,000 range. Inflation has pushed everything higher but I\u2019d still spend the extra money on this one.\nHaving compared the Debut Pro to all 6 tables that I have at home which includes the aforementionedThorens decks, aNAD C 588,Yamaha YP-701, and a mystery deck that is currently under review \u2014 the Debut Pro is an excellent deck that can be tweaked to a very high level of performance. Consider this to be the best currently available under $1,000.\nPro-Ject has the ability to manufacture almost anything and the new tonearm and very inert platter elevate this table in a very substantial way; it sounds far more forceful and dynamic compared to theDebut EVOtables that lack some bottom end weight and presence in comparison.\nThe supplied Sumiko cartridge works well but swapping that out for theSumiko WellfleetorBlue Point No. 3is a very worthwhile upgrade.\nRead my Pro-Ject Debut Pro review hereorwatch our video review here.\nWhere to buy:$999at Amazon|Crutchfield|Turntable Lab\nThe little engine that could is tucked away in a suburb outside of Boston, and after almost 10 years old it is hard not to be impressed by what Ben Carter and the folks atU-Turn Audiohave accomplished.\nThe newU-Turn Audio Orbit Theory Turntableis a huge milestone for the company that has focused on the market below $400 for most of their existence.\nWhen I visited the company almost 7 years ago, it was impossible not to notice that they were struggling with the sheer volume of orders and that they needed to find better domestic sources for their platters, plinths, and motors.\nCarter and I discussed the rationale for the price structure of their tables and the possibility of manufacturing something in the $700 USD range.\nThere was already the desire to make something like the Orbit Theory and take on Rega and Pro-Ject, but that required more capital, employees, and the ability to create a tonearm that would be a major upgrade over the tonearm on the existing Orbit.\nThe new U-Turn Audio Orbit Theory is $999 USD \u2014 you can also order a version with their internal phono stage for $1,069.\nThe focus with the new Orbit Theory is clearly on the tonearm, motor, and construction of the plinth.\nFor the Theory Orbit turntable, U-Turn decided that they needed to take their OA2 gimbal bearing design to the next level by further reducing points of resonance in the tonearm. Practically speaking, this meant using more rigid materials and minimizing the number of connection points between parts.\nThe new motor and pulley are so quiet that they can be mounted directly to the plinth, ensuring perfect belt alignment. The motor is electronically controlled by a DC-powered sine wave generator \u2013 this provides very stable platter speed and gives you the ability to change between 33/45 RPM with the turn of a knob.\nTheory\u2019s acrylic platter is frosted, and all of platter surfaces have been precision machined for maximal flatness and minimal runout. They have also machined a groove into the platter to keep the belt in place.\nWhat better way to celebrate a new turntable than with a new finish? For Theory, U-Turn decided to do real hardwood plinths, but wanted to spice things up a bit. Ebonization is a traditional finishing process that turns wood black without staining or painting.\nHow does it sound?\nBold. Precise. Far more substantial than any of the decks they have produced before and with excellent tonal weight and speed.\nWhere to buy:$999at uturnaudio.com\nTechnics has been very aggressive during the vinyl revolution introducing a number of new models that have sold out in some markets within weeks. The brand has a proven track record with both DJs and audiophiles and even itstop models that sell for more than $3,000 USDhave continued to sell well.\nThe SL-1500C sits in the middle of the Technics product lineup and hasbeen available since 2019. However, looks like it isn\u2019t going away anytime soon as Technics, instead of offering to replace it has decided to offer a new color option in addition to the standard silver and black,the SL-1500C will also be available inmatte white (SL-1500C-W).\nWith its minimalistic look, the SL-1500C-W is designed for great performance and ease of use supported by the following key features.\nThe SL-1500C-W incorporates acoreless direct drive brushless DC motor. This allows for a stable rotation that is free from \u201ccogging.\u201d\nThe two-layer platter provides improved vibration-damping performance.\nThe highly sensitive S-shaped aluminum tonearm accurately reads record grooves; an S-Shaped tonearm has an equal mass on both sides of its pivot point.\nIn addition to its S-shape the tone features Auto-lift. This minimizes needle wear-out and preserves records.\nThe SL-1500C-W has a high-rigidity cabinet and a high-damping insulator for the thorough shut-out of vibrations. This ensures smooth tracking.\nWhat makes this deck unique?\nFantastic speed stability, combined with rather rugged construction and a solid tonearm make it a reliable platform for a wide range of cartridges. We\u2019ve listened to this range of decks with Ortofon, Hana, Grado, and Golding cartridges and you might be surprised how well it performs with $750 to $2,000 cartridges. It also elevates the performance of less expensive cartridges making it a great platform that you can upgrade over time.\nWhere to buy:$1,299at Crutchfieldin black (SL-1500C-K), silver (SL-1500C-S), or white (SL-1500C-W)\nRega\u2019s iconic turntables have been in production for 50 years and would make any credible list of high-end audio components that have changed the industry. Rega has also sold hundreds of thousands of tonearms over the past 5 decades; audiophiles have purchased OEM versions of its tonearms from a number of brands including Michell, Origin Live, Moth Audio, and Goldring.\nIn 1977, Rega introduced the Planar 2 and Planar 3 turntables, which were an evolution of the Planet turntable. The Planar 3 was designed to be a higher-end version of the Planar 2, with better build quality and performance.\nThe Planar 3 had a glass platter, a low-noise motor, and a new tonearm. The new Rega-Acos R200 tonearm was a radical departure from the standard tonearms of the time.\nIt was a lightweight design that used a unipivot bearing, which allowed it to track the record groove more accurately. The Planar 3 was an instant success and quickly gained a reputation for its excellent sound quality and value for money.\nOver the years, Rega has continued to refine and improve the Planar 3 turntable. In 1983, they introduced the RB300 tonearm, which was a significant upgrade over the original tonearm. The RB300 used a more rigid tube and a more advanced bearing system, which improved tracking accuracy and reduced distortion.\nIn 1991, Rega introduced the P3 turntable, which was an updated version of the Planar 3 with a new motor, platter, and tonearm. In 2000, Rega introduced the P3-24, which had a new 24-volt motor and a new plinth design.\nIn 2016, Rega introduced a new version of the Planar 3, which had a new RB330 tonearm, a new plinth design, and improved motor control circuitry.\nAvailable in the hugely popular new walnut effect finish, the 50th anniversary Planar 3 is supplied with a hand tunedNeo PSU MK2and the handmade RegaExact moving magnet cartridgefactory fitted.\nFor those looking to upgrade this Planar 3, there is a new cartridge option just released by Rega at High End Munich 2024 that looks like a big upgrade over the Exact.\nAccording to Rega, theNd3will offer between 5 and 6mV of output (which feels somewhat ambiguous) and requires 1.75 grams of tracking force. The headshell uses 3 points for attachment making it ideal for Rega\u2019s own tonearms.\nEachNd3is hand-made by Rega\u2019s skilled technicians in the UK factory. The design uses brand new generator geometry with perfect symmetry to achieve highly accurate channel balance. TheNd3also has an optimized pole gap for superior linearity and cross talk characteristics.\nThe complete assembly is housed in a zero tolerance Injection moulded glass filled polyphenylene sulphide body (PPS) which is a lightweight and highly rigid material. A low mass body reduces stress on the tonearm bearings and aids free movement which is critical in accurate vinyl replay.\nThis new body design was inspired by Rega\u2019s existing range of MC cartridges.\nThe drive system uses theirreference drive beltand a custom CNC\u2019d aluminium drive pulley to deliver the absolute best in performance and accuracy.\nThe Anniversary Edition is completed with an aluminium lid plinth badge and smoked dustcover to complete the Anniversary Edition.\nWhat makes this deck special?\nIf you put enormous value on tempo, clarity, detail, and a very open sounding presentation \u2014 the Rega is very hard to beat.\nThe expressive nature of this deck is second-to-none at the price.\nWhere to buy:$1,695at Music Direct(limited availability)\nTip: The regular Planar 3 (without cartridge) starts at$1,125at Turntable LabandAudio Advice\nDoes balanced really make a difference?\nMy experience suggests that it does if you have to contend with certain noise issues.\nAlmost 22 years ago, I invested in a very expensive turntable and felt that I had reachedvinyl nirvana. I paid a professional $200 to properly install the cartridge, setup the table which had a finicky suspension system, and help me mount the turntable shelf to the wall.\nMy building at the time was a pre-war in downtown Toronto that needed an upgrade on the electrical front. Noisy to say the least.\nNo matter what I tried, my turntable setup always sounded noisy; ground loop issues, constant hiss, and it became a a source of depression (first world problems). Why bother spending almost $8,000 on such a system if it sounded terrible.\nA local dealer suggested that I have my arm and table modified so that I could run a fully balanced rig; which also included upgrading to a balanced phono stage. I sold a few other items to facilitate the changes.\nExtreme? Perhaps.\nBut when I listened to the same records that mattered to me \u2014 I was stunned by the differences in clarity, noise floor, and overall dynamics of the sound.\nDoes a balanced setup always sound better? Not necessarily and I\u2019m not convinced that every manufacturer who markets \u201cbalanced\u201d is really offering that.\nThePro-Ject X2 Boffers both single-ended and balanced connection options, but you do need to use an MC cartridge for a balanced setup.\nIs there a huge gap between theDebut PROand the X2 B? Fair question.\nIf running the same MM cartridge like aSumiko Wellfleet, I would still give the edge to the X2 B when it comes to impact and overall resolution, but the gap isn\u2019t enormous.\nHowever, when running aMC cartridgeinto one of the Pro-Ject balanced phono pre-amplifiers or something like theMoon by Simaudio 610LP\u2014 the gap between the two tables is rather enormous.\nThe clarity, bass impact, soundstage depth and width, and overall dynamics of the system totally changes.\nThe Pro-Ject X2 B goes from being a very good $1,799 turntable to a rather exceptional table that can compete with some tables in the $2,500 to $3,000 range and I\u2019ve heard enough $3,000 tables to know.Read my in-depth review here.\nWhere to buy:$1,599at Crutchfield|Turntable Lab\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission."

        "title": "DownBeat: An Intimate Jazz Kissa in Yokohama",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/downbeat-yokohama/",
        "content": "Featured in Philip Arneill\u2019sTokyo Jazz Jointsbook, DownBeat is one of the classic jazz kissas located in the historical port side block neighborhood of Yokohama\u2019s bar district Noge. Like many post-war establishments in Yokohama, which is known as the birthplace of jazz in Japan, DownBeat first became popular by catering to American soldiers working at U.S. military facilities around the city. The original space hosted live jazz nights performed mostly by American soldiers that soon became frequented by Japanese residents who admired the music for its sense of freedom.\nAfter relocating in 1968, DownBeat has since focused more on their vinyl collection, which traces the history of modern jazz from the swing and bebop era in the \u201950s all the way to contemporary jazz. The 3000+ vinyl collection includes albums from famous American labels such as Blue Note, Impulse, and Prestige, European labels such as ECM, MPS, and ENJA, along with contemporary records from around the world. \u201cAfter decades of repeated use, the jackets are worn and peeling\u2026 [the current owner] Mr. Yoshihisa combines the tattered records with current new releases to create the atmosphere of the store with a \u2018Downbeat-like\u2019 selection of music.\u201d\nA small and intimate space, DownBeat seats around 20-30 people with lounge style seating and minimal, moody lighting. Music is clearly the intention at this establishment, and the sound has been noted to be so loud that conversation can be difficult (amazing). The sound system itself is quite classic for jazz kissas from this era and features a Sony direct drive turntable, Shure V15 cartridge, Accuphase amplifier, and Altec A7 Voice of Theater loudspeakers. A cloud-shaped acoustic panel is attached to the ceiling, and covered with clippings from the Down Beat magazine. Oil paintings of Art Blakey, Oscar Peterson, Sonny Rollins, Miles Davis, and other legends line the walls. \u201cSmoked by cigarette smoke, they are now more like tar paintings than oil paintings, which makes them even more valuable.\u201d\nIn recent years, DownBeat has become even more popular, bringing in a younger generation of fans. Niew Media\u2019s Mitsutaka Nagira writes, \u201cWhy is such a long-established store attracting attention now? The answer lies in the presence of Shuhei Yoshihisa, who now runs the store as the owner. Downbeat, which has been in business for 68 years this year, was run by its first owner, Hayato Anbo, until the 1990s. When Mr. Yasuho passed away, Kohei Tanaka, a long-time regular customer, took over the business to ensure its survival. Later, when Mr. Tanaka, the second-generation owner, decided to let the restaurant go, the current owner, Mr. Yoshihisa, who became the young owner in his 30s, was also a regular customer who had been coming to Downbeat since his student days. In other words, Downbeat is a jazz cafe that has been preserved by regulars who know the atmosphere and music selection trends. It\u2019s easy to see how the atmosphere has been preserved by the three owners over its long history. It is not only about the time-traveling space. The most important point lies in its music selection.\u201d\nPurchase the latestJazz Kissa 2022-2023by Katsumasa Kusunose:https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/product/katsumasa-kusunose-jazz-kissa-2022-2023-book/"

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/jazz-cafe-chigasu/",
        "content": "Founded in 1933 by a 20-year old jazz lover named Mamoru Yoshida, Jazz Cafe Chigusa in Yokohama has long held the title of the oldest standing jazz kissa in Japan. One of the first of its kind to open at the dawn of Japanese jazz in the \u201930s when kissa culture was just beginning, Chigusa (which translates to \u201cAutumn Leaves\u201d) remains a historic cultural landmark that has miraculously survived over the decades through multiple wars and re-developments. Listed on their website, Chigusa\u2019s mission is \u201cto inherit and promote jazz culture by overcoming many hardships.\u201d\nThe cafe has been closed and rebuilt a number of times, including during World War II when the building and 6,000 records were destroyed in the Yokohama air raid. After Chigusa\u2019s destruction, Yoshida returned from military service in 1947, collected over 1,000 more records, and restarted Chigasu. The jazz cafe would later close once again in 2007 when the second location had to be sold to developers. In 2012, a group of long-time fans and locals led by regular Masataka Yusare successfully resurrected Chigusa close to where it was originally opened in 1933 by Yoshida, who died in 1994 aged 81. For the past few years, Chigusa has been under reconstruction and slated to be re-opened in 2024 as \u201cJazz Museum Chigusa.\u201d\nThe spirit of Chigusa lives on over the decades through the lasting impact of founder Mamoru Yoshida, who grew up around U.S. military bases in Yokohama and fell in love with jazz while enjoying the sounds of Toshiko Akiyoshi, Sadao Watanabe, and Terumasa Hino at clubs. He devoted himself completely to studying jazz and would apparently spend 30 to 40% of his salary on importing records from the United States. The music in the collection ranges from old-time swing to \u201980s fusion and modern, experimental jazz. Photos of legends like Duke Ellington, Charles Mingus, Wayne Shorter, Ron Carter, Mal Waldron, Thelonious Monk, Joe Zawinul, and others line the walls along with numerous signed autographs from esteemed visitors. It is said that famous musicians would often visit Chigusa to listen and even take advice from Yoshida, who was renowned across Japan for his deep understanding of jazz.\nBelow, watch a calming tribute video (shot in 2022 shortly before the last location had to be closed) that perfectly captures the feeling of stepping into Chigusa during a cloudy afternoon, drinking coffee, and listening to jazz records on the massive custom-built soundsystem."

        "content": "Despite being more than a half-century old, the information delivered in Introduction to Hi-Fi, a 1960 book on the basics of sound reproduction and high fidelity listening at home, remains relevant to anyone looking to better understand the magic behind great stereophonic sound. In it, British writer Clement Brown explains in simple, everyday language the way stuff works. He moves from amplifier to cartridge to speaker and beyond, writing about the mechanics of audio reproduction and essential information for the stereo-curious to absorb. The goal: Providing information that allows you to get the most out of your records.\nIs it the most entertaining writing you\u2019ve ever encountered? Nope. It\u2019s quite dry, very staid, and written not to spark joy but convey info. As he writes in the intro:\nThis book has been written by a music-lover who hopes that his contribution to the cause of high quality sound reproduction will encourage others to take an interest in it. The author has concentrated on guidance and information which an association with both musicians and engineers has shown to be of practical value when considering the possibility of good sound in the home. The depth of one\u2019s pocket has not been overlooked in describing the desirable features of high fidelity equipment for reproduction from records, tape and radio.\nAvailable on the fantastic archival magazine siteWorldRadioHistory, the book offers perspective for a few different types of readers, most notably the kind of listener, writes Brown, \u201cwho has little opportunity or inclination to attend concerts. We need not be surprised at the size of this group when we consider the vast repertoire of recordings available for playing at home and the many hours of broadcasting each day.\u201d\nSixty-four years later, an infinite number of online broadcasting hours occurs each day, but the truth remains that for the concert-starved outside of major entertainment centers, deep listening on hi-fi systems fills a deep need.\nBrown begins with some very simple stuff that bears repeating:\n\u201cFirst, it should be clearly understood that high fidelity results are not likely to be obtained from a single unit of furniture. Much is sacrificed when the loudspeaker is mounted in the same cabinet as other, equally vital parts, and the novice should remember that a separately housed loudspeaker is a fundamental requirement. This means a minimum of two pieces of furniture. With the wide range of elegant and often inexpensive cabinets now available, however, there should be no difficulty in finding an arrangement to meet individual tastes. Secondly, most of the components of a high fidelity installation \u2014 amplifiers, pick-ups, loudspeakers and so on \u2014 are sold separately for the enthusiast to incorporate in his own installation.\u201d\nHe defines sound in a precisely conveyed paragraph:\nSound is the effect on the ear of variations in air pressure. It can travel in various mediums, but we are concerned only with its propagation in air, in which it has avelocity of 1,100 ft. per second (approximately). The pressure variations are caused by an object vibrating and subjecting the surrounding air to alternate compression and rarefaction. The air particles are thus agitated backwards and forwards in the path of what we call the sound wave.\nA perfect scroll-through time-passer for those on jury duty, in waiting rooms, or chilling on a Monday night, you\u2019ll exit this book knowing a lot more about hi-fi systems and strategies for improving the sound in your life.\nTo get a better sense of the knowledge available in Intro to Hi-Fi, here\u2019s an index page.\nReadIntroduction to Hi-Fiby Clement Brownhere."

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/varia-instruments/",
        "content": "Speaking with ISC from his workshop in Berne, Switzerland, Varia Instruments co-founder Simon Sch\u00e4r is beaming with energy. After a 10-hour day assembling various mechanical components, stress-testing electrical parts, welding cylinders, and fulfilling a long-waiting list of international orders, the telltale signs of fatigue are nowhere to be found in Simon\u2019s lively demeanor. Before the interview gets underway, Simon takes me on a virtual tour of the workshop. He introduces me to his coworkers, explaining the different assembly processes and protocols, and excitedly shows off the newest addition to the Varia Instruments breakroom: a recently completed DJ booth built from scratch by one of Simon\u2019s friends.\nFor the past 9 years, Simon and his business partner, Marcel Schneider, have been building some of the finest rotary DJ mixers on the market: the 2-channel RDM20 and the 4-channel RDM40. In addition to the two mixers, Varia Instruments offers the TTW10 \u2013 a hand cut, precision turntable weight that doubles as a 45 adapter. From concept to completion, all of Varia Instruments\u2019 products are hand-built and carefully assembled by a small team of engineers and music lovers in Marcel and Simon\u2019s hometown of Berne.\nVaria Instruments products are praised for their sleek design, stout durability, range of features, and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 their excellent and robust sound quality. Louie Vega, Jeff Mills, Gerd Janson, and Osunlade are just a few of the many DJs who have offered glowing reviews of Varia Instruments\u2019 high-end audio gear. Lucky for us, Varia Instruments\u2019 RDM20 has also found a home with ISC at our listening bar in New York City.\nMy interview with Simon came to fruition after receiving a DM from the Varia Instruments Instagram account inquiring about a photo I shot of the RDM40. Shortly after, Simon and I began exchanging messages, sharing mixes, sending photos of records we love, and chatting about music. Eventually Simon set aside time from his busy schedule to speak with In Sheep\u2019s Clothing about the origins of Varia Instruments, the similarities and differences of analog culture around the world, and the challenges and rewards of building a business with passion. The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\nAndrew Lowell (In Sheep\u2019s Clothing): Let\u2019s start from the beginning. What were the origins of Varia Instruments. How did it all start?\nSimon Sch\u00e4r: Well, really Varia Instruments was born out of a huge coincidence. It almost felt like it was meant to be. I\u2019ve been DJing for half of my life \u2013 17 years ago now \u2013 and you know, you make this development when you first start DJing. First you get records from the flea markets, then you discover Discogs and record stores. And the same development occurs with the equipment. I started with a shitty Hitachi turntable, and at a certain point I bought another turntable, and slowly I built my setup until eventually I managed to have two proper DJ turntables, some speakers that were given to me by my dad and I was truly satisfied with everything but the mixer. I used to have an old Vestax PMC 05 Pro 2, which is really a hiphop battle mixer, before I got a Vestax PMC25 with an isolator on it. But I was never really happy with the quality or the features. There were things that were missing or not nicely done. So I began searching for the right mixer, which was sort of an endeavor. The quality wasn\u2019t good enough, or some features were missing, or it was too expensive, or I had no chance to test it.\nAL: What were some of the features that you felt were missing?\nSS:In particular, I really wanted to have a full isolator on the channel, not only an EQ. And it had to be three bands: bass, middle and treble \u2013 not only bass and treble. I also wanted to have a cue mix, which wasn\u2019t available on all mixers. At the time, there wasn\u2019t really a DJ mixer out there with isolators on each channel. I couldn\u2019t find a single model. Nowadays, a few other brands are doing it, but I think Varia is one of the first companies that somehow came up with that feature.\nSo as I was going through this search, I began speaking with friends and fellow DJs until eventually I spoke with my friend Marc who suggested that I reach out to someone named \u201cMarcel\u201d who made a prototype of some sort of DJ mixer. And I was like, \u201cWait a second, who is Marcel? I don\u2019t know this guy.\u201d Imagine, there was a person in the same town, at the same time, doing this very particular thing I was looking for. When I called him, he was very open to meeting and showing me his creation.\nAL: This was in 2015?\nSS:Yes, November 2015. Marcel invited me over to his place to check out the prototype and I went there with a list \u2013 like literally, I wrote out a list of all of the features I wanted in my dream mixer and when I first saw Marcel\u2019s prototype, it checked every single box on my list. The isolator on the channel, the master isolator, the cue mix \u2013 everything was there. And it was a super nice machine already. I expected it to be some sort of cardboard box with some cheap knobs on it. So I was totally blown away. Plus, Marcel and myself, we got along really well almost right away. Quickly I asked him if he would be willing to help me build a mixer for myself and he told me, \u201cSure, let\u2019s do it, I\u2019m happy to help you.\u201d After some discussions, we decided to not only build one mixer for myself, but to build a batch of 10 mixers with the idea that we could sell one here and there to our friends.\nShortly after we met, we began to work on it. First we did some revisions on the original prototype. We did proper branding and everything, but it was very much a project. It was never the idea like, \u201cHey, that\u2019s our business idea let\u2019s build a company.\u201d So by the time we finished those first ten mixers, they were already sold out. During the process, when we were building everything, people started to call us. You know, like, \u201cHey, my friend told me that you\u2019re building mixers now, is that true?\u201d and we\u2019d be like \u201cYeah, we\u2019re trying\u201d and they\u2019d go \u201cI\u2019ll take one!\u201d\nAL: What was your role in the beginning, since you mentioned that Marcel already built this original prototype? Was there any sort of technical component that you were adding to the process of building this first run of mixers?\nSS:All of the electronic design is done by Marcel himself. He\u2019s like the mastermind of Varia Instruments, because he\u2019s an electronics engineer. Plus he\u2019s a sound engineer. And my part is the mechanics. I did an apprenticeship in mechanics, so I could bring in my knowledge on the hardware side of things, especially the housing of the mixer, the face plates, etc. But I was also just another creative mind, another perspective on what DJing is, how to use it, and ways it could be improved. It really is the Dream Team: Marcel with his deep knowledge of electronics, about audio technology; my background with the more mechanical things, with the creative side of things, and together it works very well.\nAL: You built the first ten mixers and they've all sold out. What was the next step?\nSS:We were pretty surprised about all of the new orders coming in and decided soon after to do another run. It really started picking up, and there was some real demand. Step by step we went further down the road. We increased the order quantities for all the materials and after a couple months we began to enlarge our tiny workshop. And something we\u2019ve done since the very beginning is to optimize wherever we see room for improvements: It may be a step in the production line, a new component that results in better quality, or a process that could run smoother afterwards.\nWe never stop exploring. Marcel and I aren\u2019t the risky business types either. The way we went really suits us \u2013 better many small steps towards the right direction than thinking big and finding investors and doing weird things to expand profits. After a while, Marcel quit his job. Another year later, I quit my job as well. It all grew very organically, and it still does.\nAL: It's wild to think that when the business with Marcel started growing, you guys only knew each other for a few years. What was it like quitting your job and going into business with someone who was, essentially, a new person in your life? Did you ever have any hesitation like, \u201cMan, I don't really know this guy. Could he screw me over?\u201d\nSS:I was never worried about that, because Marcel and I have very open communication and honesty is very important for both of us. I mean, we are similar in a lot of ways, but we also share some differences as well. He is a pretty calm, quiet person, and I\u2019m more like the loud, extroverted guy. Even our interests are different. But somehow it was almost like fate brought us together and these differences between us are all really healthy because you always need to discuss things, share your perspectives, and you have to find your path together. It\u2019s really helpful in a way.\nAL: So you guys have built the RDM20. How were you selling these? Still word of mouth, or were you marketing it yet?\nSS:Yeah, the RDM 20 was our first product. And even when we were building those 10 mixers I mentioned earlier, we made an effort to somehow do it properly and to create a brand. My girlfriend at the time was a graphic designer, so we got her to make a proper logo, we built a website, we shot some nice photos, but we never expected it to go this way. It was always more of a fun project than a business.\nAL: When did you start development on the other Varia Instruments products? Specifically, the turntable weights and the RDM40.\nSS:Two years after that first run of mixers, we began working on our turntable weight: the TTW10. And again\u2013this was a product that we developed out of a need from ourselves. Also around this time, the first clubs began contacting us and asking if we had a 4-channel mixer available. At first we didn\u2019t feel it was necessary (as you can connect up to four line sources and two turntables to the RDM 20), but as time went on, our opinion began to change. I think we were up for a new challenge, and there was some real demand for a 4-channel model. So, we started to sketch, then we built models out of cardboard boxes, later with CNC milled wood parts. This early process of creating something from scratch has an incredible magic to it and it\u2019s without a doubt what I like most about my job!\nAnyway, from the first drawings of the RDM40 to the final product, it took around three years. That\u2019s a long time, but we had to keep up with the production line for the RDM20 and the turntable weights, too \u2013 busy times!\n\u201cI think the most difficult part is to create a product with a top quality standard, which pays our bills on one side, but is affordable for the DJs out there.\u201d\nAL: When you were developing the RDM-40, was there anyone you spoke with from the HiFi/DJ community that gave you feedback or advice?\nSS:We always traveled quite a bit even with the RDM20. When we released it, we traveled to Paris, we went to London, we went to Berlin, and we would place the mixer for one afternoon in a record store, invite some people so they could try it, they could listen to it, and give us honest feedback. During those travels, we gathered a lot of valuable information, and more than information, but the feeling, you know, like, \u201cOkay, well, what are people down for, what are they looking for? What are the actual needs?\u201d\nIt took us a long time to define the feature set of the new mixer \u2013 where do you draw the line? We still wanted to follow our puristic attitude, but at the same time the device should cover the important functions which are needed in the club context. I am very happy with the outcome, and I think the community is as well. Both private bedroom DJs and venues reacted very positively to the newborn RDM40. We were able to create a mixer without compromising the sound and build quality, and that\u2019s the most important thing for us.\nAL: So what were some of the biggest challenges that you faced with launching this whole business? What were some of the things that stood out about bringing Varia to market?\nSS:I think the most difficult part is to create a product with a top quality standard, which pays our bills on one side, but is affordable for the DJs out there. Neither are we willing to do any cuts on the quality, nor do we want a product in the luxury price segment which is only affordable to a few wealthy people.\nWe want our products flying out, serving DJs, vinyl diggers and music lovers all around the world \u2013 so it has to be affordable in a way. On the other hand, we\u2019re facing crazy costs of living in Switzerland. Having the whole production here doesn\u2019t help to save money, either. So, finding this balance is always tricky.\nAL: When you took me on that tour of the workshop, one of the things that really stood out was how collaborative the Varia team is\u2026 Everyone plays a role. It seems like community is probably a big part of the culture. Do you think that translates to your products in any way?\nSS:Well, certainly, it brings a lot of joy to ourselves. And, there\u2019s quite a big amount of passion in this project, and we just love having a good time, so how do you have a good time? You invite your friends to do things together, that\u2019s really what we try to do whenever we can. And honestly, I\u2019m also proud to say, \u201cHey, we were able to create something, which is mostly done locally, and sell this, and make a living out of it, while having such a good time!\u201d That\u2019s a really, really pleasing way of work. Of course, it\u2019s not the cheapest way of doing something. But again, it\u2019s always been more of a passion-driven thing than a business-driven thing. So I\u2019m really satisfied with that.\nAL: Would you say that is the defining philosophy and culture of Varia Instruments? To grow organically and to do everything with passion?\nSS:Yes. Our work is driven by our passion and love for music. It is always very closely connected and it brings us a lot of joy. We want to follow a way that leads us to places where we can find this joy and passion for music. Even the business side of Varia is just an accessory thing to keep it going, but it\u2019s really not what our hearts are beating for. Yes, we want to do everything in Switzerland, and we want to do everything properly, but the passion is always about the sound, the music, and the culture at large.\n\u201cWe never stop exploring. Marcel and I aren\u2019t the risky business types either. The way we went really suits us \u2013 better many small steps towards the right direction than thinking big and finding investors and doing weird things to expand profits.\u201d\nAL: It\u2019s funny because the passion-project angle of Varia Instruments makes a lot of sense to me. When I first saw the RDM20 and RDM40, it gave me this odd sense of nostalgia, like I had seen it somewhere before. The metal casing, the analog VU meter, the backlit green cue buttons, etc. And at first I thought it must have reminded me of the 1970's amplifiers like the Marantz, the old Sonys, Kenwoods. But I read through the Varia Instruments zine and in it you described this passion and love you have for space exploration and it hit me. Oh my god, this design looks like one of the old lunar modules! Am I crazy? Am I wrong on that?\nSS:Of course not! Absolutely! We created a \u201cspace mission\u201d to underline the launch of the RDM40 because it was a huge endeavor for us. We spent three years working on this project. Hundreds of hours of development. All of the electronics were developed from scratch. It was a massive undertaking.\nYou mentioned the lunar module: when we were initially building the prototype, I designed the stand of the mixer piece by piece. I also fabricated it by myself on an old milling machine. So, naturally I took a lot of inspiration from the Apollo 11 Mission \u2013\u00a0 and people loved it. It was so beautiful to see the response and to know, \u201cWow, I\u2019m not the only space guy out there.\u201d People really loved it.\nEven my girlfriend got involved in the project. She does some fashion design and actually has her studio here in our workshop. So I asked her to make patches like the ones Astronauts have on their spacesuits. She has an embroidering machine and did some magic tricks to bring my ideas to light. It was so much fun to do that with her! Jeff Mills even heard about it and asked us for an interview for his Escape Velocity magazine. How crazy is that? It should be the other way around!\nAL: You and Marcel traveled extensively when you were demoing the mixers... Japan, and Korea, cities in the USA like Detroit, New York City, Miami, and all over Europe. Were there any differences between the places you traveled that stand out in the club/listening room/HiFi context?\nSS:It\u2019s interesting. Since we are technicians, we view the clubbing scene from an entirely different perspective. For example, when we traveled to Berlin, we were invited to Berghain to check out their sound system and we went during the daytime when all of the lights were on. It\u2019s a totally different experience than what most people who go raving at a club get to see, and that\u2019s really cool for us because it provides a detailed look at how the clubs themselves are designed. What I\u2019ve seen is that there are venues all over the world that devote a tremendous amount of passion into the space and into the sound system. But these places are still pretty rare, after all.\nSome of the differences that really stand out are the sizes of the clubs themselves. I was impressed by many tiny clubs in Japan with amazing sound and intention. European and US clubs tend to be bigger and more focused on bringing in many people, from what I have seen.\nAL: Do you feel like the smaller, more intimate clubs are more likely to carry rotary mixers like the RDM20 or RDM40?\nSS:Yeah, I would say so. The smaller clubs tend to be more intentional and brought to life through passion. If you want to build a club to make money, you aren\u2019t going to build a small, 150 capacity room\u2026 You\u2019ll build a huge space with a 3000+ person capacity. So, yeah I would say that these smaller spaces would be more likely to carry our products since it aligns with this philosophy of doing things for the love of doing it, rather than just for money.\nAL: You mentioned being impressed by the sound and vibe of the smaller clubs you\u2019ve visited in Japan. I think most would agree that they\u2019re one of the main countries that has been a driving force on everything Hi-Fi-related since, well, basically from the beginning.\nSS:In my opinion, when the Japanese do something, they don\u2019t give only 80%. And, of course, this kind of attitude is perfect when it comes to sound, because a lot of perfection is needed there. So yes, there are amazing sound systems and a wealth of knowledge about everything Hi-Fi. It\u2019s really impressive.\nIt makes sense that the concept of the so-called listening bar was born in Japan. The idea is to have a place with an exceptional sound system where people could go, enjoy a drink and listen to albums and do nothing but that. And this idea was exported to the rest of the world in the past decade.\nI love that good sound systems are popping up everywhere, but it\u2019s somehow a tricky situation: When places in the western world try to replicate this concept, the mindset of the people is totally different. You don\u2019t go to a bar and stay silent for two hours and keep to yourself. You\u2019re there to be social, to meet your friends, to go on a date, whatever. And it\u2019s not really compatible with the original concept of the kissas/listening bars of Japan. Nonetheless, I\u2019m sure that this experience can be cultivated, and there are ways to satisfy the different wishes of the visitors. Why not do a \u2018silent listening event\u2019 on the more quiet nights in the beginning of the week, and then have a more easy going evening on weekends?\n\u201cI love that good sound systems are popping up everywhere, but it\u2019s somehow a tricky situation: When places in the western world try to replicate this concept, the mindset of the people is totally different.\u201d\nAL: It\u2019s funny that you mention that, because we have a Dedicated Listening event on Mondays and Wednesdays at In Sheep\u2019s Clothing NYC.\nSS:Well there you have it.\nAL: I want to pivot a bit and talk with you about DJing and discovering new music. I watched the mix you did for My Analog Journal recently and I\u2019m always interested in how DJs discover new music so I wanted to touch on that.\u00a0 How do you find new music? Are you on internet radio, music blogs, record stores, word of mouth\u2026\nSS:I always buy a lot of records when I\u2019m traveling. So if we have a test session in a record store, I like going through the crates discovering music that way. And here in the workshop we listen to mixes all day long from other DJs, radio shows, NTS, SoundCloud, Mixcloud, whatever. I really like finding music this way because of the work the DJ puts into recording a mix. Recording a 1 or 2 hour mix and coming up with a concept or theme. But a lot of times it\u2019s as simple as a friend saying, \u201cHey, do you know this record?\u201d\nAL: On the subject of record stores, there\u2019s this quote from J Rocc in a documentary that dublab made years ago. He talks about how the best way to get to know a city is to just go to the record stores and they\u2019ll point you in the right direction. And that always resonated with me because whether it\u2019s digging, or DJing, or clubbing, whatever, it\u2019s such a small, tight-knit community that I think really brings people in. It sounds kinda like that\u2019s what you guys did when you were shopping Varia Instruments around as well.\nSS:Yeah, I mean, to have a passion for something is great. But to share it with like-minded people, that\u2019s a really amazing thing. And it can be in a record store, it can be at 2 AM on the dancefloor, in a hardware store with another mechanic. Or at an art gallery during an exhibition, you know? Wherever.\nAL: It can even be through a DM on Instagram.\nSS:Exactly."

Most people don\u2019t put any thought into the topic of room acoustics; and not until it\u2019s too late and they already unboxed their new system.\nBefore you buy any piece of audio equipment; but specifically, loudspeakers, remember thatyour room is the single most important component in your stereo.\nExhale.\nEven with something as simple as a pair ofSonos One SLwireless loudspeakers, you need to pay attention to setup and room acoustics.\nWe have listened to more than a few six-figure stereo systems that left us less unimpressed, so don\u2019t feel overly dismayed that your new $500 pair ofbookshelf loudspeakerssound broken fresh out of the box.\nExperience has taught us; and it\u2019s often a painful financial lesson, that even the best stereo systems in the world can fail to deliver the sonic experience you were expecting if set-up in the wrong room, or in a setting without proper acoustic treatment. Room acoustics affect even the best components.\nConcert venues, houses of worship, movie theaters, and recording studios utilize acoustic treatment to minimize or eliminate acoustic issues and while there are domestic issues to consider in the home setting; like your spouse hating a set of bass traps or absorption panels hanging out in your living room, the reality is that every room has acoustic issues and there are reasonable solutions to make your new pair of loudspeakers sound even better than they did in the store.\nHeavily carpeted rooms will often sound acoustically dead if combined with too much furniture. The key is to find a balance between lively and dead.\nEverything about your room matters; the shape, dimensions, surface materials, position of windows, and doorways. Sound waves interact differently with the room and the objects within it; the sound from your loudspeakers reflects off of different surfaces in your room before it ever reaches your ears. Before you buy anything, think about the type of loudspeaker you are considering and how it might interact with your room.\nIf you plan on using a typical living space like a den or living room, measure your room and determine how far back you will be sitting from the set-up location of your loudspeaker, and how far into the room you can set them up. If (like most of us) you have domestic considerations, it\u2019s unlikely that you will be able to position your new pair of loudspeakers 3-5\u2019 from the wall which might allow them to sound their best; more open, deeper and wider soundstage.\nModern homes often feature a lot of windows, and while that might offer a picturesque view of the world outside, it\u2019s often a recipe for disaster with a lot of loudspeakers as the reflective nature of glass can negatively affect spatial cues and make your system sound very bright. There are solutions to this which we will discuss.\nRoom shape and dimensions have a critical impact on bass response; bass waves require space to unfold but that doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t hear or feel bass information below a certain frequency in a small room if you make some acoustic changes.\nSound waves generated by your loudspeakers are either absorbed by objects or materials in the room, reflect off surfaces within your room, or pass through the room itself into an adjoining space. A rectangular room is often a better starting point than a perfectly square room.\nFloor surfaces can have a significant impact on the sound of your loudspeakers; stone, tile, and marble without any type of area rug can make your system more forward sounding or bright. Hardwood floors absorb sound more effectively, but they also require some form of area rug or carpeting to minimize reflections and low frequency information.\nHeavily carpeted rooms will often sound acoustically dead if combined with too much furniture. The key is to find a balance between lively and dead.\nThe first reflection points along the sidewalls can have an enormous impact on the imaging and overall clarity of the sound.\nProfessional acoustic products work as intended, but with few exceptions, they look pretty hideous in a domestic environment. Because our primary concerns are minimizing the first reflection points and improving the bass response of your loudspeakers within your existing space, there are a number of inexpensive and practical solutions that you can implement.\nThe wall surface behind your loudspeakers should never be too hard (bare walls) or too absorptive. A wall unit filled with a mixture of books, picture frames, and even records will minimize reflections (depending on the type of loudspeaker) and absorb bass if you have to place your loudspeaker up against the wall; in a scenario where your loudspeaker is really close to the wall, bass will wrap around the rear of the cabinet, reflect off the wall and arrive at your ears out of phase with the rest of the sound.\nMusic will always sound like it\u2019s coming from the wall devoid of any soundstage depth or width.\nThe first reflection points along the sidewalls can have an enormous impact on the imaging and overall clarity of the sound. It\u2019s somewhat surreal how treating these two points can make everything sound more three-dimensional and focused. You will require an assistant for this but it\u2019s a quick fix.\nSit in your normal listening position and have your friend walk with a small mirror along the surface of the wall until you see the loudspeaker\u2019s (starting at the loudspeaker itself) reflection.\nMark this with a pencil on both walls. In a professional setting, acoustic panels of varying thickness are used to absorb frequency information. In a domestic setting, consider using bookshelves, wall hangings, or even art work (without glass) at these points.\nFurniture can be used effectively to minimize reflections and absorb excessive bass; a large sofa or wood coffee table can be very effective. Glass tables should be avoided as they will exacerbate the problems we are trying to fix.\nCarpeting or area rugs can be a huge source of improvement because they will reduce room noise, impact reverberation, and absorb reflections. If possible, stick with natural fibers like wool which have better absorptive qualities.\nRoom acoustics is not a very exciting topic but if you fix 2-3 of these issues, the sonic rewards can be substantial. You don\u2019t have to spend a lot of money either. Use what you have already and get that tape measure and mirror ready.\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission."

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/vox-discotape/",
        "content": "Contrary to popular belief that the discotheque and dance revolution didn\u2019t begin until the mid-\u201970s, the whole two-turntables-and-a-mixer thing started happening a half-decade earlier. Demand was such that audio companies started brainstorming ways to capitalize.\nThe May 1973 issue of the unsung British magazineBeat Instrumental, for example, devoted 10-pages to a special section called \u201cDiscotheque Equipment Supplement: A Guide to Sounds Around and Things to Come.\u201d Noting the rise of dance clubs and DJs, one British gear maker in the story accurately explained the phenomenon like this: \u201cA lot of people who have not taken time off to learn an instrument can buy a unit, play places and be \u2018somebody.'\u201d He called the trend \u201cthe most commercial music thing ever and the future is limitless.\u201d\nAttempting to understand the trend,Beat Instrumentaloffered this funny, and true, suggestion: \u201cReasons for the discos\u2019 appeal range from the fact that people like to dance together to a symptom of life\u2019s impermanence and the swing to instant stimuli.\u201d\nThe section offered the rationale for its existence in the introduction, referencing a famed DJ for pirate radio station Radio Caroline: \u201cDiscotheques, whether Emperor Rosko leading his army through England\u2019s hills and dales or a bloke down the road taking his gramophone to the village hall, have been rocketing in popularity ever since they were realised as an alternative to second-rate groups and juke boxes.\n\u201cWith this growth in popularity has come a widening of the market in disco equipment, which now includes voice/record faders, sound and light synchronisers, deck monitor systems and even jingle and effect cassette units.\u201d\nThe Vox Discotheque (Vox Discotape in the US) is one of the most covetable of the era. Made from the same Vox shell that housed their iconic Continental Organ and featuring a sturdy chrome stand, the Discotheque featured two Garrard SP25s, Shure cartridges, a cassette recorder to capture your sets and a built-in 50-watt Vox amp. Add in sliding volume controls, cassette and microphone controllers and \u2014 get this \u2014 \u201crecord scratch and rumble filters.\u201d\nVox officially introduced the Discotape in 1971. Below, the specs, courtesy of the Vox Showroom:\nHere\u2019s one in action.\nTheBeat Instrumentalsection was revelatory for a number of reasons, most obviously for the sheer volume of makes and models available by 1973. It wasn\u2019t just Vox\u2019s market. (Sorry for the low-res images.)\nBelow, a brief snapshot from the magazine.\nFinally, to give you a sense of what was happening in the world of music tech at the time, that same issue also included an ad for a new instrument that would go on to change music: The Mini Moog.\nWant to read the whole issue?

        "title": "Berkeley/Arden: Classic Home Speakers Featuring Tannoy\u2019s Iconic Dual Concentric Driver System",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/tannoy-berkeley-arden/",
        "content": "Founded in London by Guy R. Fountain, Tannoy first gained widespread recognition in the early \u201930s with their public-address speaker systems that would be used for famous sporting and state events, as well as for the Ministry of Defense during wartime. By the \u201940s, Tannoy systems were so widely used that the term \u201ctannoy\u201d came to be used in British English for any public-address system. In 1947, the company made their second great innovation with the Dual Concentric driver, which placed the tweeter behind the centre of the medium or bass driver. This revolutionary technology would come to define Tannoy and the later audio industry with Tannoy monitors being widely used in countless studios around the world including Abbey Road, Air and Decca.\nOne of their most iconic home speaker designs, the Berkeley/Arden was released in 1976 and is a substantial sized two-way loudspeaker system that provided the high power handling capacity and sensitivity of their famous studio monitors in a more compact enclosure. The Tannoy HPD Integrated Drive system consists of a direct radiator bass unit and a high-frequency horn-loaded compression driver both located within the same frame and magnet assembly, which is why it is known as the dual concentric system.\n\u201cThe Berkley\u2019s just sounded, well, like the music was supposed to sound, like you were there. Actually most recording studio\u2019s mastered their recordings using either Tannoys or JBLs.\u201d\nThe speakers are also beloved for their cabinet design which features a dual ducted port that provides remarkable bass response for the enclosure size, and a front recess mounted loudspeaker to ensure smooth extended treble.\u00a0In this ducted 2-way system, the low frequency radiator is 15 inches (381 mm) in diameter and carries the frequency range from 35 Hz to the crossover at 1 kHz. The coaxially mounted 2 inch (51 mm) compression driver then takes over from 1 kHz upward.\nThe Berkley/Arden is a substantial size, but tastefully accented so that it does not overwhelm a normal living room. The enclosure is finished in oiled walnut with two removable brown cloth covered grilles. The upper and larger grille covers the loudspeaker cone and, while removable, need not be removed by the user. The lower grille covers two switched equalizer controls. These controls are intended to allow for minor higher frequency adjustments which a user might set to suit his particular tastes in music reproduction.\nThe Tannoy Berkeley originally sold for $480 in 1976. Unfortunately, the Berkeleys and Ardens can be a bit difficult to find outside of the UK even on used hi-fi boards and auction sites. A pair of Berkeleys will typically go for around $3,000, while Ardens can cost upwards to $10k depending on condition. They can also be expensive to repair as Tannoy is no longer in business.\n\u201cLow level listening is INCREDIBLE. The Tannoy sound amazing at very low SPL, the bass is still very present, the dynamics seem intact, harmonics untouched. WOW. There\u2019s a palpability to the music at low level that is truly wonderful and suits my needs a lot. This is something I did not expect and very happy to realize and truly quite a few leagues better in that department than the Harbeth, Amphion, and KEF LS50 we have.\u201d\n\u201cThey seem to have a depth of sound, a scale that I have not had before from any of the previous speakers that I have ever owned, and I can now see why some people are quite so passionate about them.\u201d\n\u201cForget technicalities, the Tannoy sounds slightly coloured compared to the Harbeth SHL5+. But it seems that with Tannoy, I very easily forget any flaws or coloration and really fall in the music. It\u2019s even hard comparing SHL5+ with Tannoy because it\u2019s such a different sound. There\u2019s a presence and an immediacy in the mids with the Tannoy that makes instruments and vocals sound more realistic, more weighty (of course since its a 15 inch), perhaps less detailed but more grounded in the intention of what the musician is playing. The image is immense; its a very big sound that engulf you. the Harbeth are laid back in comparison but in reality it\u2019s more like its the Tannoy that may be slightly forward in nature or perhaps simply Horn vs Tweeter? The bass is absolutely coherent with the midrange. It doesn\u2019t seem to be slower than the mids at all, and I\u2019m relieved about that. They can play LOUD!!!!!!!\u201d\n\u201cI bought a pair of Berkleys new in \u201977. I had listened to every high end speaker I could find. The Berkley\u2019s just sounded, well, like the music was supposed to sound, like you were there. Actually most recording studio\u2019s mastered their recordings using either Tannoys or JBLs.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent transient response and top end purity are only two of the attributes that make Tannoy loudspeakers so special. When you add in their high resolution midrange and coherency \u2014 you have the basis for a very fine loudspeaker.\u201d"

        "title": "Western Acoustics Builds Wooden Active Loudspeakers for the Modern Home",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/western-acoustics/",
        "content": "Hi-fi culture in the United States has long been an obsession of mature audiences with deep pockets and acquired tastes, but the massive interest in hi-fi analog systems over the past few years by younger audiences has undeniably brought new life into the industry. Both millennials and Gen Z are known for their effective knack of \u201cdisrupting\u201d social as much as consumer norms, so it\u2019s no surprise that sooner or later that way of thinking would change the way we listen to music.\nWestern Acoustics out of San Francisco\u2019s Dogpatch district are racing to lead the way and growing so quickly they\u2019re currently actively recruiting to grow their team. I sat down with the founder ofWestern Acoustics, Liam Porr, to talk about how he chose to set off on this audacious journey, and learn about how he designed and engineered a listening system that effortlessly nests into the lives of listeners.\nTana Yonas: Have you always sought out superior sound, or was exploring HiFi something that you got into later in your life? How has your relationship to sound evolved?\nLiam Porr:I think that for me, when I really started getting into audio, it was partially because I love music and I listen to a lot of it.\u00a0 But It\u2019s hard to know what you\u2019re missing out on until you listen to high-quality audio. I also had exposure to people talking about hi-fi systems.\nMy dad was really into Klipsch speakers. He grew up nearby Hope, Arkansas, where Klipsch is still headquartered and does all their manufacturing still, so he was always a big Klipsch guy. He\u2019d always talk about the Klipsch La Scalas that he had in college that he really loved, and he thought they were the coolest thing ever. I also found out recently that Paul Klipsch\u2019s wife, Valerie, used to teach my grandmother piano lessons, coincidentally.\nAt some point, I started asking myself, what\u2019s the deal with this? I was just too curious not to try and explore what all these people were talking about. And I was really interested in the technology behind them, because of some of the electrical engineering courses I was taking in college.\nTY: What was your first experience with hi-fi, then?\nLP: Eventually, I got my hands on a pair of La Scalas that were in disrepair. I really wanted to fix them up and learn how they worked. And the eventual goal was to be able to experience the high-fidelity audio that people always talked about. I looked at it as like an interesting journey working with my hands and trying to see what\u2019s possible and discover what people have been talking about. So, it was less about being dissatisfied with what I had already listened to.\nTY: How did you think about the spaces you are designing for?\nLP: For Western Acoustics, my head was around realistic living environments. I\u2019m a young guy; I live in a regular apartment with a small living room. And I want to be able to have a music system that integrates well into a room that has a lot of other different purposes. When I went over to this guy\u2019s house to buy from him.\nWhen I bought the La Scalas that I ended up repairing, I had gotten them from an older dude, and they were from his second home. He had this whole separate room for listening, it was literally just the La Scalas, a turntable and his record collection. I was super confused. I didn\u2019t understand listening rooms as a concept. Having a space where you sit down and listen to records every day and dedicate a whole room to it was very foreign to me at the time.\nNow I love that concept. I\u2019ve since learned a lot more about that kind of philosophy towards music listening. But for me personally, I don\u2019t have a room to dedicate to that. Realistically, most other people don\u2019t either.\nTY: A lot of people rely on Spotify and other digital music services in order to stream music. Oftentimes, it doesn't give listeners the quality of other mediums because of how most streaming platforms compress files. Does it make your job harder?\nLP: It definitely makes you rethink things sort of, but compromises are inevitable. In a perfect world, everybody would be listening to either vinyl records or lossless digital files, but this is not how people like to listen to music these days. Even for me, I\u2019ll make playlists on Spotify and get locked into those kinds of platforms.\nHi-fi allows me to listen to music a little bit differently. But sometimes I just want to play my playlist that I have on there, and I don\u2019t want to have to sit down and swap out records for every song. That wouldn\u2019t make sense.\nI want to allow for the fact I\u2019m moving around my apartment, like when I\u2019m cooking in the kitchen and stuff like that. I can sacrifice a bit of the bit rate for the convenience of being able to utilize these platforms in the same way I use them to listen to music on my headphones on the go.\nTo answer your question, it\u2019s not necessarily challenging, but it\u2019s just something to keep in mind to design around.\u00a0 I\u2019m not a purist. I like to think about the best way to integrate music into my life, and not making sure I have the perfect setup for every time I listen to music on my system.\n\u201cI definitely designed this product with that kind of person in mind, somebody who cares about both the beauty/lifestyle convenience side of things, and the engineering, the specs, and on\u2026\u201d\nTY: It\u2019s interesting that you're in the Bay Area famous for being at the center of new technology and culture. How has that played a part in developing your vision for Western Acoustics?\nLP: I\u2019ve worked in tech, and I was a part of that side of the culture here. I do take some of that attitude towards the way that I think about my company, both in terms of the entrepreneurship side of it, and then also just like the way that I think about products that we\u2019re going to produce. The prevailing attitude of people here is very focused on science and engineering and because of that, people are a lot more critical of the quality of the components that you\u2019re using, the specifications, measurements, and stuff like that are things that really matter to people. These are smart people, and so it\u2019s really hard to hide behind marketing. You have to have something that\u2019s really good on paper, and in person. On top of that, there\u2019s a lot of people here who want to have something that\u2019s beautiful as well as being high quality.\nI definitely designed this product with that kind of person in mind, somebody who cares about both the beauty/lifestyle convenience side of things, and the engineering, the specs, and on in addition to all these things; they have an engineer\u2019s mindset to audio.\nTY:\u00a0 Were you developing this product during the pandemic, when it was really hard to get components because of the global supply chain failures? Are you able to get the components that you want and trust that you'll be able to get them next year from now, for instance?\nLP: It\u2019s not easy, but there are some domestic suppliers that are really good. Madisound is a great one. They\u2019re the classic, you know, Parts Express is one everybody knows, but they\u2019re not known as much for supplying the highest quality components. They have a lot of great stuff, all basic things that you would need.\nBut if you\u2019re looking for really high quality hi-fi transducers, and things like that, you would go to a company like Madisound. For small quantities of stuff, they have most of what you would need, so thankfully I haven\u2019t had too many issues in the process of R&D.\nBut when it comes to actual production runs, which we\u2019ve only just started, we didn\u2019t have to deal with much of the issues everyone had during the pandemic. There\u2019s still remnants that we have to deal with. We get our woofers from a company in Denmark, and they have a long lead time because of the materials that they have to gather and because of the supply chain chokes that are still in effect.\nIt can be difficult; we have a long lead time for things. But so far, we haven\u2019t had some of the disastrous supply chain issues you hear about. We just have to plan ahead.\nYY: What products do you have available now?\nLP: We have two speaker options right now, the Type 2 speaker and the Type 1.\nThe Type 2 speaker is the one that\u2019s a bit more accessible. It\u2019s a small bookshelf size speaker that\u2019s about 16.5\u201d tall by 10.5\u201d wide. It\u2019s meant to be more like a relatively near-field listening speaker system that works well really in smaller rooms and ultimately sounds good in the home in general.\nThen we have the Type 1 system which is a much larger format speaker system, but it\u2019s still meant to not be too intrusive in the home. It doesn\u2019t have a very striking aesthetic to it. It\u2019s meant to be a bit more subtle, laid back, almost like a pair of cabinets that you have in your home. The Type 1 in particular is meant to be the flagship hi-fi system. It utilizes Japanese woofers, and it tries to get deep bass without sacrificing on transients. The woofers from Fostex in Japan are meant to produce a deep bass response into the 30 hertz range while still having a very, very sharp, fast response. You can play music like jazz or things along those lines without muddying up the sound.\nTY: And as far as designers or design movements that have inspired the kind of look of your speakers, who and what has inspired you?\nLP: I think the classic one that people tend to mention and I feel similarity about is the work of Dieter Rams. I love the work that he does and I\u2019m very inspired by him. I wouldn\u2019t say it totally encapsulates what we do, but I do really take a lot of appreciation for not over designing. It\u2019s important to ask the amount that you need to have a part of an object, you know? What are the essential components?\nI also really enjoy the international typographic style. I like that approach to graphic design, and the emphasis on readability and legibility. And their inspiration from the Bauhaus movement and just how different that was at the time from everything else. I like to ask, how can we reduce the design of something to the things that matter the most? And then how to visualize those things to people. Those are the things that I kind of think about when I think about my speakers.\nFor form and shape, I really love Brancusi and his sculptural work. I just think it\u2019s what he makes is beautiful, and I love his reduction of things to their essential forms. Using only a few different kinds of shapes, and then using those in combination with each other to make very different effects while still retaining simplicity. You can see a similarity to that in our type 2 speaker with the rounded horn on a very square baffle and shape. So I\u2019m very inspired by his work as well.\nI\u2019m obviously very inspired by Devon Turnbull and Ojas audio gear, mostly in terms of just how he reconceptualized what hi-fi can be to somebody in their life and what a hi-fi system can do. When you take it to the extreme like he has, it can be like a personal odyssey, and defining your own temple, which I think is not only fascinating but it\u2019s also very unique. I\u2019ve never seen anybody do it like that, and he\u2019s sort of defining his own category in terms of what speakers can look like.\nTY: I also really appreciate how wood is a very present material in your pieces as well, and the woodworking is really beautiful. Was that something that was important to have a natural form in the design?\nLP: Yeah, the inclusion of wood is a really important part of our audio system, and I think that the inspiration for that is using humble materials. Materials that are very accessible for people that aren\u2019t too out there. With some of the really high-end audio, I think you could get your Wilson speaker color matched with a Rolls Royce. I mean there\u2019s a certain person that appeals to. And Wilsons are the top of the line, they have incredible technology\u2026 but I think that your speakers don\u2019t have to have an auto body finish, and in most homes they shouldn\u2019t.\u00a0 I think that the natural tone of wood, and just that sort of feeling that it evokes, makes it feel more approachable in my mind, and I think I want to even take it further. Right now we use CNC machines, and classical cabinetry techniques to assemble these speakers, but I want to even potentially lean more into wood craftsmanship, and make things feel a little bit more like they were touched by a human\u2019s hand.\n\u201cI love vintage speakers, but I think that a lot of them don\u2019t really fit in a modern home with more avant-garde interior design. I felt like there was room for something different.\u201d\nTY: That reminds me of just the overall kind of collective nostalgia that's really made analog culture popular. Why do you think it's become such an important part of popular culture these days, especially since the pandemic?\nLP: Analog systems are really interesting and unique, and I really appreciate the romance of an analog system. I think that during the pandemic, I was in the same boat. Analog systems have so much culture and history and story behind them. Especially when we were really starved of that human connection. During the pandemic, suddenly you can build a different kind of relationship to the music you\u2019ve loved all your life by integrating it into a system the music was designed to be listened to. I think that sort of thing is very unique, and it just forms a stronger bond and meaning for the music that you listen to when you do it on an analog system like that. Obviously, I think there\u2019s a lot of ways that we can develop beyond old school analog, but I still think that a lot of the technology that we developed back then is still the best, and there\u2019s no reason to change it if it\u2019s not, you know, broken.\nTY: Your products obviously have a lot of integrity. When you were building the company\u2019s products and the overall brand, did you have an exact idea of what you wanted to build from day one or did it evolve during time? What were the priorities for Western Acoustics?\nLP: When I first started out I would not have been able to articulate it in the way that I\u2019m able to talk to you about it right now for sure. I was just going off of my feelings of what I felt like an audio system should be, so it was all very emotionally and intuitively driven.\nI love vintage speakers, but I think that a lot of them don\u2019t really fit in a modern home with more avant-garde interior design. I felt like there was room for something different. In addition to that, we have this different approach to listening to music in our daily lives. We\u2019ve seen how the convenience of listening to music on our phones and headphones is just becoming more and more integrated and more easy to use. I feel like speaker systems and hi-fi systems specifically haven\u2019t evolved to the same level of convenience, and I think that could use some reinterpretation. In a lot of ways, I was just designing a speaker system for myself when I did this, and I wanted to have a speaker system that fit into my home while also sounding beautiful and also being easy to use. Beauty and convenience that\u2019s weighed just as highly as the audio quality\nTY: Is your perspective being received well from others in the HiFi speaker industry at places like trade shows?\nLP: The people who have been the most vocal about us have been people in the design world, certainly. I\u2019ve been talking with a lot of interior design studios and even architects that have been very interested in the work that we\u2019re doing at Western Acoustics.\nI feel like the audio world just needs more time to form an opinion about a particular company, and we\u2019re very young. We only launched our first product in November, and so that side of it will take a lot of time. Obviously, with the design aspect, it\u2019s a lot easier to spread the visual pictures of the thing than it is to get more people to sit down and listen to them. So I think that\u2019s part of why we received so much feedback from the design world first.\nTY: Is there a genre of music that sounds best on your speakers? Or did you kind of optimize them for a certain sound?\nLP: You know, in a lot of ways I look at this as another step after vintage audio, in terms of the culture around music. The current world of hi-fi has been very centered around expensive, sometimes difficult-to-use products. The vintage audio world has a lot more unique culture around it. I\u2019m looking at this speaker system as an iteration upon that scene, so I thought about the ways that we can improve upon vintage audio without losing the soul of vintage audio. I felt like one of the main trade-offs of a vintage system typically is there\u2019s a lot of lack in bass response.\nThat\u2019s just simply because, music back in the \u201870s, \u201880s and early \u201890s didn\u2019t have as much of an emphasis on low-end bass like modern music does. That\u2019s just a reprioritization of the kinds of music that people are listening to these days, so I did try to make sure that the speaker systems that we developed had a very strong bass response.\nElectronic music can have the kind of complexity and beauty of something like jazz or classical music while still having a sound signature that is reminiscent of modern rap, R&B, hip-hop \u2013 that sort of thing sounds great. There\u2019s room-filling bass on the low-end for a lot of these kinds of tracks, especially in some of these ambient tracks that play some bass notes for a long period. It\u2019ll just fill your room with like this 35, 40 hertz wave. I really love the way that that feels, so I listen to a lot of music like that.\nTY: Are there favorite records that you like to play on your system?\nLP: There\u2019s a handful of records that I go to a lot. I listen to a lot of cool jazz, especially Bill Evans\u2019 Trio. Their recordWaltz for Debbyis one of my favorite jazz albums in the world and any of the stuff that they recorded at the Village Vanguard is honestly just fantastic. It fills the room with sound, especially with the Type 1\u2019s. It really feels like it\u2019s being played live right there in front of you.\nOn the more electronica side, I really likeSakuraby Susumu Yokota. That\u2019s a slightly more ambient electronic album and it\u2019s very beautiful. I like to listen to that one a lot, and another one similar to that, recommended by Devon Turnbull, calledSpace 1.8by Nala Sinephro. That album is also really, really beautiful. That one particularly shows how you can play really complex, transient music while having a deep, filling bass response.\nOn the other end in electronica, there\u2019s this album calledEverydayby Tourist, a British musician. Again, I think he\u2019s on the same level asSakura, but a little bit more dancey, I guess, in its taste. Then there\u2019sBeautyby Ryuichi Sakamoto. That one has a little bit more groove and I like the deepness of that music.\nTY: What's next for you? Do you have your eyes on the next frontier?\nLP: Yeah, we\u2019re going to keep building speakers, for sure. I\u2019m looking to build something that\u2019s a bit more accessible in the price range for people. That\u2019s something I\u2019m trying to work on developing this year, since the price point\u2019s pretty high still for the speakers. That\u2019s just the reality of building something high-quality in small batches.\nIn addition to that, my eyes are set on room treatment. I\u2019m working on room treatment stuff because I really think that, when we talk about engineering a sound system to sound as good as it possibly can, there\u2019s a lot of gains left on the table with room treatment.\nNobody touches it, and nobody understands it. I think there\u2019s a lot of room for improvement with the way that typical hi-fi home systems are set up.\nWestern Acoustics currently manufactures two different models from their space in SF, and you can follow themon Instagramto stay updated about their activities and new products."

        "title": "Looking to Upgrade Your Sound? Here are 10 Vintage Amplifiers of Note",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/10-vintage-amplifiers/",
        "content": "Here\u2019s a scenario that virtually anyone who has entered the home listening game by investing in a vintage power amp or receiver has likely confronted. You\u2019re aware of the brands \u2014 Sansui, McIntosh, Marantz, Pioneer, Harman Kardon \u2014 but you don\u2019t know where to start and you don\u2019t want to mess up by buying something too old, battered or temperamental.\nWe hear you. Unless you\u2019re lucky enough to be the offspring of a noted gearhead like Jimmy Carter, who taught his kids to listen to music through a McIntosh amp and high-end speakers, we all enter audiophilia and intentional listening as novices looking for answers.\nThe good news is that the internet exists, and so do very smart people who know how stuff works. Whole forums are devoted to which companies\u2019 components still hum like Cadillacs and which turned out to be Saturns. For instance, we asked a populous vintage gear Facebook group this question: \u201cWe\u2019re compiling a list of 10 great vintage solid state amps for $600 or so (or less). What models need to be on the list to avoid embarrassing ourselves?\u201d The volume and variety of responses were overwhelming: commenters recommended both receivers and integrated amps, resulting in a drool-worthy bunch of potential purchases. (We upped the price cap a little bit to reflect reality.)\nBelow: Ten killer amps that will boost your eardrum intake without denting your wallet too much.\nLike the amplifiers listed below, prices keep going up on vintage gear. Built to last and, more important, to be repaired, pre-1990 audio gear remains in demand because the best of it will last a lifetime. The Fisher 500c, for example, celebrates its 60th anniversary this year. Founded by Avery Fisher, the American company released the 500c among a line of tube-powered receivers, and it sold hundreds of thousands of them. Prices are rising for this beautiful model. Recent eBay info says they\u2019re going for about $1200 right now.\nOne of the best-selling brands of the 1970s, Marantz\u2019s receivers remain easy to find, for now. The 2270, which will run you about $1,000 delivers what the company described in ads as \u201ca walloping 140 watts\u201d per channel. If that\u2019s above your budget, try the 2230, which runs about $700. If you don\u2019t care about an AM/FM receiver, we\u2019d recommend the Marantz 1060 integrated amp, which one commenter called \u201cthe most tube-like integrated amp I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d\n\u201cThe NAD 3020 Is a no-frills, moderately priced amplifier designed to provide state of the art performance and volume levels far in excess of what would be expected from its conservative 20 W per channel power rating,\u201d reads the ad copy for the NAD 3020. A perennial favorite, it was a huge seller for NAD. As such, there are a lot of 3020s around. For a deeper dive on this amp, check outEric Pye\u2018s article\u201cThe NAD 3020 and My Quest for the Holy Grail: Exit to Vintage Street\u201dforecoustics.\nThe original Stereo Review rave from 1970 described the Sansui 4000 as a receiver that \u201cstands with a small, select group of receivers with sufficient power to do justice to almost any speaker system at higher-than-normal listening levels. The Sansui 4000 would rate as an excellent receiver at almost any price. Selling as it does for $379.95, it is clearly an outstanding value.\u201d Indeed, this classic has doubled in price since then on the used market.\nIntroduced in 1979, the TA-F7B puts out 100 watts-per-channel and looks great while doing so. A dedicated built-in phono preamp ensured that the sound coming from the cartridge received ample signal power, and seems to cannon out of the system with force. This model is harder to come by, but worth the search. Sony amplifiers, in fact, consistently punch above their weight.\nA company that earned a reputation for, in its words, \u201cproducing state-of-the-art power amplifiers at rock-bottom prices,\u201d Hafler offered its models as both kits and finished products.\u00a0This beast of an amp is a lesser-known gem, as are the other models in the company\u2019s DH series, including the 220 and 500.\nFounded by hi-fi legend Robert Carver outside of Seattle, Phase Linear started in the basement of a grocery store in 1971 but within a few years was blowing away audiophiles around the world. A massive amp, it\u2019s another easily found, immediately rewarding purchase.\nSeriously. Trust us on this one: The Harmon Kardon 730 receiver is not only a beautiful thing, but it offers a warmth of tone that will transform the sound of any record for the better. In advertisements, the company characterizes its product as \u201cbeyond specifications,\u201d which is true.\nYou may remember this amp from thesecond edition of our room recordings. The Eico Hf-81 was first introduced in 1959 and is a low powered 14W amplifier that pairs well with efficient speakers (they sound great with our vintage Klipsch Cornwalls). It\u2019s a bit harder to find than the rest of these on the list and may take a bit of work to tune and maintain, but once properly set up, this unassuming amp will beat out most anything you\u2019ll find in its $800 \u2013 $1,000 price range. There\u2019s been a growing cult following around this one so grab it if you can find one at a good price!\nWith an elegant, minimalist design and 60 watts per channel power, the Japanese-made Yamaha CA-1000 was introduced in the early 1970s, when competitors including Pioneer, Sansui and Sony were changing the game on an annual basis. A glorious tank with precise volume, tone and filtering controls, this best-selling receiver is in plentiful supply on the secondhand market, and currently go for about $600."

        "content": "Next year will mark the Sony PlayStation\u2019s 30th anniversary, and as time passes the technology that helped define contemporary gaming is rendered more and more obsolete. Other than retro-focused gamers or collectors, the PS1 nobly served its purpose \u2014 to the tune of 100 million consoles sold \u2014 and as Sony introduced the PS2 and successive models, those first consoles ended up in the basement to be unloaded at future garage sales.\nLike DVDs, BluRays and CDs, you needed a buy a copy of the game to play the PS1, which you then placed into the console tray. Sony invested a lot of money into the PS1, and that included ensuring that the sound of gameplay was excellent. Bonus: The console read and played compact discs and came with RCA jacks, which meant that when you weren\u2019t playing Crash Bandicoot, you could plug it into the stereo\u2019s auxiliary input and blast GZA\u2019sLiquid Swordsat full volume.\nYou know where this is going: 30 years later with enthusiasm for used CDs rising \u2014 along with prices for quality CD players \u2014 the PS1\u2019s secret-weapon audio output, which was as good, if not better, than many CD players of the time, is driving budget sound freaks toward the console. The Sony-built digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and audio circuitry are well-regarded by gearheads for producing clear and detailed sound. Onesound dudewho knows his stuff and put the player to the test called the quality of the PS1 \u201cthe most analog sounding\u201d player he\u2019s heard, describing the sonics as \u201csmoother.\u201d\nBecause a working PS1 can be found on Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist and secondhand shops at a relatively low price (if you pay more than $75, keep looking) compared to dedicated audiophile CD players, the console makes it an obvious choice for those looking to enter the world of CD players and used CDs. Supply and demand dictates that those 100 million PS1s hanging around will keep prices low for the foreseeable future.\nThat means parts will remain plentiful, and that the mod/makers scene can playfully reinvent PS1s without having to invest too much up front."

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/pro-ject-debut-pro/",
        "content": "30 years have come and gone and Pro-Ject seems to be entering its prime with a wide selection of new CD players, network players, and some of the most impressive turntables that the company has ever built. The Pro-Ject Debut PRO may not be the most expensive turntable in its arsenal \u2014 but it\u2019s certainly the most important.\nPro-Ject sells the most audiophile turntables in the world and the list of OEM turntables that it produces for other manufacturers is quite extensive. If you notice certain similarities between Pro-Ject\u2019s Debut lineup and other manufacturers who are focused on the market below $1,000, you don\u2019t need to have your eyesight checked.\nPro-Ject has the distinct advantage of making most of their components in-house and the R&D resources to develop better sounding turntables for less money. When you run a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility, you can experiment with different materials and setups and get the final product to market much quicker; even with the current supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic.\nNobody has their manufacturing capabilities or ability to create high-end parts and tonearms at levels that would bury most companies.\nRega probably comes the closest, but their focus has also turned like Pro-Ject on other product categories where they can complete the circle and offer the consumer a one-stop shopping experience.\nPro-Ject is also part of theMcIntosh Grouphere in America where it can be packaged with Rotel, Sumiko, Sonus faber, and McIntosh products through a vast dealer network that only enhances its appeal.\nThe Pro-Ject Debut PRO is the natural competitor to the Rega Planar 3; one of the most popular and best-selling audiophile turntables of the past 30 years and having spent considerable time with both \u2014 it\u2019s starting to look like a very different race.\nBoth turntables are the best options at $1,000 and you really can\u2019t go wrong purchasing either one. The Rega sounds slightly quicker; agile might be a better way of describing it \u2014 but that\u2019s where the race ends for me.\nThe Debut PRO is better at everything else; we\u2019ll get to that later on.\nOne of the greatest failings of the Hi-Fi press over the past few decades has been our inability or even reluctance to provide proper context for consumers.\nHow a product behaves or interacts with other components within a similar price range and how you might build a system around it. I\u2019ve been quite focused on that for the past few years with our\u201cAudiophile System Builder\u201d columnand it should not come as a shock that I think the Pro-Ject Debut PRO belongs in a myriad of systems between $3,000 to $10,000 \u2014 its performance is that good if you can stretch that far at the top end.\nListening to Miles Davis, Donald Byrd, and Dexter Gordon, I was struck by the presence of musicians within the soundstage, the low end impact with every single loudspeaker at my disposal, and the overall uptick in resolution.\nThere are some similarities between the Pro-Ject Debut EVO and the PRO but the differences that make the Debut PRO $500 more are not small and there is a wide gap in their sonic performance.\nNot Grand Canyon wide \u2014 more like Evil Knievel Snake River wide.\nThe Pro-Ject Debut PRO Turntable extends the tradition of the Debut collection with a new striking design, featuring a satin black and brushed-nickel color scheme that really makes the table stand out. Pro-Ject is not offering different color options for the Debut PRO so those looking for a Ferrari yellow finish or forest green are out of luck.\nIn a departure from the other turntables in the lineup, the new Debut Pro features an all new 8.6\u201d tonearm that features a one-piece carbon fiber wrapped aluminum arm tube for excellent rigidity and reduction of resonance.\nOne of my biggest complaints about older Pro-Ject Debut turntables was the construction quality of the arm and how it felt during operation; I suffer from a slight tremor after a serious medical event in 2009 and I was always nervous operating them due to the weight and how loose it always felt in my hand.\nA heavy-duty, nickel-plated machined aluminum bearing block ensures the tight tolerance tonearm bearings move freely, allowing the tonearm to track precisely across the entire surface of the record.\nThe new arm feels far more rigid and I did not suffer the same level of anxiety in daily operation. I do prefer the head shell hook of the Rega tonearms which are easier for my large fingers to use but Pro-Ject has designed a much better tonearm for the Debut PRO that worked flawlessly.\nThe Debut PRO also features a die-cast aluminum platter with integrated TPE damping that is a much higher grade platter than what Pro-Ject has offered in the past.\nI\u2019m a bigger fan of die-cast aluminum platters than glass ones and I think Pro-Ject has a superior product than Rega in that regard; the sound has greater density to it and I found that once I substituted a cork platter mat for the supplied felt one, music had greater presence overall and the bass impact was much firmer with all genres of music.\nIn another new change, the tonearm height and azimuth are now both adjustable, allowing for the use of a wider range of cartridges. TheSumiko Rainier phono cartridgeis included with the Debut PRO and is pre-mounted and precision-aligned at the factory.\nHeight adjustable leveling feet with integrated resonance damping, electronic speed selection, a detachable acrylic dust cover and a premium semi-symmetrical phono cable (Connect It E) round out the Debut PRO\u2019s robust feature set. Pro-Ject has also included the tools for proper alignment and setting the tracking force.\nThe Debut PRO with the Rainier spent most of the review process connected to the McIntosh MP100 Phono Preamplifier, Croft RIAA Phono, and theCyrus Audio i9-XR Integrated Amplifier. I also ran the table directly into theNAD C 316BEE V2andRotel A12MKII Integrated Amplifiers.\nI also swapped out the Rainier for theGoldring E3andOrtofon 2M Blueto see how the table reacted to very different sounding cartridges; I wasn\u2019t surprised that the performance improved with better cartridges and the tonearm is a very solid platform for experimentation.\nAnIsoAcoustics ZaZen II Isolation platformwas used underneath the turntable in every scenario.\nThe Debut PRO hits rather hard with bass-heavy music and if your system can deliver it \u2014 you will experience it.\nMy expectations for a $500 turntable are very different in comparison to a $1,000 turntable, and I really expected the Debut PRO to deliver much better sound quality than my U-Turn Orbit+, NAD C 588, and Rega Planar 2 tables when used with the same electronics and loudspeakers.\nListening to Miles Davis, Donald Byrd, and Dexter Gordon, I was struck by the presence of musicians within the soundstage, the low end impact with every single loudspeaker at my disposal, and the overall uptick in resolution.\nCompared to theRega Planar 3, the Debut Pro is a much richer sounding deck with slightly less energy from a pace perspective. Rega puts a lot more emphasis on timing and pace, but also at the expense of midrange warmth and low end impact.\nHorns have slightly more bite with the Planar 3, but the Debut PRO delivers those same instruments with greater color and depth. Both the McIntosh and Croft phono preamps really breathed some light into each recording and the Debut Pro benefitted from the extra top end extension and energy.\nSome will interpret that as \u201cdull\u201d sounding, but the Debut PRO is anything but. With the more open sounding Goldring and Ortofon cartridges, the table delivered the same level of resolution and clarity of my custom Thorens tables restored by Vinyl Nirvana.\nVocals were rich, clean, and slightly forward sounding which I wanted to hear from this table; the Rainier is a good cartridge that does almost nothing wrong but it\u2019s definitely not as punchy as the 2M Blue or E3.\nThe warmer tonal balance works better with more neutral sounding electronics but I wouldn\u2019t start from scratch if your system sounds good to you in that regard. I would stick with a neutral sounding phono preamp if the rest of your system leans that way.\nI was tempted to swap out the Ortofon 2M Black on my TD-160 Super for the Rainier, but I don\u2019t think too many listeners are going to update the $995 Debut Pro with a $700 phono cartridge.\nAnother aspect of the Debut Pro\u2019s performance that really surprised me was its low end impact with Rammstein, The Who, Rush, Metallica, and Daft Punk; most entry-level tables deliver tight and dynamic sounding bass, but it never really comes across with sufficient impact.\nThe Debut PRO hits rather hard with bass-heavy music and if your system can deliver it \u2014 you will experience it. I\u2019ve never felt that way about the Planar 3 which always sounds really quick and detailed in the low end, but rather lightweight.\nPro-Ject has also built a turntable that is remarkably quiet; none of my systems exhibited any level of hum and I could barely hear the motor at all and the platter exhibited excellent speed stability.\nIs there a lot of daylight between the $999 Pro-Ject Debut PRO and tables in the $500 range? Having spent the better part of the pandemic listening to the competition, I would say that Pro-Ject have done something really unique with the Debut PRO that isn\u2019t the flashiest looking table in the category.\nIt\u2019s an excellent platform for listening to records and a well-designed table in every respect. That you can make it even better with a cork mat, different phono cartridge, and not spend a fortune \u2014 that\u2019s a rather great option at a time when everything is more expensive and you have to watch your shekels.\nWould I buy the Pro-Ject Debut PRO for myself and be happy with it long-term if I owned nothing else?\nI think that\u2019s going to happen this year. I hated sending it back because I know I barely scratched the surface of its capabilities within the context of a $10,000 system I used.\nDo you need to spend more than $1,000 on a turntable?\nIf that\u2019s your ceiling \u2014 this is your table.\nFor more information:pro-jectusa.com/product/debut-pro/\nWhere to buy:$999 at Turntable Lab,$765 at Selfridges\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission."

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/jbl-l65-jubal/",
        "content": "In production from 1974-1977, the L65 aka Jubal is a 3-way bass reflex loudspeaker that many consider to be one of JBL\u2019s best in the moderately sized home speaker category. Featuring a beautiful glass top and wood frame, the Jubal was designed to blend in with your interior design and sound fidelity. Outside of its looks, the Jubal is beloved by vintage audio enthusiasts for its balanced and delicate \u201ccrystal slot\u201d tweeter (the Jubal is one of only two models with this tweeter design) which produces a dynamic high frequency response and wide sound dispersion. Crucial to note, while the Jubal was originally intended to be floor-standing, many owners have recommended placing the speakers on stands or tilting them back slightly in order to get the tweeters to ear level.\nRead the product notes from JBL:\n\u201cThe L65 provides unequalled performance within the confines of a compact, free-standing enclosure. It exhibits impeccable accuracy, wide bandwidth, definition and excellent high frequency dispersion \u2013 a combination of performance characteristics typically associated with much larger loudspeaker systems.\nThe system consists of three drivers \u2013 a long excursion, 12-inch low frequency loudspeakers; a powerful, 5-inch midrange transducer; and a wide dispersion, ultra-high frequency driver \u2013 all controlled by a sophisticated frequency dividing network. The low frequency loudspeaker provides bass performance that is clean and solid, the midrange unit contributes the clarity and presence characteristic of vocals or solo instrumentation, and the ultra-high frequency driver faithfully reproduces the overtone structure lying above musical fundamentals for the sparkle and crispness so essential to realism.\nThe L65 maintains its outstanding performance characteristics at all volume levels, from background music to the loudness approaching a live event. Of particular note is the loudspeaker\u2019s reproduction of the overtones and harmonics lying above musical fundamentals. Such overtones and harmonics, which are multiples of the fundamental frequency, quite often extend beyond the range of conscious perception, yet their presence is essential to preserve acoustic realism. The accuracy and extended bandwidth of the ultra-high frequency driver can be easily heard when listening to the clarity of a muted trumpet or the sizzle of brushed cymbals that often underlie a jazz performance.\u201d\nThe Jubals were originally sold for $396 back in the \u201970s. The price has, of course, gone up quite a bit since then, but actually not too significantly after adjusting for inflation. A pair will now cost you around $2-4k, which is comparable to the slightly larger sized Klipsch Cornwall IV\u2019s.\n\u201cI like mine\u2026 A lot of people here and at Lansing Heritage tend to dislike them because they \u201cplay to the knees\u201d and the LE5 mid is over matched by the 077. I have mine on 18 inch stands and they are excellent IMHO. The stand eliminates the floor coupling and gets the excellent tweeters at ear level. They are also a very good looking speaker.\u201d\n\u201cYou do have to work a little to get the best out of the Jubal. I have mine on custom stands. You have to get them off the ground\u2026 No one speaker can be everything to everyone. But my Jubals, in their current recapped state with judicious placement and excellent amplification, are a stunning bargain for under $1000. They are my current personal favorite. The tweets do not spit with great caps, and the mids are smooth and detailed. They are very lush with a seamless sound stage in the wide sweet spot and their frequency response says smooth and musical anywhere in the house.\u201d (2009)\n\u201cI heard them once many years ago when I was in my twenties at one of the \u2018stereo stores\u2019 that were plentiful and friendly back then. The Beach Boys\u2019 \u2018Pet Sounds\u2019 playing at a decibel level that almost drove me out of the listening room. No distortion whatsoever. The Beach Boys were in the room. They were out of my league price-wise, so I never pursued them any further. I have no clue as to how a full orchestra would be rendered on these. Obviously an unforgettable experience.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a super-dynamic speaker, which I like a lot. Mine were too forward in the upper mids for my taste and eventually went the way of all speakers. Many consider the L65 to be a high point in JBL\u2019s modestly sized home speakers. A former boss of mine has used 4 of them with a Marantz 4400 since new and wouldn\u2019t consider anything else.\u201d"

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/grado-labs-prestige-red3-phono-cartridge-an-affordable-turntable-upgrade/",
        "content": "Based on the reaction to myCAF 2023 editorial, many of you agree that high-end audio manufacturers and some show organisers have lost the plot. Our issue is not the availability of expensive high-end products because there will be always be a niche market for systems over $50,000 \u2014 but the lack of focus on the entry level and mid-tier products that can sustain this industry for the long-term.\nDemonstrating $50,000 turntables is fine, but understand that 99.9% of the music listening audience is never buying one.\nThe same applies to manufacturers trying to convince vinyl listeners that it makes sense to spend $3,000 to $,5000 on a phono cartridge.\nNewsflash \u2014 it does not.\nGrado Labsoffers a few phono cartridges that are even more expensive but 95% of their range is affordable.\nIt has always been my advice to invest a majority of your budget in a better turntable and only upgrade the phono cartridge after you have had some time to figure out the table and its base sonic signature; only then should one invest more in an overachieving cartridge like theGoldring E4, GradoTimbre Opus3,Denon DL-103,Nagaoka MP-110,Sumiko Blue Point No. 3orOrtofon 2M Blue.\nCan an inexpensive phono cartridge elevate the sound quality of your turntable?\nEven on a table as affordable as theAndover Audio SpinDeck Max, the $190 USD Grado Labs Prestige Red3 proved to be a genuine surprise.\nSpending $3,000 on a phono cartridge is stupid \u2014 spending anything more than $400 on a cartridge for a turntable under $1,000 is a mistake long-term that will not pay dividends.\nYou are better off buying more records than investing in something with a finite lifespan like a pricey phono cartridge.\nI attribute my 30 year relationship with Grado Labs to our mutual desire to escape sameness. And there is a lot of that in audio these days. Sameness and Brooklyn do not belong on the same page and that is why Grado Labs can never stop being what it is.\nOne of the things that has made Grado Labs so successful over the past 50+ years has been its attention to the bottom line. I was fortunate to visit the \u201cfactory\u201d many years ago in Brooklyn and the biggest takeaway was the dedication of its employees who make all of their headphones and phono cartridges.\nSitting there all day winding and assembling is a very labor intensive task and they made the business decision to keep everything at home. Grado is not a flashy company; there are no fancy offices, press junkets, or bizarre products that make no sense financially. They invested from the beginning in the tooling and machinery and even make their own packaging.\n\u201cGrado doesn\u2019t promote the Red3 as much as the Black3 or Gold3, but it might be the place to start if you\u2019re looking to upgrade the cartridge on your affordable new table or if you\u2019re looking for something for an older vintage turntable.\u201d\nThe 5mV output of the Grado Labs Prestige Red3 makes it compatible with almost every AVR, integrated amplifier, pre-amplifier, and external phono pre-amplifier currently available \u2014 not to mention active orwireless loudspeakerswith internal MM phono stages.\nThe hand assembled Moving Iron (Grado cartridges are not MM) cartridges use a four piece OTL cantilever that has a Grado specific\u00a0diamond mounted on a brass bushing. The Red3 are hand selected from Blue3 production runs which meet higher\u00a0test specifications. Only 10% of that specific run become Red3 cartridges.\nGrado\u2019s coil winding techniques, using ultra high purity copper wire which were honed during the development of the Lineage Series, have let the electrical circuits achieve unison between the four coils in each phono cartridge.\nThe Red3 is powered by a twin magnet system that optimizes the balance between stereo channels. All internal magnetic circuit parts are held to extremely high tolerances creating the desired stereo imaging.\nGrado\u2019s patented Flux-Bridger design allows the Red3 to have one of the lowest effective moving mass generating systems while creating an excellent balance throughout the full frequency range.\nThe weight is on the lower side at 5.5 grams and I actually found that both tonearms preferred a tracking force of 1.6 or 1.7 which is slightly higher than Grado\u2019s recommended 1.5 grams.\nInstallation took around 15 minutes with each tonearm because my gigantic hands made the setup somewhat fiddly; definitely me and not the cartridge at fault.\nPhono stages included the Croft Phono RIAA, Moon by SimAudio LP110 V2, and the internal phono stages of theCyrus Audio i7-XR,Schiit Audio Ragnarok 2,NAD C 316BEE V2, andAudiolab 6000AIntegrated Amplifiers.\nThe Unison Research Triode 25 and Cambridge Audio Edge A Integrated Amplifiers connected to thePro-Ject Phono Tube Box DS2also took turns with the Prestige Red3.\nThe Red3 spent time mounted (that sounds wrong) to the head shell of theAndover Audio SpinDeck Max, andNAD C 588\u2018s tonearms.\nGoldring, Ortofon, and Sumiko cartridges sat in the corner sulking.\nWhat\u2019s fascinating about the Red3 and the Timbre series cartridges (Opus3 review can be read here), is that they represent a modernization of the Grado \u201chouse\u201d sound.\nGrado carts have always had a rich, and lush sounding midrange; the overall tonal balance has certainly favored systems that needed some additional presence in the bass and midrange.\nThat added degree of \u201ccoloration\u201d also got in the way of the overall clarity and detail retrieval of the cartridges.\nWell\u2026those days are done.\nThe Red3 might not offer the overall resolution or clarity of the Opus3, but it\u2019s a much cleaner sounding listen compared to the previous generation of Prestige cartridges \u2014 my daughter\u2019s turntable collection includes aU-Turn Orbit+with a Grado Black2 and an Andover Audio SpinDeck with the Ortofon OM10 \u2014 a comparison before she returned to college revealed that the Red3 is both cleaner, more detailed, and a more spacious sounding cartridge.\nThe tonal balance is still on the warmer side, but it is now far more neutral sounding than the cartridge it replaced. The low end response is tighter, better defined, and not as meaty. Percussion was well defined, fast, and more present in every recording.\nGrado cartridges have always favored the midrange giving vocals and strings a lot of presence and color, and while that strength has not disappeared with the Red3, the overall presentation is far more open and spacious which is a huge plus on an affordable turntable such as theSpinDeck MaxorNAD C 588.\nListening to Sarah Vaughan, Billie Holiday, and Amy Winehouse clearly highlighted the improved sense of clarity, detail, and top end airiness.\nWinehouse\u2019s \u201cValerie\u201d off the BBC Sessions recording can be rather vivid sounding and even somewhat etched in the top end if the cartridge or loudspeakers emphasize the treble too much.\nThe Red3 didn\u2019t posses the resolution or level of top end sweetness of the more expensive Opus3, but it came damn close and without ever sounding hard when the late-Winehouse hit the highest notes.\nHorns have just enough bite without going off the cliff or crashing into the Death Star (Red 3 standing by\u2026sorry Biggs), and I found myself listening to Donald Byrd, Miles Davis, and Eric Dolpy well into the evening as the rain and winds pummeled the Shore last weekend.\nThe Red3 is also very good at handling less than stellar records that have not been cleaned or suffer from some rather ugly scratches.\nOne of the biggest improvements over the previous generation is the soundstage width and depth and the imaging specificity.\nTheMoon by SimAudio LP110 V2was a really good tonal match with the Red3; the Canadian phono pre-amplifier is straight down the middle in the tonal and presentation departments and it really showcased just open the new cartridge can sound if the rest of the system is up to the task.\nVocals were not as lush, but the clarity and resolution took a step forward which I really didn\u2019t expect from a $190 phono cartridge.\nThe Prestige Red3 faces some stiff competition from theGoldring E3andNagaoka MP-110; the British cart is even more neutral sounding from top to bottom and definitely benefits from a warmer sounding system where its resolution, speed, and top end sparkle can work its magic.\nThe Nagaoka is the best tracker of the 3 but it\u2019s also slightly cooler in the midrange; the MP-110 is still one of the best value carts around and probably the biggest rival to the Red3.\nGrado doesn\u2019t promote the Red3 as much as the Black3 or Gold3, but it might be the place to start if you\u2019re looking to upgrade the cartridge on your affordable new table or if you\u2019re looking for something for an older vintage turntable.\nThe high output widens its appeal and it doesn\u2019t fall into the trap of being really good at 1-2 areas and only average in the rest. The midrange is not as warm as you might expect from a Grado cartridge but the newfound detail and clarity really makes it work with a wider range of components and loudspeakers \u2014 which means that it can grow with you as your system improves.\nIt\u2019s a very capable and resolving cartridge at the price and not coming off mySpinDeck Maxanytime soon.\nWhere to buy:$190at Audio Advice|4OurEars\nRelated Podcast:The Best Phono Cartridges Under $350\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission."

        "title": "A Glossary of Essential Hi-Fi Audio Terms from Altec Lansing",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/altec-lansing-audio-terms/",
        "content": "Looking to get deeper into hi-fi, but not sure where to start? Plenty of resources and articles are available online, but they can be difficult to read and often filled with terms that don\u2019t really mean anything when you\u2019re just starting out. Luckily, there are some great resources available from the past geared towards consumers. Back in the golden era of hi-fi in the \u201970s, hi-fi audio manufacturers made it a point to provide all the proper education and resources for their customers. Often released in pamphlets or reference manuals, these guides allowed customers not only better setup their speakers system within their homes, but also understand all the nuances between the company\u2019s products. Klipsch\u2019s cult favoriteDope from Hopeaudio newsletters are one classic example.\nIncluded in Altec Lansing\u2019s 1974 manual titledLoudspeaker Enclosures: Their Design and Use, the following glossary of hi-fi audio terms is essential for any beginner looking to dive in deeper and step up their audio game. For those looking to get into speaker building, check out the full manual available at Lansing Heritage:https://www.lansingheritage.org/html/altec/plans/1974-enc-manual.htm\nA-B Test\u2013 Evaluating the relative performance of two (or more) components or systems by switching quickly from one to the other. In comparing, the sudden contrast can reveal audible differences between the units. The fair method of comparison is with no change in the midband volume level. Due to efficiency differences between speaker systems, a method for compensating sensitivity. differences should be used.\nAcoustic Feedback\u2013 An annoying interference created when sound vibrations from the speaker system cause a vibration in the record player. The phono stylus can pick up these vibrations, which will be reproduced in the speaker system as a rumble or howl. The cure is to properly isolate the record player from the low frequencies of the speaker system.\nAmbience\u2013 A term referencing a condition of room acoustic characteristics. The total of all sound conditions, but generally excluding the direct sound from the per- former or reproducer. Primarily the reflected sound condition, including decay time and frequency emphasis. A condition that might be natural in a hall, or simulated in the record manufacturing process to create a specific hall image.\nAmplifier\u2013 An electronic device for magnifying, and usually controlling, the electrical signals sent to the speaker system. High fidelity amplifying equipment consists of a preamplifier/equalizer section plus a power/ basic amplifier section. In integrated amplifiers, both sections are built on one chassis and made available as a single unit. A receiver adds the tuner section to the integrated amplifier.\nBaffle\u2013 A term applied to many areas of a loudspeaker enclosure. Most generally applied to the enclosure itself, but also widely recognized as the loudspeaker mounting board. In horn, and other complex enclosures, the term is applied to individual boards within the enclosure that shape or change the air flow from the transducer. As baffle can be used in all applications, one has to interpret the writer\u2019s intention as to true meaning.\nBalance\u2013 A ratio term referring to the relative loudness or amplitude between sound sources. The control sections of stereo and quadraphonic amplifiers have balance controls to allow adjustments between speaker systems that have different pressure sensitivity. The term also applies to frequency response balance. For instance most speaker systems have a balance control in the crossover network to allow adjustment of the volume balance between the transducers in the system.\nBass Boom\u2013 An effect created by unwanted bass resonances in the sound reproduction. These resonances can be created by many various sources: improperly designed enclosure, cabinet panels not sufficiently braced, or incorrect enclosure size matching to a particular transducer. This publication should solve these problems. An additional source can be standing waves created in the room acoustics. See Standing Waves.\nCompliance\u2013 In loudspeaker language, the term refers to loudspeaker\u2019s mechanical suspension-and the suspension\u2019s ability to yield to the electrical force applied through the loudspeaker circuit. It is the ratio of cone/ diaphragm displacement to a force applied-the inverse of stiffness. A high compliance cone assembly moves easily, and is relatively freely suspended in the loudspeaker frame.\nCompression/Rarefaction\u2013 A dictionary would define compression as \u201csqueezing together\u201d or \u201cmaking smaller by pressure\u201d. In loudspeaker terms we can use the term two ways. As a loudspeaker cone moves forward, the cone applies pressure to the air adjacent to the cone. As this air is compressed by the pressure, it reacts by moving, in a wave form, in a direction away from the pressure. The effect of minus pressure at the rear of the cone, which causes adjacent air to \u201crush in\u201d and fill the gap of the vacuum created, is called rarefaction. The further use of the term compression relates to certain high frequency transducers. Here the sound waves of the diaphragm are squeezed in a narrow horn throat. The increased pressure and better air coupling offered by a horn, increases efficiency and sound levels-still maintaining low diaphragm travel motion.\nCone/Diaphragm\u2013 At Altec, we generally use the terms loudspeaker cone or loudspeaker diaphragm interchangeably. It has been used by some companies with cone referencing low frequency transducers, and diaphragm for high frequency units. It is the part which acts as the moving piston in the loudspeaker. The cone or diaphragm is suspended or held in the loudspeaker frame, and moves in relation to the varying source of electrical signal applied to the loudspeaker circuit. A cone or diaphragm assembly, as referenced to a dynamic speaker, would include the surround, which supports and holds the cone to the outer frame, the voice coil, which is wire wound onto a support and completes the loudspeaker circuit with the magnetic gap, and the spider, which helps center the voice coil in the gap and attaches the cone to the inner frame support.\nCrossover Network\u2013 The crossover network is used in a speaker system to divide the signal waveform into frequency bands to feed the appropriate loudspeaker transducer-high frequencies to the tweeter and low frequencies to the woofer. In three-way and four-way systems, more complex networks are required to separate the signal, by frequency, for each particular transducer to reproduce.\nDamping\u2013 As damping is applied to a loudspeaker, it expresses the ability of the cone/diaphragm to stop its motion as the electrical input signal ceases. Poor damping allows motion to continue briefly as an automobile with poor shock absorbers. This hangover creates a \u201cblooming\u201d sound to the bass frequencies, and masks clarity. Ampli- fiers also have a damping factor which helps control speaker motion. This effect is sometimes highly debated, but the benefits of an amplifier damping factor greater than 30 may be more theory than reality.\nDecibel\u2013 The decibel is a standard unit of measuring amplitude. Usually abbreviated as \u201cdB\u201d, the standard is a relative term-rather than an absolute. It is used to compare two different levels, such as voltage, current, or sound pressure level.\nDiaphragm\u2013 See Cone/Diaphragm.\nDistortion\u2013 In referencing playback, any change that the playback system imparts to the source or input sound would be classified as distortion. Distortion can exist at any link in the reproducing chain, and all subsequent links will reproduce the distortion created by an earlier link. Distortion exists in two principal forms \u2013 harmonic distortion and intermodulation distortion. Harmonic distortion references the distortion created on the multiple frequencies of a given fundamental frequency. Intermodulation distortion references the interaction of various frequencies, and any distortion created from the interaction. To the ear, IM or intermodulation distortion is generally the most offensive.\nEfficiency\u2013 Efficiency is a term used in discussing loudspeaker output relative to amplifier power input. Efficiency would generally denote a percentage, i.e., 20 percent, 10 percent, or .5 percent efficient. As a 10 percent efficient loudspeaker is high in efficiency, the percentage rating can be misleading. Today\u2019s specifications have a trend towards SPL or sound pressure level. This would reference a given dB of loudness, for a given wattage input, at a given distance from the speaker system. In comparing systems or loudspeakers on this basis, 3 dB difference requires half or twice the power-and 10 dB change requires one tenth or ten times the power for a given stand- ard of input sensitivity measurements.\nEnclosure\u2013 In loudspeaker terms we refer to the enclosure as the acoustically designed housing for the loudspeaker.\nEqualization\u2013 A deliberate, introduced change in frequency response would be called equalization. There are many forms of equalization; as used in disc recording and playback, tape recording and playback, graphic tone balance, room equalization, and speaker equalization. As the term implies, everything comes out \u201cequal\u201d in the end with flat overall response between microphone input and loudspeaker output.\nExcursion\u2013 The actual movement of the cone/diaphragm assembly is referred to as excursion. The allowable cone travel, or excursion, is a factor that is important to high power applications. Linear cone travel is necessary for low distortion.\nFidelity\u2013 The degree of faithfulness to the original accuracy and honesty in sound reproduction. See Distortion.\nFrequency\u2013 The rate of repetition in Hertz of musical pitch, as well as that of electrical signals. Hertz, as previously termed cycles-per-second, tells us how many repetitions exist per second of time in a given signal. Low frequencies refer to bass tones, and high frequencies to treble tones.\nFrequency Response\u2013 The ability of a component to reproduce a range of frequencies is called frequency response. How evenly the component responds to various frequencies within the range describes how \u201cflat\u201d that response would be. In loudspeaker and speaker systems, the quotation of a response range or flatness can be very misleading. The environment in which the measurement takes place can have so many variables, and does not necessarily relate to performance in the listening room, that meaningful specifications relating to frequency response are not currently available for loudspeakers or systems.\nHertz\u2013 See Frequency.\nImpedance\u2013 An engineering term which describes the degree to which a circuit impedes the flow of an alternating current. See text for fuller explanation as applies to loudspeakers.\nLoudness Compensation\u2013 The human ear experiences a loss in sensitivity, particularly in the bass frequencies, and somewhat in the high frequencies, at low volume levels. Loudness compensation corrects this by increasing the bass frequencies and highs in the correct proportions as the volume is decreased from a concert level.\nLoudspeaker/Transducer\u2013 The terms Altec uses to describe the unmounted loudspeaker. Also referred to as a \u201craw frame\u201d loudspeaker, and designates without an enclosure.\nPhase\u2013 Refers to any part of a sound wave or an electrical signal with respect to its passage in time. Two devices are in-phase when they furnish the signal or sound simultaneously. They are out-of-phase to the extent that, at a point in time, one lags or leads the other. In two-way and three-way speaker systems, it might be necessary, as a part of design, to create an out-of-phase electrical condition in order to create an in-phase acoustical condition.\nPower\u2013 Power is the electrical energy developed to do work, such as the power from an amplifier used to drive a speaker system. Also, acoustical energy or sound pressure developed in a room by a speaker system.\nPressure Sensitivity\u2013 The specification of pressure sensitivity relates to the sound pressure level from loudspeaker output, relative to a given electrical power input. See also Efficiency.\nResonance\u2013 Resonance refers to the tendency of any physical body to vibrate most freely at one particular frequency. In audio, the electrical and mechanical resonances of the various components must be controlled so that they do not affect the tonal quality of the music being reproduced. Also see text concerning impedance and resonance.\nRoom Acoustics\u2013 The natural acoustics of the listening room play a large part in determining the overall sound of the system. Altec encourages your experimentation in various speaker placements to determine what sounds best in your room. In general, attempt to have opposite surfaces of opposite textures-such as hard and absorbent. Also see further information under Standing Waves.\nRumble\u2013 As its name suggests, rumble is a low frequency rumbling noise produced by poorly built turntables or record changers. Because of the low frequencies of rumble, it can often be confused with acoustic feedback. Proper speaker system placement requires a good under- standing of both acoustic feedback and rumble.\nSpider\u2013 The spider is the name of the mechanical collar, located at the neck of the cone/diaphragm, which fastens the cone to the inner portion of the loudspeaker frame and helps keep the voice coil centered in the magnetic gap.\nStanding Waves\u2013 As the sound or music is reproduced from the speaker systems, the wave fronts move forward through the listening room, hit the opposite wall, and are then reflected back into the listening area. Depending on the ceiling height, room width and length, these waves can create an in-phase or out-of-phase condition which is detrimental to reproduction. Most frequent problems in the average room occur with an in-phase condition at 80 and 200 Hz. The goal is to eliminate these standing waves by experimenting with various speaker placements.\nSurround\u2013 The surround is the mechanical collar which fastens the outer edge of the cone/diaphragm to rim of the loudspeaker basket. Various materials are used to achieve the degree of compliance desired.\nWatts\u2013 The watt is a unit of electrical or acoustical power. The term designates the power consumed in an electrical device. In audio we specify not the power to keep the amplifier running, but rather the amount of audio power the amplifier is capable of delivering to the speaker sys- tem. Because the loudspeaker is not a particularly efficient device, the acoustic output power from the loudspeaker, in watts, is far less than the amplifier audio power input."

        "title": "Speaker Wire Doesn\u2019t Matter. Does it?",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/speaker-wire/",
        "content": "If you hang out in a hi-fi group for any length of time, inevitably the question of speaker wire comes up. What gauge? Regular copper or oxygen free? Does copper purity matter? What about distance from speaker to amp? Should you worry about conductivity? Corrosion resistance?\nThese are valid questions, but the more you research and learn the more you see that there are a lot of shysters out there looking to profit off of what, in the end, regards a simple equation easily solved.\nThe oft-ridiculous arguments for and against certain approaches to connecting speakers to amplifier can be best synopsized by this comment on a popular Facebook group:\n\u201cCloth lamp cord from the 1960s. But it has to be made in Baltimore not Chicago. And it has to be made on Tuesday in the AM not any other day.\u201d\nAt the other end of the spectrum is another response arguing that it makes no difference unless there\u2019s a question of distance:\n\u201cHome depot 16/2 lamp wire \u2026don\u2019t spend one cent more unless you are running it over 50 feet.\u201d\nAmid all of these conversations about speaker wire, we came acrossa fascinating storythat pretty much debunks 90% of the arguments for investing too heavily into speaker wire. Written by audio engineer Roger Russell, it presents an overview of the various arguments for and against listening differences based on wire quality. The most compelling was a story about Gordon Gow, president of McIntosh:\nIn the early 1980\u2019s, special speaker wires were beginning to appear on the market. Some of the claims were totally unbelievable and had prices to match. Realizing that wire resistance was the critical factor in speaker wire, Gordon Gow, President of McIntosh Laboratory, used a speaker cable demonstration to show there was no listening difference between these wires and plain line cord. He delivered his presentation about the truth in speaker wire using a reel of Monster cable to stand on. Fifty-foot lengths of wire were used in the comparison.\nThe controlled demonstration provided an instant A/B comparison. Listeners didn\u2019t know the wire configuration. The result: \u201cIt can be solid, stranded, copper, oxygen free copper, silver, etc. \u2014 or even \u2018magic\u2019 wire \u2014 as long as the resistance is kept to be less than 5% ofthe speaker impedance. There is no listening difference as long as the wire is of adequate size.\u201d Gow performed this demonstration all over the country.\nIn a 1983 issue of Stereo Review, writer Laurence Greenhill published a survey called, \u201cSpeaker Cables: Can You Hear the Difference?\u201d Notes Russell:  \u201cIt compared Monster cable, 16-gauge wire and 24-gauge wire. The price at that time for a pair of 30-foot lengths of monster cables was $55.00. The cost for 16 gauge heavy lamp cord was $.30/foot or $18.00 and the 24 gauge \u201cspeaker wire\u201d was $.03/foot or $1.80.\u201d\nGreenhill\u2019s conclusion?\nSo what do our fifty hours of testing, scoring and listening to speaker cables amount to? Only that 16-gauge lamp cord and Monster cable are indistinguishable from each other with music and seem to be superior to the 24 gauge wire commonly sold or given away as \u2018speaker cable.\u2019\nHe did include a caveat, though:\nRemember, however, that it was a measurable characteristic \u2014 higher resistance per foot \u2014 that made 24-gauge sound different from the other cables. If the cable runs were only 6 instead of 30 feet, the overall cable resistances would have been lower and our tests would probably have found no audible differences between the three cables.\nStill, the conclusion was pretty definitive:\nThis project was unable to validate the sonic benefits claimed for exotic speaker cables over common 16-gauge zip cord. We can only conclude, therefore, that there is little advantage besides pride of ownership in using these thick, expensive wires.\nRead more about these tests and argumentsat Russell\u2019s site, which features this useful old school HTML chart:"

        "title": "Thorens TD 1500 Turntable: Modern Improvements on a Classic",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/thorens-td-1500/",
        "content": "Does familiarity truly breed contempt? Having invested a sizeable amount of money over the past decade in three restored Thorens turntables fromVinyl Nirvana, there was both intense interest and some skepticism on my part in regard to the new Thorens TD 1500 Turntable.\nSwiss-made (or German-made depending on the decade) Thorens turntables have been prized by audiophiles for both their sound quality and precision engineering since 1957 with the launch of the TD-124 idler drive turntable, and that list has grown over the years to include the TD-145, TD-150, TD-160/Super, and TD-125 belt-driven models.\nThorens relocated their manufacturing to Germany, Poland, and Switzerland during some rather tumultuous decades for the company as it struggled to combat the birth of digital audio, and only recently in 2018 was restructured with new ownership that is based in Germany.\nThorens is back in the game of manufacturing brand new high-end turntables but has shown little interest in supporting legacy products that were some of the best belt-driven turntables ever made.\nSo why buy a used Thorens and have It restored to its original glory?\nWhy not buy something new?\nThorens is making a strong case for itself with new models like the TD 1500, TD 1600/1601 andTD 124 DD.\nThe TD 1500 pays homage to the ground breaking TD-150 and whilst there are some similar design cues \u2014 the modern version offers a number of substantial changes that make it far more user friendly and competitive from a performance perspective with other turntables in the $3000 to $4,000 range.\nSticking with the past, the Thorens TD 1500 is a manually operated deck that still features a sub-chassis that is designed to decouple the turntable and tonearm base from the motor and frame through 3 conical springs.\nThe difference between the older deck and the TD 1500 is that the springs can now be adjusted from above through corresponding holes that have been drilled into the platter.\nHaving used a TD-145, TD-160 Super, and TD-125 for the better part of a decade, there is no question that the TD 1500 is easier to adjust and forget.\nThere is also no question that it bests the TD-145 and TD-160 Super in some areas rather handily. Not entirely sold on that when it comes to the TD-125.\nThorens now offers the TD 1500 with the Ortofon 2M Bronze; which is an entirely appropriate high output MM cartridge for a table of this caliber. Some users will likely install something different, but it proved to be very competitive against my own Thorens tables with Dynavector, Ortofon, and Goldring cartridges installed.\nAnother new twist is the inclusion of both RCA and balanced XLR outputs on the rear panel of the TD 1500; thePro-Ject X2 Bthat resides in my office system is another deck that offers a similar set-up but for less money.\nAt the time of the review, I did not have an external phono preamp with balanced inputs/outputs to ascertain if that would make any difference; and with the 2M Bronze being a MM cartridge \u2014 a somewhat irrelevant test.\nLet\u2019s be frank. The tonearm offered on the original TD-150 was rather crude and it explains why SME tonearms were so popular on Thorens decks over the years.\nThe TP 150 tonearm, which reminds one of much older EMT arms from around the time that I was born, offers superior build quality, adjustability, and the Ortofon-designed detachable head shell.\nIts operation on the TD 1500 was extremely smooth and one can tell that the bearings were no afterthought.\nHaving used a Rega tonearm on my TD-160 Super for many years, there is no question that the TP 150 is superior from a built quality perspective and offers a much higher level of refinement.\nThe Rega, however, works extremely well with the Ortofon 2M Black that has been used on it for the past 5 years; I did have a custom counterweight made for it and the internal wiring is Cardas.\nIt is definitely not a stock version of the RB300.\nThorens provides all of the necessary tools to finalize the cartridge installation; including an excellent overhang gauge, which is in the form of a LP-sized template with a strobe disc on the other side.\nThe anti-skate is set for you at the factory which was a nice touch.\nInstallation was rather easy.\nRemove the two transit screws, position the high quality belt, platter and record mat, install the head shell with the pre-installed 2M Bronze and mount the counterweight.\nAnother advantage is the TD 1500\u2019s electronically-controlled motor, providing automatic speed change.\nComparing the 4 turntables, the TD 1500 offers superior speed stability and the tonearm offers very little play; the decades of technological advancement have produced a table that is better engineered and certainly easier to setup and maintain.\nThe original TD 150 and the TD 1500 are rather similar in size and weight; the new deck is 42 x 15 x 36cm compared to the original which was 39.4 x 12.5 x 32.5cm (W x H x D).\nThe bigger change involves the new platter that is only 1.4 kg compared to the 3.2 kg platter of the original. The TD 1500 weighs in at 8 kg versus the 6.7 kg of the TD 150.\nFrom a build quality perspective, there is no comparison. Everything about the TD 1500 is more solidly constructed and that includes the armboard. The TD 1500 and the TD-125 share a lot in common in that regard. Both are solid decks and likely to last longer than their owners.\nThe TD 1500 is available with either a black or walnut plinth; definitely go for the walnut finish.\nThorens tables most certainly have a \u201chouse\u201d sound that is less accurate sounding than a VPI or Clearaudio turntable.\nNobody has ever described a Thorens deck as being \u201cclinical\u201d or \u201coverly neutral\u201d and that is certainly part of the charm \u2014 at least it has always been that way for myself.\nThe TD 1500 still offers the trademark presence and weight of a quality Thorens deck, but there is no question that the edges are more refined and everything is delivered with greater pace.\nRega pacing?\nNot entirely sure one could say that it moves music along with the speed of a Rega Planar 8, but it does conduct its business with more of an attitude than any of my restored decks.\nListening to a wide range of newBlue Note Tone Poet releasesconfirmed a few other new details about the TD 1500.\nThorens decided to keep the midrange of the TD 1500 consistent with older designs in terms of timbre and texture, but the clarity and resolution are very different; every instrument within the mix was easier to discern and the uptick in detail was notable into the lower treble.\nI would be the first to concede that my older Thorens tables don\u2019t exactly illuminate the treble range as well as other decks; and that is with some excellent cartridges like the Dynavector 10\u00d75, Ortofon 2M Black, andGoldring Eroica HX.\nThere is less treble energy compared to the TD 1500 and it was especially noticeable with myMagnepan LRS/Cambridge Edge A combination that the new design is slightly thinner sounding overall \u2014 which is trade-off for the improvements in overall clarity and top end detail.\nMale vocals have greater tonal weight through the older tables, but they are also not carved as precisely within the soundstage and there is no question that the TD 1500 pushes vocals further out into the room.\nAre the changes huge? Not necessarily depending on the rest of your system, but the TD 1500 was certainly not overly polite with any recording and the additional top end energy was never a bad thing.\nThe Thorens ethos remains but with a more, modern sounding edge.\nThe low end is better defined; although not necessarily thicker or more resolute sounding.\nFor myself, a turntable needs to offer accurate speed stability, strong presentation of timbre and texture, and genuine presence to stand out.\nTables that offer a clinical reproduction of music don\u2019t cut the mustard. Regardless of price or engineering excellence.\nDid Thorens play it safe with the TD 1500?\nNot really.\nThey simply took what was excellent about older decks and refined it with improved clarity, better detail retrieval, and a quicker sounding presentation.\nThe biggest improvement is the tonearm which will work with a wide range of high-endMC and MC cartridgesmaking this turntable a rather exceptional platform to enjoy your record collection.\nThe build quality is excellent and most certainly superior to the decks that came before it.\nThe TD 1500 may not offer the sex appeal of the TD-125 orPro-Ject X2 B\u2014 but that\u2019s not what should matter to you in the end.\nOne of the reasons why I invested so much money in 3 restored Thorens turntables is that they were built to last and deliver excellent sound quality that I can pass down one day to my children and grandchildren.\nThe TD 1500 joins that illustrious club with even greater swagger.\nWhere to buy:$2,999at B&H Photo\nFor more information:thorens.com\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission."

        "title": "Altec Lansing Model 19: Studio Quality Sound for Home Listening",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/altec-lansing-model-19/",
        "content": "Released in 1976, the Altec Lansing Model 19 was a 2-way vented floor type speaker system that introduced a new technology developed by Altec engineer Clifford A. Henricksen: theradial phase plug / Tangerine driver, which greatly improved the speaker\u2019s high frequency response. Beloved for its crystal clear and natural sound (likened to studio monitors), sensitivity, and wide soundstage, the Model 19 has over the decades become regarded as one of the best home speakers systems ever made and, to some ears, even rivaled Paul W. Klipsch\u2019s legendary Klipschorns. From the Model 19 brochure\u2019s liner notes:\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done some intense research into speaker performance limits, resulting in radical new technology in our high frequency drivers\u2026 the radial phase plug, the key to Nineteen\u2019s versatility. This sharp contrast to conventional phase plug design is the innovative force behind the wide-range capabilities of the Model Nineteen, offering a system proving the ultimate in full range response.\nIf you\u2019re looking for extremely low distortion, top power capacityplusextended bandwidth \u2013 look no further. The Nineteen offers all the bandwidth advantages with none of the crossover problems found in many floor-standing three-way systems. The result: a powerful two-way system with unequaled high-end plus commanding low-end response.\nThe Nineteen also features a dual-range equalizer designed to allow smooth, gradual equalization, compensating for variations in room acoustics or personal listening tastes.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s overwhelming full-range capability and response is aided by an optimally tuned, vented enclosure, the product of more exhaustive investigation, which makes the Nineteen ideal for home listeners who want studio-monitor performance and quality.\nAlso, the Nineteen\u2019s beautifully-styled oiled oak or walnut cabinet, hand-rubbed and finished on all sides, makes it an integral part of any listening environment.\u201d\nThe Model 19\u2019s originally sold for $659 MSRP. Of course, times have changed\u2026 These days, a pair typically goes for around $2k to $5k on the used market, which is comparable to vintage Klipsch Cornwalls. The used market pricing for Model 19\u2019s is typically dependent on the condition of the foam that surrounds the horns. If you find a pair that has the foam deteriorated or completely rotten, it\u2019s possible to purchase a custom made set of replacements from independent makers with some research.\n\u201cAltec 19 replaced my Cornwalls which were recapped and had MAHL tweeters. Deeper in the lows, and faster bass with shorter transients in general, and smoother mids: less shouty.\u201d\n\u201cI have Nineteens, and love them. I have lots of other speakers also, but the Nineteens are currently the daily use speakers, driven by a McIntosh MC240, plenty of power. What do I like the most about them? The way that they can present music exceptionally well, and image well, at low volumes (SPLs) as well as high. Many speakers tend to need to be \u2018turned up\u2019 before you hear all of the music and detail, not the Nineteens.\u201d\n\u201cAs much as I love Klipsch, the 19s, for me, are the best overall speaker I\u2019ve ever heard. Yes, they are a 2 way, instead of the 3-way big Klipsch\u2026 but Paul always wanted the Klipschorn to be a 2 way \u2013 hence the Jubilee. The\u00a019s have all the presence of Klipsch, but have a very natural and real sound.\u00a0 Having a direct radiating 15\u2033 woofer, I\u2019m sure there is more modulation distortion at high levels in the 19s than the Klipschorn or La Scala, but at the levels I listen, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever hear it. The 19s have a very different sound than Klipsch, and if I had the space/money, there would be a set of La Scala in my home as well.\u00a0Everyone has their own tastes, but I would say the 19s are definitely worth a listen at least \u2013 if for nothing more than experiencing essentially a legend within the audio world, just like Klipsch.\u201d"

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/the-art-of-the-piano-trio-exit-to-vintage-street/",
        "content": "Every now and then, a listening session turns into something more. You lose yourself for a few minutes, or for a whole record side. You engage with the music. You float and drift amongst the notes and instruments. Time stops. Transcendent. This is what it\u2019s all about. A better quality audio system takes this to another level, and my first experience in ajazz kissain Japan changed everything for me.\nThe transcendent experience doesn\u2019t happen all the time, but occurred a few evenings ago listening to Billy Taylor and his trio on the 1959 release,One for Fun. With Earl May on bass and Kenny Dennis on drums driving the rhythm on a tight and soulful outing. Perfect. It made me start to think about the piano trio sub-genre of jazz, and what made me fall in love with that combination.\nEarly in my jazz listening, I was drawn to the pyrotechnics of the trumpet and sax. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I still love those instruments and groupings that include one or both, but there\u2019s something about the trio. The most elemental, and intimate grouping. Just piano, bass and drums. Piano typically in the lead, but a far more democratic grouping than when the limelight-stealing brass are involved. Bass and drums with more to say in the musical dialogue, and greater soloing opportunities for these oft neglected instruments.\nLee Morgan can take the night off.\nThere are so many great pianists for listeners to explore; some well-known, and some flying under the radar. A list of the major artists should include: Bill Evans, Wynton Kelly, Red Garland, Chick Corea and Herbie Hancock, all famous for their work with Miles Davis, and for their own trio work. McCoy Tyner of John Coltrane\u2019s famous quartet and Horace Silver of the Jazz Messengers, both leaders and creators of some of the most memorable music from the period. Sonny Clark, Thelonious Monk and Oscar Peterson; all known for their supporting roles on some of jazz\u2019s greatest albums, and for their own projects as leaders.\nAnd who can forget Dave Brubeck, Ahmad Jamal or Duke Ellington. Bud Powell probably belongs on this list as well. The Philadelphia-native recorded some beautiful albums over the course of his career with Charlie Parker and others;Jazz Giantis a must listen if you\u2019ve never heard it and want a serious taste of his playing and compositional skills. A very underrated jazz pianist that you need to explore.\nNow if you\u2019re not a big reader, and you haven\u2019t explored most of these artists yet, you can stop right now. Truth be told, you could build a substantial jazz collection on just Bill Evans\u2019 and Oscar Peterson\u2019s work as band leaders and sidemen. But dig and explore a little deeper and wider; you will discover that there are numerous other underappreciated jazz pianists to be found. This is where I\u2019ve been playing of late, and I\u2019ve been loving some of the relatively unknown but stellar pianists and recordings that I\u2019ve dug up.\nTwo very distinct experiences spring-boarded my curiosity and have informed my ongoing piano trio explorations. First, in May 2019, my wife and I went to Japan for a few weeks to have a holiday and visit family and friends. Japan is a special place and there are aspects of it \u2013 from the perspective of the music listener \u2013 that we really don\u2019t have here.\nA secondary mission this trip was to visit as manyJazz kissas(jazz bars/coffee shops) as possible. The Japanese culture puts a great deal of importance on ceremony. To have a cup of tea at akissaten(\u201ctea-drinking shop\u201d) while listening to jazz has been a part of Japanese culture since 1929, but the modern connection between kissa and tea is more tenuous. Kissa are more about coffee (which also became popular during the American occupation), because coffee and jazz together were seen as very western and exotic.\nThe Second World War had a profound impact on the jazz kissa movement; listening to American jazz music was obviously forbidden with the two countries engaged in warfare across the Pacific and it had to remain underground during the war years. American jazz artists became popular again in Japan in the 1950s and 1960s, but very few people could afford the prices of the records. That reality made the jazz kissa the only place that the average person could enjoy the music.\nOur first night in Fukuoka, my wife met up with an old friend, so I headed out for some solo exploring and happened across a spot calledJazz Bar Browny. Arriving quite early (they had just opened, and the place was empty), I grabbed a seat at the bar and started chatting with the\u201cmaster\u201d(bartender and owner). He asked if I had any requests, and I suggested Duke Jordan\u2019sFlight to Jordan.\nOn it went. Perfect for this setting and their superb system. They really do have a very different appreciation of music and jazz in Japan and I long for the day that I can experience something similar in Canada or the United States. It will never have the same atmosphere as the jazz kissas in Japan, but I think we need them. It might sound somewhat crazy (and even sad) to some, but jazz listeners in Japan will spend an entire day and evening listening to their favorite jazz recordings (both vinyl and CDs) in a jazz kissa. It serves as an opportunity to socialize, drink, and enjoy a lot of wonderful music on some excellent audio systems.\nThe Japanese do not have a lot of space. Certainly not the kind of space for the systems used in these jazz bars and coffee shops. The jazz kissa provides an opportunity to really experience music in a special way.\n\u201cOne night in a Japanese jazz kissa changed music listening for me forever. My love for the jazz piano trio began in the most unique way possible.\u201d\nDuke and his crew sounded amazing, and at the end of the first side the master asked me for my top pianists. I mentioned some of the aforementioned artists. On reflection I wonder if he thought I was some ignorant westerner who read that list in a stereo magazine.\nHis gleeful response made me realize how lucky I was to be in that special moment.\n\u201cTonight, I will teach you about my favourite jazz piano players!\u201d he yelled across the bar which was starting to get busy.\nAnd so began a procession of performers and records I\u2019d never heard of. Some got played (and have since been added to my collection), and some only talked about, photographed and filed away for later reference.\nThat night changed music for me.\nBilly Taylor \u2013One for Fun(1959): The album that got me started on this article, and that I happily managed to track down just a few months ago. Taylor was not just a brilliant pianist and composer, but a jazz educator and promoter as well. Leonard Feather called him, indisputably \u201cthe world\u2019s foremost spokesman for jazz.\u201d He recorded prolifically in the \u201850s and \u201860s, but much of his discography is out of print and tough to find, particularly on vinyl. His swinging, bebop playing is elegant, crisp, brightly playful and inventive, and guaranteed to put a huge smile on your face.\nTsuyoshi Yamamoto \u2013Night and Day Live at Misty(2014): Yamamoto is a Browny favorite and performs there regularly. He was self-taught (as far as jazz piano is concerned). In the 1970s, he was both the house pianist at Misty, a Tokyo jazz club for which this album was recorded for their 30thanniversary, and recorded prolifically by the renown Japanese jazz label,Three Blind Mice. His playing features energetic, funky syncopation, and a dominant right hand. Yamamoto gets an audience to move its feet.\nJack Wilson \u2013Jack Wilson Quartet featuring Roy Ayers(1963): This was Wilson\u2019s first album as leader, with Roy Ayers on vibes making this not a trio recording, but maintaining the democratic trio feel. Wilson\u2019s playing has been knocked for being derivative, with comparisons drawn to Bud Powell and Horace Silver, but I\u2019m no expert on that and truly enjoy his jaunty, bouncing, rhythmic style. I get predictive hints of Ryo Fukui (whom he predated) in some of his work, which is certainly nothing to complain about.\nMichel Sardaby \u2013Blue Sunset(1970): Sardaby hails from the island of Martinique in the Caribbean but moved to Paris in the \u201860s where he began his career, before settling in New York.Blue Sunset, recorded in Paris with Gilbert Rovere and Philippe Combelle, is a perfect late-night post-bop spin; warm, sophisticated, laid-back, and infused with a touch of the blues. It is easy to imagine that you\u2019re in some dark piano bar just before closing. I\u2019ve since found several more of his releases, and they share a similar vibe, with later albums featuring more of a Latin swing.\nOther records pulled and not played that night were by Dick Morgan, Morris Nanton, Monty Alexander, Harold Mabern and\u00a0Tete Montoliu. For some I\u2019ve added records to the collection, and others still feature on the Discogs wish list, to be explored at a later date.\nMy second \u201ctrio experience\u201d \u2013 more prolonged \u2013 took place on our return to Canada in June. With curiosity aroused, I looked further into Japanese jazz artists; and pianists in particular. This brought me back full circle tomy first brushes with jazz 25+ years earlier. Over and over, I came across\u00a0Ryo Fukui, the godfather of Japanese jazz piano (or at least the most famous jazz pianist outside Japan). I ordered a copy ofScenery, his 1976 debut, and from the cover image and further reading about his origins, connected the dots to my time living in Sapporo in the early \u201890s and listening to him play live on Wednesday nights.\nFollowing the breadcrumbs and reading more about Fukui, led me toBarry Harris, another performer-educator cited as one of his biggest influences and best friends. He wasn\u2019t a performer that I was familiar with, but I soon realized that I needed to learn more about him as he\u2019d accompanied the likes of Art Farmer, Donald Byrd, Dexter Gordon, Hank Mobley, Thad Jones and Lee Morgan on some of my favourite records.PreminadoandThe Last Time I Saw Parissoon joined the growing piano trio collection of albums at home.\nFurther investigation of Japanese jazz piano stars brought Toshiko Akiyoshi to my attention, discovered playing in Ginza by a touring Oscar Peterson in 1953. He brought her to the attention of Verve\u2019s Norman Granz, and off she went into the world of famous jazz artists.\nAkiyoshi was well known in the United States in the \u201850s and \u201860s for her small ensemble work (as leader and with first husband, Charlie Mariano), and in the \u201870s for her big band work with second husband, Lew Tabackin. What makes her work distinctive is the inclusion of Japanese melodies and themes (and sometimes instruments), while always staying true to jazz sensibilities. Her 1978 release,Finesse, is a beautiful trio recording.\nAnd so for me the jazz piano journey continues, with diversions and further discoveries to be made (if you have suggestions, message me at@audioloveyyc). I know I\u2019ve missed a slew of other fine pianists here, including\u00a0Tommy Flanagan, Horace Parlan,\u00a0Duke Pearson, Kenny Drew, and more. Mentioned or ignored, all the artists appearing in this article are worthy of a listen. A return to Japan to enjoy music at my favorite jazz kissa is long overdue.\nI hope I\u2019ve sparked some interest here in a rich and enjoyable jazz style. If I have, you\u2019re in for a real treat as you work your way through some of these artists. And if you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed wondering where to start, blindfold yourself and throw darts; you can\u2019t go wrong.\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission."

        "content": "Here\u2019s a scenario that virtually anyone who has entered the home listening game by investing in a vintage power amp or receiver has likely confronted, one that\u2019s particularly timely for those who have gift money coming. You\u2019re aware of the brands \u2014 Sansui, McIntosh, Marantz, Pioneer, Harman Kardon \u2014 but you don\u2019t know where to start and you don\u2019t want to mess up by buying something temperamental.\nThe good news is that the internet exists, and so do very smart people who know how stuff works. Whole forums are devoted to which companies\u2019 components still hum like Cadillacs and which turned out to be Saturns. For instance, we asked a crowded vintage gear Facebook group this question: \u201cWe\u2019re compiling a list of 10 great vintage solid state amps for $600 or so. What models need to be on the list to avoid embarrassing ourselves?\u201d\nThe volume and variety of responses were overwhelming: Commenters recommended both receivers and integrated amps, resulting in a drool-worthy bunch of potential purchases.\nWe all enter audiophilia and intentional listening as novices looking for answers. Here are a few.\n\u201cThe NAD 3020 is a no-frills, moderately priced amplifier designed to provide state of the art performance and volume levels far in excess of what would be expected from its conservative 20 W per channel power rating,\u201d reads the ad copy for the NAD 3020. A perennial favorite, it was a huge seller for NAD. As such, there are a lot of 3020s around. For a deeper dive on this amp, check outEric Pye\u2018s article\u201cThe NAD 3020 and My Quest for the Holy Grail: Exit to Vintage Street\u201dforecoustics.\nYou may remember this amp from thesecond edition of our room recordings. The Eico Hf-81 was first introduced in 1959 and is a low powered 14W amplifier that pairs well with efficient speakers (they sound great with our vintage Klipsch Cornwalls). It\u2019s a bit harder to find than the rest of these on the list and may take a bit of work to tune and maintain, but once properly set up, this unassuming amp will beat out most anything you\u2019ll find in its $800 \u2013 $1,000 price range. There\u2019s been a growing cult following around this one so grab it if you can find one at a good price.\nSeriously. Trust us on this one: The Harmon Kardon 730 receiver is not only a beautiful thing, but it offers a warmth of tone that will transform the sound of any record for the better. In advertisements, the company characterizes its product as \u201cbeyond specifications,\u201d which is true.\nFounded by hi-fi legend Robert Carver outside of Seattle, Phase Linear started in the basement of a grocery store in 1971 but within a few years was blowing away audiophiles around the world. A massive amp, it\u2019s another easily found, immediately rewarding purchase.\nA company that earned a reputation for, in its words, \u201cproducing state-of-the-art power amplifiers at rock-bottom prices,\u201d Hafler offered its models as both kits and finished products.\u00a0This beast of an amp is a lesser-known gem, as are the other models in the company\u2019s DH series, including the 220 and 500."

        "content": "Before there was Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Record Store Day, or any other retail sales event, audiophile magazines such as Stereophile and High Fidelity ran the gifting game when it came to sound systems, components, and accessories. Full page ads delivered suggestive images of speakers and decks known to arouse the interests of deep listeners. If it looks this good on the page, the ads seemed to say, imagine how it will perform in your bedroom or living room.\nFor those of us with an affinity for vintage machinery, the components built in the 1970s have endured because they\u2019re sturdy, beautiful, repairable (mostly), and less expensive than new gear of equal quality. It doesn\u2019t hurt that many of the most desirable components either had limited runs or came and went without much fanfare, resulting in a quest-driven mentality 50 years later akin to metal detectorists scouring ruins in search of gold.\nEach December in the 1970s, the monthly magazine High Fidelity delivered a holiday gift guide that offered suggestions for sound freaks \u2014 accessories, components, etc. Though many of the specific products are no longer available, the overview remains rich with ideas that are still relevant to contemporary listeners.\nWe\u2019d kill for that GLI 5880 Creative Controller. Adjusted for inflation, that $600 mixer would cost more than $1,700. And though the home entertainment furniture to its right is cheesy, it serves as a reminder that quality record shelving remains a concern for record nerds old and young.\nIn fact,Sound & Vision, In Sheep\u2019s Clothing and dublab\u2019s seasonal market dedicated to music, hi-fi equipment, and accessories, is showcasing the work of our favorite LA shelving builders,R/D Record Cabinets, which look a ton better than the \u201ctraditional\u201d unit in the ad above.\nAt the market, we\u2019ve teamed with vendors to sell updated versions of stuff like below, including an essential gift for every analog obsessive: a Zerostat gun to zap away the static. Though Lencolamp LL-1\u2019s are hard to come by, systems such as theUberLight flex clamp LED turntable lampdo a better job anyway.\nWe copied these images from the Dec. 1977High Fidelitygift guide, an ad-driven supplement that, while a pay-for-placement endeavor, 45 years later can still offer ideas. The Garrard turntable below retailed at $189.50. A used one will set you back about $1,000 today.\nToo much to spend? Perhaps one of the monochromatic group of men below can entice you with a pair of Tandberg speakers, a receiver, or a reel-to-reel?\nA dispersion base such as the Rectilinear (below left) is a brilliant idea for your family system. If you can\u2019t find a used pair, the Wharfedale Linton stand is an excellent option. The same is true for bookshelf speakers, though maybe not the pint-sized brand below.\nThose in New York should know that In Sheep\u2019s Clothing NYC is hosting our first-everNew York Record Fairthis Sunday, Dec. 3 at Port Sa\u2019id. Though we won\u2019t be hawking any Lenoclamps, Recilinear dispersion bases or Parametric equalizers, we will be joined by vendors and labels including Luaka Bop, Daptone, Superior Elevation, The Mixtape Club and more. In addition to vinyl, DJ\u2019s, dips, and drinks, you can search through the crates of some of NYC\u2019s best labels and vendors from 12-6 PM. After, ISC NYC will host a special dedicated listening session."

        "title": "Turntable cartridges, Groovetickler and the beauty of micro-engineering",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/cartridges-groovetickler/",
        "content": "You likely know this, but the mechanical thing at the tip of your tonearm is as important as your turntable, amplifier or speakers when it comes to getting the most out of your music. About size of a Lego brick, that machine, called a cartridge, is the miraculous device that turns the sound waves inside a record groove into an electronic signal. The signal is then amplified and shot out of your speakers \u2014 as those reconstituted sound waves.\nWhat you might not fully appreciate is the sheer bounty of cartridges built over the years, both by successful brands and by solo geniuses who understand the engineering and treat them as mini works of art. No one celebrates this world better than Joseph Long, aka Groovetickler, a self-described \u201cHigh Fidelity Pickup Artist\u201d who offers \u201cfull service retipping, diamond-only replacement, coil rewinds, suspension repairs.\u201d\nA cartridge mechanic who restores and rebuilds those loaded little magical boxes, Groovetickler documents his projectson Instagram, where he regularly uploads exquisitely photographed images like this one. (All photos are from Grooveticker\u2019s Instagram.)\nThe description that Long provides next to the Sumiko cartridge above offers a glimpse of the cartridge universe:\nRare Sumiko SH\u014c high output moving coil cartridge, once retipped by van den Hul. This now has a fresh new Fritz Gyger r/R 5/100 micron FG 2 diamond installed on the original boron cantilever for one of my earliest clients. This client started sending me cartridges way back when I was just experimenting when I was known on AudioKarma as \u201cNeedlestein,\u201d and he gave me a lot of positive feedback, encouragement and confidence.\nLong mentions a few different crucial components that make up a cartridge in that description. They\u2019re defined below.\nFritz Gyger r/R 5/100 micron FG 2 diamond: That\u2019s the stylus \u2014 the tiny pointed component that directly contacts the grooves. Like all styli, this Fritz Gyger reads the microscopic variations in the groove walls and translates them into vibrations.\nCantilever: a slender rod connecting the stylus (needle) to the internal generator system within the cartridge. The cantilever, a kind of mechanical bridge, transmits the movements of the stylus to the cartridge components.\nCoil cartridge: There are two main types of internal generator systems, which are connected to the cantilever: moving magnet (MM) and moving coil (MC). The choice between MM and MC cartridges influences factors such cartridge weight and the overall sound profile. TheSH\u014cabove features moving coils.\nLast year,Long spoke with Resistor Magazineabout cartridges and his work. Not only is it a fascinating conversation, but it\u2019s a great primer on the wondrous device. It\u2019s also a can of worms that will make you wonder whether you need to upgrade your own cartridge.\nAsked by Resistor how people can ensure their cartridges enjoy a long life, Long replies:\nMake sure the cleaning person knows to leave the turntable alone. After that, proper set up. I assess diamond wear whenever I get a cartridge to repair that still has a diamond. About half of them are unevenly worn which leads to premature failure. Avoid liquid cleaners of any kind. The idea that liquid cleaners travel up the cantilever and corrode the suspension and coils is not a myth. I\u2019ve seen the damage. This is probably due to overuse, but still. I recommend dry Magic Eraser for cleaning.\nIn addition to these tips, one response by Long, a jack-of-all-trades mechanic who\u2019s worked on much bigger machines, stuck with us. It was in response to a question on how he got started.\nI had developed skills uniquely suited to cartridge or pickup repair. I had been challenging myself by repairing ever smaller things. Houses to cars to cameras to watches to pickups. There\u2019s a lot of crossover there, too. I make all my own tools and some of them really are basically scaled down automotive tools with which I was familiar for doing similar jobs with cartridge repair. The way I get diamonds out of a cantilever without damage is the same way you get a ball joint out of a control arm. If you\u2019re a mechanic, you know what I mean. The way I wind a coil is the same way you rewind an alternator \u2013 just on a miniature level.\nLong is on eBay, fyi, where he\u2019s a cartridge hunter-refurbisher who sells his wares."

        "content": "If you shop for records, DJ equipment, HiFi equipment, or turntable accessories online, you\u2019ve probably spent some time on theTurntable Labwebsite. After more than 20 years, the online retailer has a global customer base who love their selection of products, and value their expertise and customer service. As a customer, I\u2019ve always been drawn to their music section that offers records you don\u2019t often see for sale on sites like Music Direct or Acoustic Sounds.\nFounderPeter Hahnis a very busy guy and constantly looking for new products for Turntable Lab\u2019s rather extensive global customer base. He\u2019s not afraid to take a flyer on some products that are TTL-branded concepts and many of them have proven to be very successful.\nBelow, Hahn explains how the company started and offers up some thoughts on the future of vinyl.\nHow did you get started and why?\nI was a working DJ in college (NYU, 90s) and kept having to buy mixers, Stanton styluses and replacement parts down on Canal Street. Coming armed with\u00a0price\u00a0research and\u00a0entering into\u00a0intense\u00a0haggling, I still ended up paying over the MSRP.\nAfter a while, I was the go-to help for other DJs who wanted to buy gear down there. I thought there had to be a better way to buy gear, so two of my college friends and I launchedturntablelab.comin my college apartment. We were one of the first DJ stores online and rode the early boom in turntablism (eg. Invisibl Skratch Piklz, X-ecutioners, DMC Battles).\nWhat were some of the biggest challenges starting and how did you overcome them?\nWe started the business when we were 21. Learning everything from scratch while bootstrapped has basically been our MO. Our first large order, which we celebrated, was fraudulent. We were calculating price margins wrong for the first couple of weeks. We had to break into the well established network of pro audio,\u00a0then HiFi. Our biggest challenge, however, has been\u00a0riding the huge market swings over the past 2 decades.\nWe\u2019re definitely in an excellent moment for vinyl right now, but we\u2019ve seen some dark days like CD supremacy, the introduction of Serato, opening a bi-coastal store at the start of the financial crisis, etc. Having to navigate those eras without macro know-how was extremely stressful and scary.\nWho is your typical customer?\nJudging by the type of records (emo-pop to esoteric) we sell and the price range of our turntables ($99 \u2013 $2,500), it\u2019s all over the place. However, we have an idea of the typical \u201cLabhead\u201d that helps guide us. A Labhead\u00a0has been following us for over 10 years; has DJ\u2019ed at one point (or still does); and collects multiple genres of records. I know a bunch of people who fit this profile and have been shopping with us close to 20 years.\nHow has Turntable Lab navigated the pandemic and what changes did you have to make in order to both navigate all of the rules in Brooklyn and keep up with demand?\nAll those challenges I mentioned before prepared us for the pandemic. I feel like in difficult business situations, it\u2019s inaction that will kill you. We took definitive action like closing the storefront early; creating and enforcing a safe workplace,\u00a0and upgrading our fulfillment to meet demand. Since the pandemic started, we\u2019ve doubled our warehouse space and doubled our shipping department. Luckily, we\u2019re located in the business-friendly Brooklyn Navy Yard. They\u2019ve been excellent in terms of balancing safety and productivity.\nWhat are some of your favorite products and why?\nHere are the items I\u2019m happiest to offer to customers:\nTechnics SL-1200MK7($999.99)\nOne of the happiest days in my life was getting my first pair of Technics (SL-1200MK2). I remember staying up all night playing with the motor and ogling\u00a0the S-shaped tonearm. I still have that pair, and have never needed any repair. We launched the business selling 1200s, so when they launched the MK7, it was like coming back full circle. Although I miss some of the visual cues of the original, the MK7 is a worthy successor.\nPro-Ject: Debut Carbon Evo($599)\nI\u2019m pretty sure Pro-Ject was our first HiFi account. We started with the Debut III in the early 2000s. As a dealer, you want consistency across models. Many manufacturers will kill a popular line or introduce new versions without much change. However with the Debut Series, the progression is very apparent. The one-piece carbon fiber tonearm was a game changer in terms of going against the OEM trend. With the Evo, I appreciate how they upgraded components they didn\u2019t necessarily have to upgrade like the feet, motor, and platter. When someone I know personally asks for a recommendation, this is usually the first model I\u2019ll recommend.\nClearaudio Concept($1,800)\nI\u2019ve been a Technics 1200 guy and I thought that would never change. There was a big mix-up in a shipment of Clearaudio turntables, and Garth (our Clearaudio distributor) ended up gifting me a Concept. That was my first high-end turntable and I was just amazed at how it would take static-y, blemished records and play them like they were mint. The way it tracked records was eye-opening.\nOrtofon 2M Blue($239)\nMy background is in design and I love to sell our customers on products that are modular. For me, the 2M Series was one of the first cartridge models that really pushed the idea of modular design. And at this price point, I also like how there\u2019s a definite noticeable upgrade in sound when you swap from Red to Blue.\nWhat do you use in your own system at home?\nI have a Technics SL-1200MK2, NAD integrated, Amphion speakers, and Line Phono Stand. I use a REVO Supersystem for listening to internet radio. Teenage Engineering OB-4 for portable listening.\nDoes it surprise you that vinyl has not only come back but become the #1 physical format again?\nNo. I was a hyper-consumer for most of my life. It\u2019s part of reason I came to live in New York. In the last\u00a05 years, I started to notice that there was less to buy for collectors like me. Bookstores were closing, toy quality was going in reverse, clothing / sneakers were pricing out. Over the last 5 years, vinyl has for the most part increased in quality while\u00a0remaining relatively affordable. There\u2019s more pressing plants doing better work.\nLabels are putting a lot of effort into packaging. Record stores are presenting the product better. Instagram is an excellent discovery tool. Discogs creates a fun, efficient market. Used record stores add the x-factor. Even colored vinyl, which was too soft / quiet pre-2010, is now very listenable.\nWhy do you prefer listening to records?\n30% = Listen to the entire album. 40% = Album artwork, liner notes, credits, label. 20% record shopping. 5% time/memory stamp. 5% ASMR.\nWhat is the most rewarding part of the job for you?\nA couple things. Now that I stopped collecting, I like to live vicariously through super-fans and collectors. For example, I tracked down the band TV Girl to do an exclusive run of their self-released album \u2018French Exit,\u2019 which was highly in-demand by fans. It was so cool to work directly with the artist and then seeing all our customers\u2019 reaction on Instagram when they received the record.\nSeeing how our team came together during this pandemic has been inspiring. There was a lot of uncertainty in the early days of the pandemic, and our warehouse crew stepped up immediately.\nLastly, running the business with one of my best friends has been especially fulfilling. After a whole work week together, we\u2019ll still meet up on a weekend with our kids.\nWhat are your 5 Desert Island Records?\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission."

        "title": "Ecoustics Selects: Audiophile Upgrades Under $300",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/audiophile-upgrades-under-300/",
        "content": "Audiophile publications have been on the receiving end of a lot of criticism over the past few years because of our focus on far too many components that most people can\u2019t afford. I would like to think that our focus on entry-level and mid-tier components and loudspeakers has positively changed the debate somewhat and I would push back and say that audiophile YouTube channels have actually done an excellent job introducing more affordable products to consumers that are actually rather good.\nThe \u201caffordability\u201d argument is a tricky one for the simple reason that everyone has a very different definition of that based on their own finances. I consider something like theBowers & Wilkins 703 S3that we justreviewedan aspirational loudspeaker option for myself at $6,000 USD. Others might view $400 loudspeakers from Wharfedale to be their ceiling \u2014 both of those are legitimate because the decision on what you want to spend is the only one that matters.\nBut are there upgrades that you can make under $300 that will pay off because the sonic performance exceeds what you might expect for the asking price? We think so.\nSome of the items are simple accessories that have made substantial differences for our staff of writers, whilst others are components that we take on the road with us or use on our desktops.\nThe little engine that could is tucked away in a suburb outside of Boston, and after almost 11 years, it is hard not to be impressed by what Ben Carter and the folks atU-Turn Audiohave accomplished.U-Turn Audiowas founded in 2012 by Benjamin Carter, Robert Hertig, and Peter Maltzan.\nHaving sold more than 120,000 turntables over that time period to a new generation of vinyl listeners and seasoned audiophiles looking for a secondary table, U-Turn Audio proved that it could be done.\nThe U-Turn Orbit was a great idea at the time, but the industry caught up and that forced them to develop necessary improvements to the existing design culminating in the the release of theOrbit Theoryin 2022.\nThe Orbit Theory was designed to compete with theRega Planar 3andPro-Ject Debut Proand at $999 falls well outside of our $300 ceiling.\nCan you get something from U-Turn Audio for $300? Indeed.\nThenew U-Turn Orbit Serieshas arrived and with new features such as a high-tech magnesium tonearm, electronic speed control, revamped drive system, and additional customization options.\nOrbit turntables incorporate modular design. This enables users to customize several turntable components such as the cartridge, preamp, speed control, platter, and isolation feet. This makes it easy for users to upgrade their turntable over time. TheOrbit Custom starts at $249and increases as options are added.\nThe new table is significantly better than the original offering much better speed stability, durability, and a superior tonearm.\nWhere to buy:$249at\u00a0uturnaudio.com\nA number of us have been listening to the standard FiiO FT3 and 32\u03a9 iteration and we have been rather surprised by the performance for under $300 USD.\nJust like theoriginal FiiO FT3, the FT3 32\u03a9 Edition is an open-back pair of headphones featuring large 60mm Dynamic Drivers, housed in an aluminum alloy shell that is both strong and lightweight, weighing in at just 391 grams.\nThe FT3 32\u03a9 model has proven to be extremely comfortable so far during its first week and the lower impedance has worked really well with an assortment ofDongle DACsanddesktop headphone amplifierson my desktop from FiiO, Schiit Audio, and Cambridge Audio.\nUnlike the standard FT3 that requires a lot of power and has an extremely neutral tonal balance and presentation (perhaps too neutral), the FT3 32\u03a9 is substantially easier to drive and is more responsive to DAC and amplifier changes. Is it an overly warm sounding headphone? Not really. But one can alter its low end thickness and tonal neutrality with a warmer sounding source.\nThe biggest surprise for us has been the soundstage width and imaging; the competition might have to go back to the drawing board in 2024 to reach this level of performance for under $300.\nBoth theFT3and FT3 32\u03a9 Edition both come supplied with a with a set of interchangeable connector plugs. Choose from 3.5mm and 6.35mm (single-ended) or 4.4mm and XLR-4 (balanced) \u2013 enabling these headphones to be enjoyed with everything fromDigital Audio Players (DAPs)and smartphones\nSupplied with 2 pairs of removable ear-pads \u2014 one pair suede, one pair leather \u2014 and a leather carry case.\nWhere to buy:$299at Audio46\nThe newC3GM bookshelf loudspeakersreplace the best-selling CG3 that were discontinued in 2022 and it\u2019s almost impossible to find a better pair of loudspeakers at the price;RSLsells all of their products direct to consumers and there is enormous value here for $210 USD/pair.\nThe C3GM work well on both stands or a desktop; the loudspeakers do not take up a lot of space (9.5\u201dH x 5.3\u2033D x 6.7\u201dW) and there is a keyhole mount for those who might wish to mount them on a wall and use them as rear channel speakers.\nThe 4-inch mineral-filled woven aramid fiber cone\u00a0woofer and 1-inch silk dome tweeter offer a fairly robust sound, but there is noticeable roll-off around 90Hz making theseideal candidate for a subwoofer.\nThe 86.5 dB (6 ohms) sensitivity is on the lower side but they will work just fine with 30-50 watts; and they certainly won\u2019t implode if you drive them with 100 to 125 watts of power either.\nA clean sounding pair of bookshelf loudspeakers with above average detail and speed considering the entry-level price tag.\nWhere to buy:$210/pair\u00a0at rslspeakers.com\nGrado does offer some rather expensive phono cartridges but the vast majority of its sales are below $300 and products like the Opus3 make one question why you need to spend a lot more; I have always believed that it makes more sense to buy a better table and use an overachieving cartridge like theGrado Labs Opus3,Denon DL-103,Nagaoka MP-110, orOrtofon 2M Bronzeinstead.\nThe Opus3 is nestled inside a Maple housing (8 grams) and I discovered that it sounded the best on my vintageYamaha YP-701and the replacement Ortofon LH-2000 Headshell that I ordered during the pandemic for another cartridge.\nThe cantilever is made from aluminum and the Opus3 uses an elliptical diamond stylus; mounting the cartridge was quite easy and I settled on a tracking force of 1.8 grams which was within the range but closer to the very top.\nGrado offers multiple versions of the Opus3 including the high output (4mV) version supplied, a low output model (1.0mV), and a mono version as well.\nThe Grado does vocals about as well as any $200 \u2013 $300 phono cartridge on the market and it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re listening to Amy Winehouse, Sarah Vaughan, Alison Moyet, Orville Peck, or Jason Isbell.\nPresence, tone, texture, and detail have to be present or it\u2019s just some flat rendition of something that doesn\u2019t engage you at all. The Grado Labs Opus3 succeeds in every way with the kind of vocals that I enjoy listening to and that makes it a keeper.\nIf your budget ceiling is $300, theGrado Labs Timbre Opus3is definitely a high-output cartridge to seriously consider.\nWhere to buy:$300at 4ourears\nHave you ever wondered where people on Instagram are getting those fantastic custom cork platter mats?\nThere\u2019s a company in New Jersey that makes them and how they got here is a bigger part of thestory.\nMost new tables come with cheap felt mats and older tables have dried up rubber mats that need to be replaced. Analog Restorations offers incredible custom cork platter mats that have ended up on thousands of platters in 2021 including 5 members of our team. They also offer cleaning wipes for your records that work really well on dirty records from garage sales and used record stores.\nWhere to buy:$35at AnalogRestorations.com\nFor more information:10 Questions for Analog Restorations\nThe level of performance from this $59 Dongle DAC makes this one of the easiest recommendations for this list.\nWith so many Dongle DACs on the market, it has become extremely difficult to find huge differences between the various models. It\u2019s usually at the top end of the market where the better models fromFiiOandQuestylehave demonstrated superior dynamic capabilities, higher levels of resolution, exceptional clarity and detail retrieval, and greater power reserves.\nThat level of performance comes with a much higher price tag.\nWith the exception of a volume issue with Android, this tiny dongle elevates the sound quality of the iPhone and Android-powered smartphones by a considerable margin and at a price that has to be considered a huge bargain.\nThis one easily makes our \u201cBest of 2023\u201d list in December for its overall performance below $100.\nWhere to buy:$59at iFi Audio\nRelated video:DAP, Dongle DAC or DAC-AMP: Which should you choose?\nSumiko offers an extensive lineup of both moving coil and moving magnet cartridges; a number of models come pre-installed on Pro-Ject tables being distributed in North America and there is a lot to like about the Rainier at under $150. This 5.0mV moving magnet cartridge is in the lower tier of the range and possibly the smoothest sounding of the bunch. The Rainier has excellent channel separation and tracks exceptionally well.\nThe design enables upgrading in the future to the Moonstone or Olympia stylus. The 6.5 gram weight makes it compatible with a lot of tonearms and it\u2019s not the hardest cartridge to mount.\nWhere to buy:$149at Turntable Lab\nIs it possible for a$219 network playerto really deliver a high-end digital playback experience?\nIn the case of theWiiM Pro Plus\u2014 the better answer is that one can elevate its performance long-term with a better DAC or amplifier on the other end and you are unlikely to feel that it can be bettered without spending a lot more money.\nFor$219 USD, the WiiM Pro Plus proved to be a real surprise. Linkplay put a lot of work into the app which worked better than some apps we\u2019ve tried with more expensive streamers and that definitely has to matter.\nThe incisive presentation and pacing worked better with richer sounding systems that require some additional clarity and top end presence and that certainly makes theWiiM Pro Plusa great option for vintage systems or loudspeakers with a darker presentation.\nWhere to buy:$219at WiiM\niFi Audio is celebrating its 10th anniversary with some exciting and affordable products including this excellent phono preamplifier that offers both MM/MC inputs. The iFi ZEN Phono is part of a much larger range that includes DACs, and headphone amplifiers and we\u2019ve been super impressed with the products that we have reviewed so far.\nDon\u2019t look at the price and think that it must have some serious shortcomings. We were quite surprised by how quiet it is and that it can handle almost any cartridge on the market; the iFi ZEN Phono offers 32dB to 72dB of gain. The neutral tonal balance and clarity make it a very strong option below $200.\nThe rear panel of the chassis includes a power input, balanced output (4mm), a gain switch with four positions, two RCA input jacks, two RCA output jacks, and a grounding terminal.\nWhere to buy:$199at iFi Audio\nSome cartridges fly under the radar because the brand doesn\u2019t get them into the hands of enough members of the press or because the price doesn\u2019t create enough buzz in comparison to rivals. Goldring have been in business almost as long as Danish rival, Ortofon, and that puts them in rather elite company.\nThe Goldring E Series are natural rivals to anything Audio-Technica and Ortofon have to offer below $300 and the E4 might best them all. I\u2019ve been listening for the past month (the E4 replaced both the Ortofon 2M Red andGolding E3on myNAD table) and it\u2019s not even close.\nTheGoldring E4is designed to be compatible with all medium-to-high-mass tonearms of the type found on the\u00a0majority of budget to midrange turntables.\nWhat\u2019s different about the new E4?\nThesuper-elliptical nude diamond stylusfeatures lower effective tip mass, and improved\u00a0rigidity, which should result in better high frequency detail retrieval than \u2018bonded\u2019 elliptical alternatives.\nThe E4 features a \u2018nude\u2019 super-elliptical stylus of just 7.6 x 18 microns (0.3 x 0.7 mil), which is cut and polished from a single homogeneous piece of diamond.\nTo complement its low tip-mass stylus, the E4 now features a hollow aluminum cantilever tube.\nThe Goldring E4 delivers a more open and neutral sounding presentation with a wider soundstage. It is also easier to sculpt into a very specific type of sound which will appeal to those who use vintage receivers or amplifiers, or entry-level integrated amplifiers below $1,000 than often veer to the darker side.\nCombine all of that with excellent speed, timing, and resolution and you have one of the best soundingentry-level phono cartridgesavailable below $300.\nWhere to buy:$299at GoldringUSA.com\nFor more information: Read ourGoldring E4 Review.\nThe story of theSR80xholds a special place for not only myself, but the ears of hundreds of thousands of listeners. The first pair was built in 1991 and the SR80x is worthy of being the longest running Grado headphone.\nMy first pair of audiophile-quality headphones were the Grado Prestige SR-80s and I schlepped them around the globe for almost 5 years. They vanished during the Second Intifada in Israel when I had to evacuate a bus in the Negev out of fear that a terrorist was trying to board a bus in the area.\nMy laptop bag was unattended for hours and when I finally got it back \u2014 the headphones were gone. I hope whomever took them enjoyed them; I had another pair in my suitcase.\nOne of my complaints about thePrestige Serieswas that the cable would kink a lot and I constantly had to untangle it. The new Grado Prestige X headphones utilize anew cable designoffering more durability and flexibility. Nylon-braided sheathing that prevents kinking and twisting.\nTheGrado SR80xalso utilize the new4th generation Grado 44mm driverswhich are specifically tuned for the SR80x; this new speaker design features a more powerful magnetic circuit, a voice coil with decreased effective mass, and a reconfigured diaphragm.\nWhere to buy:$125at 4ourears\nVinyl me this\u2026vinyl me that. Who is afraid of the big, black bat?\nCouldn\u2019t resist. And nor should some of you when it comes to the Andover Audio SpinStage Phono Preamplifier.\nTheAndover Audio SpinStagehas two key features not commonly found in budget phono preamplifiers. First, by\u00a0adding a separate MC gain stage with ultra-low-noise discrete transistors in a type of transconductance topology usually found only in more expensive designs, the SpinStage benefits from providing the necessary gain without added noise.\nSecond, the addition of an Auxiliary input restores the input used by the SpinStage when it\u2019s connected to an amplifier that has only a few inputs. For example, a system that includes a CD player or other device may need the input used by the SpinStage.\nThe MM section adds 40dB of gain, whilst the MC section offers 66.5dB for low output moving coil cartridges.\nPhono-cartridge resistive and capacitive loading optimize the SpinStage\u2019s high-frequency performance with any MM cartridge, while its ultra-high-precision resistors and capacitors deliver RIAA response typically accurate within \u00b10.2dB.\nThe SpinStage\u2019s selectable subsonic filter reduces the ultra-low-frequency noise of turntable rumble that can cause excess woofer pumping and waste amplifier power.\nYou can read myreview here, but let\u2019s cut to the chase.\nBetween the loading options, build quality, and surprisingly transparent and detailed presentation, Andover Audio has created one of the best affordable phono pre-amplifiers on the market. The bass could certainly have more impact and the DIP switches might be hard for some to read, but the performance for under $250 is excellent.\nWhere to buy:$249at andoveraudio.com\nIf you spend a lot of hours at your desk working all day, there is a strong possibility that you listen to music using headphones. You may even spend some of your lunch hour gaming to break up the monotony of the daily grind.\nThe DAC/headphone amplifier in your computer is not very good and why settle for less when you can significantly upgrade the sound quality with a hub like the Schiit Audio Hel+.\nThe newHel+is an upgrade over theHel 2which was introduced in 2021; The Hel 2 added more inputs and outputs for console users, and included a unique A-to-D mic to facilitate call taking on the computer or console while listening to music or gaming.\nAside from mic inputs, a USB interface, the Hel+ offers 1.5 watts of power (32 ohms) and an optical input. The front knob controls mic gain, with the larger knob on the top panel serving as the control for headphone volume levels.\nIt is a very clean looking hub that will let gamers like my son communicate more clearly with other gamers and also hear every last creeping opponent and incoming burst of gunfire with far greater detail and impact.\nWhere to buy:$199at schiit.com\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission."

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/technics-sl-1200gr2/",
        "content": "The turntable category continues to be a source of strong sales for Technics and strong motivator in regard to development of future models. The new SL-1200GR2 and SL-1210GR2 will not be available until December, but we expect these to sell out like their predecessors.\nReleased originally in 1972, theSL-1200featured a direct drive, high-torque motor, and has been used by millions across the globe to spin records, scratch, and DJ live music for almost 5 decades.\nTechnics has updated the SL-1200 more than a few times over the past decade including theSL-1200MK7PSand other variations.\nThat table featured the same direct-drive motor of theSL-1500Cwhich was designed to avoid issues such as clogging and speed control, plus a version of the company\u2019s long-running S-shaped aluminum tonearm.\nDo the new iterations feature mere cosmetic changes or has something really changed under the hood?\nTechnics has introduced\u00a0the\u00a0SL-1200GR2/SL-1210GR2, the\u00a0next\u00a0generation of the brand\u2019s Direct-Drive Turntable System.\u00a0This new model features a new drive control technique for smooth,\u00a0accurate\u00a0rotational stability and a new power supply for an exceptionally low noise floor.\nThe new models do not come equipped with a phono cartridge.\nInterestingly, Technics looked at how they have improved signal precision in their digital audio components, especially the reference amplifier SU-R1000, which optimizes vinyl analogue signals using complex digital technology. The goal was to advance their direct drive technology and integrate it into a new generation of turntables.\nHow did they do it?\nThis was achieved by reducing motor vibration through optimising the driving sine waves via the PWM signal generation using \u0394\u03a3 (Delta Sigma) Modulation, as employed in their full-digital amplifiers.\nThe motor control signal for the new SL-1200GR2/SL-1210GR2 is a huge leap in performance in comparison with earlier versions. Looking back to the 1970s, the motor control sine wave signal was generated by an analogue RF oscillator, the precision of which left room for smoother rotation.\nAfter the revival of the Technics SL-1200 turntable in 2016, the new SL-1200GAE \u2013 along with the much-improved motor by an iron-coreless stator \u2013 inherited a new motor control based on PWM for D/A conversion, using a micro controller including a sine-wave ROM.\nThis added remarkable impact on the whole rotational precision and helped achieving lower motor vibrations. However, despite this approach, the sine wave for motor control was still not 100% accurate.\nAlong with the motor control, the general power supply has also been the focus of engineering.\nThe new Multi-stage Silent Power Supply of the SL-1200GR2/SL-1210GR2 is a combination of a low-noise, high-speed power supply working at over 100kHz and a noise canceling circuit inherited from our reference class turntable SL-1000R, cancelling remaining noise by injecting the reversed-phase current of the actual noise.\nBy this method, a very low noise floor is achieved, enabling improved signal-to-noise ratio, improving the overall signal performance.\nMost of the mechanical design of the new GR2 type has been retained from its predecessor: Kept were the rather inert 2-layered bottom chassis made of aluminum and BMC (Bulk Moulding Compound), the combination of which enables high resistance against vibrations, the 2-layered platter made of aluminum and dampened by heavy-weight rubber, the high-sensitivity S-shaped aluminum tonearm and the effective insulator feet.\nThe\u00a0newly upgraded\u00a0turntable\u00a0is equipped with standout\u00a0audio and design\u00a0features,\u00a0including:\nThe Technics Direct-Drive Turntable System SL-1200GR2 (silver) and SL-1210GR2 (black) will be available at authorized Technics retailers\u00a0in\u00a0December\u00a02023 for$2,199.99.\nFor more information:technics.com\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission."

        "content": "The little engine that could is tucked away in a suburb outside of Boston, and after almost 11 years, it is hard not to be impressed by what Ben Carter and the folks atU-Turn Audiohave accomplished.U-Turn Audiowas founded in 2012 by Benjamin Carter, Robert Hertig, and Peter Maltzan.\nNortheastern University was the setting for a rather bold concept \u2014 could a start-up focused on building affordable turntables in the United States compete with Rega, Pro-Ject, and Audio-Technica?\nHaving sold more than 120,000 turntables over that time period to a new generation of vinyl listeners and seasoned audiophiles looking for a secondary table, U-Turn Audio proved that it could be done.\nThe U-Turn Orbit was a great idea at the time, but the industry caught up and that forced them to develop necessary improvements to the existing design culminating in the the release of theOrbit Theoryin 2022.\nThose improvements came with a rather steep uptick in price \u2014 the new table sells for $999 USD.\nConvincing your base to upgrade from $300 to $1,000 might be easier for a brand like Rega that also offers amplifiers, digital sources, and phono pre-amplifiers in the same price range, but it has always felt like a stretch for U-Turn.\nThe affordability of the Orbit was the key to its success and many of us wondered when the technology developed for the Orbit Theory would start to trickle down.\nThenew U-Turn Orbit Serieshas arrived and with new features such as a high-tech magnesium tonearm, electronic speed control, revamped drive system, and additional customization options.\nThe new Orbit line consists of four models:\nFrom Bob Hertig, U-Turn Audio co-founder and Orbit designer:\u00a0 \u201cOur mission is to make great analog audio more accessible,\u2026Over the last decade, we\u2019ve built and shipped hundreds of thousands of Orbits across North America and have earned a reputation for high-level performance and quality craftsmanship that doesn\u2019t break the bank. This new generation of Orbit represents a decade of experience, learning, and turntable development. We were able to take something that was already great and make it even better.\u201d\nOrbit turntables incorporate modular design. This enables users to customize several turntable components such as the cartridge, preamp, speed control, platter, and isolation feet. This makes it easy for users to upgrade their turntable over time. TheOrbit Custom starts at $249and increases as options are added.\nOA3 Tonearm: Included with all-new Orbit turntables, the OA3 tonearm is a single-piece magnesium arm tube that tracks records precisely with very little record wear, delivering a high level of musical detail. An adjustable counterweight and internal anti-skate are included.\nElectronic Speed Control: Orbit\u2019s new electronic speed control allows users to change between 33/45 RPM playing speeds with the turn of a knob. This option is available on the Orbit Special and Custom.\nRevamped Drive System: Orbit\u2019s new grooved platter designs, combined with an all-new seamless silicone belt, provides stable operation at the chosen speed.\nNew Colors and Hardwood Options: Orbit comes in a choice of five stunning colors and two hardwood options.

        "content": "If you\u2019ve never spent any time on HiFiShark while searching for used or vintage audio equipment, I suggest that you prepare yourself for what you might find. Chaos and a lot of disappointment when theexactamplifier you have been looking for appears but the owner is in Croatia. Hard pass on that one. I love Croatia as a country and go there on vacation every few years but I\u2019m not dropping $1,500 on some amplifier that I can\u2019t visually inspect; I\u2019m willing to drive 8-10 hours each way for something really special, but I\u2019ve had too many items not show up or arrive broken in pieces to do that again.\nOne of the most obvious pitfalls of any piece of vintage audio equipment is the availability of parts and someone qualified to fix or upgrade it. I\u2019m hesitant to recommend specific components if neither one of those scenarios is a possibility. Does it make sense to recommend the Aragon 4004 MKII or Audible Illusions Modulus 3A?\nIn my previous two installments, we recommended theVandersteen 1CiandMartinLogan reQuestloudspeakers because both brands still exist, offer comprehensive service and parts, and there is a lot of demand for both on the used/vintage audio markets. Both companies have been around for almost 40 years and are very successful.\nTheAragon 4004 MKIIhas not been in production for a few decades but the current ownership atIndy Audio Labsare superb audio engineers and doing a great job presently with Aragon and Acurus. Based on my experience, they are there to help Aragon 4004 MKII owners.\nWe recentlyreviewed the Acurus Muse A/V Processorand it\u2019s one of the best home theater products available; an aspirational piece of equipment for those of us who love watching movies in a dedicated home theater room.\nAudible Illusionsis also still in business and manufacturing high-end pre-amplifiers and power amplifiers. The brand flew under the radar for many years but has recently relocated from its factory in California to a new \u201cstate-of-the-art\u201d facility in Ormond Beach, Florida.\nThe company offers a completely new version of its famedModulus 3A pre-amplifiercalled the Modulus 3B. The prices have certainly increased over the past 20 years with the new model retailing for $5,400 USD.\nAudible Illusions also offers new tube sets for the Modulus 3A and service/repairs for a fee. I would highly recommend sticking with their parts and recommended tube sets based on hours of online research on various forums.\nSo why are we talking about these two specificvintage audio componentsthat will run you at least $2,500 on the used market?\nNew York Magazineran avery famous coverin 1990 featuring Mike Kay, the owner of Lyric Hi Fi and Video; the New York high-end audio institution closed permanently during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMike Kay passed away in 2012 leaving behind a very important legacy. Not only was Lyric Hi Fi one of the most influential stereo shops in the world launching many of the brands that have graced the covers of stereo magazines for decades, but it created a very high standard for the retailers that would emerge across the United States.\nThe Absolute Soundwould not exist had Mike Kay not convinced the late-Harry Pearson to launch his publication.\nI was 20 when I saw that cover on the newsstand in a bookstore in Dupont Circle and its impact on the rest of my life was not something that I was expecting.\nI remember flipping through the David Denby article and focusing on the stack of Aragon, Audible Illusions, California Audio Labs, andVPIcomponents.\nNone of this equipment was easy for me to find in Toronto or D.C. where I lived at the time, so I hopped on the train and made my way to New York City to visit Lyric and Sound by Singer.\nTheNew York Magazinearticle mentioned the more affordable Aragon 2004 and Audible Illusions Modulus 2B but my interest in the two brands was ignited.\nAndrew Singer standing behind a pair of MartinLogan CLS was like a drug for me. I wouldn\u2019t stop until I owned the speakers. 31 years have gone by and I\u2019m looking for my 6th pair of MartinLogan speakers \u2014 which will definitely be my last.\nThe bipolar side of my personality became obsessed with high-end audio equipment and my desire to spend all of my hard-earned money from 4 years of working 60 hours a week during the summer at my parent\u2019s pizzeria became a red flag for my family. Especially when I was attending a $30,000 per year college (1990) in a foreign country.\nThe Aragon 4004 MKII power amplifier was created by Mondial Designs; the short-lived design house owned by Dan D\u2019Agostino of Krell. The 4004 quickly became known as the \u201cpoor man\u2019s Krell\u201d for its bottomless pit of power and similar tonal balance. It was a heavy chunk of metal with a unique ventilation design and heatsinks.\nThe 200 watt per channel 4004 MKII contained two separate mono amplifiers in a single chassis and could drive almost anything.\nThe amplifier could double its output into 4 ohms and was ideal for MartinLogan electrostatic loudspeakers and the Magnepan models of the period.\nFor all of its brute power, the 4004 MKII could sound remarkably transparent and detailed with the right pre-amplifier and speakers.\nThe Modulus 3A was introduced in 1995 or 1996 and for a smaller brand, they were able to move a lot of product back in the day. Audible Illusions sold more than 15,000 all-tube pre-amplifiers during its first 15 years in business which is a lot for any high-end brand in 2021.\nThe Modulus didn\u2019t become very popular in the US until 1984 or 1985 and it took a series of very positive reviews before the brand began to get noticed by the high-end crowd in America.\nAudible Illusions was started by Art Ferris, a successful exporter of vintage McIntosh and Marantz gear to salivating customers in Asia. When the supply began to dwindle, he created the brand to satisfy the demand for American-made tube gear in Japan.\nFast foward to 1996 and the Modulus 3A was in heavy demand. The optional John Curl-designed MC phono stage was an option that many selected and was well worth the extra $500. If you\u2019re a fan ofParasound, you\u2019re very likely aware of John Curl\u2019s products.\nThe Modulus 3A\u2019s faceplate was a very substantial piece of metal that was 1/4\u2033 thick. The 4 control knobs were beautifully machined from aluminum. The ventilated top cover was secured with nicely finished hex-headed screws and easy to remove; something that was necessary to deal with the tubes that often blew well before their time.\nThe line stage portion of the Modulus 3A was excellent but the phono stage was on another level for a tube pre-amplifier in 1996 priced at $1,895. Definitely not inexpensive but it could compete with some of the best products of the period and was very well engineered.\nIf you\u2019re obsessed with measurements, the Audible Illusions Modulus 3A was near the top of the mountain for a pre-amplifier at the time. The power supply was housed in a separate chassis connected to the main unit with an umbilical cord.\nWhy should you bother trying to assemble a vintage system around these two components?\nSynergy.\nThe concept has not changed and putting these two excellent components together with the right pair of loudspeakers created an excellent stereo system in 1996 and would work just as well in 2021.\nThe Aragon 4004 MKII needs the warmth and resolution of the Modulus 3A and any of the pre-amplifier\u2019s shortcomings in the low end are quickly fixed by the intense slam and control of the 4004 MKII which delivered bass notes with authority, texture, and excellent pacing.\nTwo of the best components from the period and well worth the money today if the condition is excellent.\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission."

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/the-most-significant-turntables/",
        "content": "Almost 145 years have elapsed since Edison\u2019s Phonograph was patented.\nSince then, which turntables were truly significant? What technical capabilities and design features did they introduce?\nWe could easily publish a list of the \u201cbest\u201d turntables available right now but 99% of the planet could never afford them and will never have the opportunity to listen to one. This feels like a more interesting discussion.\nWe\u2019ve included some tables from the late 1900s and the first part of the 20th century because they were indeed, very significant\u2026\nThe Edison Phonograph, invented by Thomas Edison in 1877, is considered the earliest form of recorded sound playback. It used a cylindrical wax cylinder and a hand-cranked mechanism, laying the foundation for future turntable designs.\nIntroduced in 1906 by the Victor Talking Machine Company, this turntable became an iconic symbol of the early 20th century American music industry. It used a spring-driven motor to rotate a flat disc, and its signature \u201cHis Master\u2019s Voice\u201d logo became an enduring symbol of high-quality audio.\nThe Philips 212 Electronic, introduced in 1965, was one of the first commercially successful turntables to feature an electronic speed control mechanism. It marked a shift from manual speed adjustment to accurate electronic speed regulation, setting a precedent for future turntable designs.\nThe Garrard 301, introduced in 1954, was a breakthrough turntable known for its innovative idler-wheel drive system. It offered superior speed stability and became a benchmark for audio quality, influencing turntable design for years to come.\nIntroduced in 1961, the AR XA was only $58 and what made it unique was how it handled vibration and how low its rumble measured. The package did not come with a cartridge but the price included the table, tonearm, stylus gauge, and dustcover.\nThe most interesting aspect of the design was its mounting system; Edgar Villchur realized that instead of attaching the motor, tonearm, and lightweight platter to the table\u2019s top plate, it made more sense to mount the platter and tonearm to a sub platform which was suspended underneath the top plate at 3 very distinct points with damped springs with a low resonant frequency.\nBy doing so, the tonearm and record were isolated from footfalls and other acoustic vibration. Thorens and Linn would incorporate these concepts into their future tables.\nIn 1965, the Thorens TD 150, an inconspicuous little turntable, came on the market and thus started a technical revolution in record player manufacturing. For the first time, a spring-suspended sub-chassis with an inner platter driven by a flat belt was used in a mass-produced unit. The principle proved to be very successful and found many imitators in the years since.\nThe Thorens TD-124, released in the late 1950s, is highly regarded for its engineering excellence and advanced features. It featured a heavyweight platter, idler drive, a unique floating suspension, and a durable build, setting new standards for turntable performance and reliability.\nThe Technics SP-10, introduced in 1970, was a groundbreaking direct-drive turntable known for its exceptional speed stability and accuracy. It became popular among professional audio engineers and studios, setting a benchmark for precision playback.\nThe Linn LP12, introduced in 1972, played a crucial role in the resurgence of vinyl and the growth of the high-end audio market. It featured innovative suspension and vibration isolation techniques, setting new standards for turntable design and sound quality.\nThe Technics SL-1200, launched in 1972, is one of the most significant turntables in history. It revolutionized DJ culture and became the industry standard for its direct-drive system, rugged build quality, and precise pitch control.\nThe Rega Planar 3, first introduced in the 1970s and continuously refined over the years, became a symbol of simplicity, affordability, and excellent sound quality. It made high-quality audio accessible to a broader audience and became a popular choice among vinyl enthusiasts.\nThe Dual 1219, released in the 1970s, was one of the first turntables to incorporate automatic features such as auto-start, auto-stop, and automatic tonearm return. It introduced convenience and automation to the turntable market, shaping the future of consumer audio.\nThe Pro-Ject Debut Carbon, introduced in the late -1990s, played a crucial role in making high-quality turntables more affordable and accessible. It offered impressive sound quality and build quality at a budget-friendly price, attracting a new generation of vinyl enthusiasts."

        "content": "Planar magnetic headphoneshave been the tip of the spear during the Head-Fi revolution and you are more likely to find consumers who have heard of the technology because of the exponential growth of the high-end headphone market versus those who have experienced planar or ribbon loudspeakers.\nEdward W. Kellogg and Chester W. Rice are credited with inventing the first ribbon loudspeaker while they were working at General Electric in 1924. They discovered that a thin metal ribbon suspended in a magnetic field could be used to produce sound waves, and this design has been refined and improved upon over the decades.\nDr. Oskar Heil was also a pioneer when it comes to ribbon loudspeakers in the 1930s. Heil was a German physicist and inventor who was interested in developing new types of loudspeakers that could produce high-quality sound across a wide frequency range. Heil\u2019s design used a thin strip of metal foil suspended in a magnetic field to produce sound.\nThe ribbon loudspeaker was initially used in military and industrial applications, but it later became popular in high-end audio systems due to its ability to reproduce sound with exceptional clarity and detail.\nAudiophiles have enjoyed the benefits of planar/ribbon loudspeakers for almost 50 years, and many of us have owned loudspeakers created byMagnepan, Eminent Technology, Infinity, andApogee Acoustics. New brands likeDiptyqueandClarisys Audioare offering new ribbon designs that offer even more impressive performance.\nRibbon tweeters have become extremely common and one can find them in loudspeakers manufactured by Quad,MartinLogan, Adam Audio, Emotiva, Aperion, andMonoprice.\nLike other planar loudspeakers (electrostatic), planar magnetic loudspeakers use a flat diaphragm to produce sound. However, instead of using an electrostatic charge to move the diaphragm, planar magnetic drivers use a magnetic field.\nThe diaphragm is suspended between two rows of magnets, and when an electrical signal is applied to the voice coil, it interacts with the magnetic field to move the diaphragm and produce sound.\nThe diaphragm is usually made of a thin film or foil material, such as Mylar or Kapton, and is mounted between two sets of magnets, one on either side of the diaphragm.\nPlanar magnetic drivers are known for their ability to produce accurate, detailed sound with low distortion. They can reveal subtle nuances in music and reproduce complex sounds with clarity.\nWhen an electrical signal is applied to the conductive trace pattern, a magnetic field is created that interacts with the magnets and causes the diaphragm to move, producing sound waves. The movement of the diaphragm is much more precise and controlled than in traditional cone drivers, which can lead to improved clarity and detail in the sound.\nPlanar magnetic loudspeakers are known for their ability to produce very accurate, detailed sound with low distortion.\nRibbon and planar magnetic loudspeakers also features a dipole radiation pattern, which means that the sound is radiated equally from both the front and the back of the speakers. This results in a more spacious and natural soundstage, as the sound is not confined to a single direction.\nHowever, they can be more expensive to manufacture than traditional cone drivers, and they may require more power to drive than other types of loudspeakers. Additionally, planar magnetic loudspeakers can be quite large and heavy, which can make them difficult to install in some environments.\nPlanar magnetic loudspeakers offer several advantages over other types of loudspeakers:\nWhile planar magnetic loudspeakers offer several advantages, they also have some disadvantages to consider, including:\nOverall, planar magnetic loudspeakers are a specialized type of loudspeaker that can offer superior sound quality in certain applications, but they may not be the best choice for every listener or environment.\nIt\u2019s important to consider the specific needs and requirements of your audio system when deciding whether to invest in planar magnetic loudspeakers.\nHere is a list of some ribbon/planar loudspeakers or models that utilize a ribbon driver technology.\nNote that this is not an exhaustive list and there are many other ribbon loudspeakers available from various manufacturers.\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission."

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/quadraphonic-rhino-kevin-milligan/",
        "content": "Over the past five years, a growing number of specialized labels or sublabels have cropped up whose mission is to produce limited-run, no-expense-spared represses of classic albums. Created for audio obsessives whose quest for perfect vinyl copies of their favorite records has less to do with original pressings than with optimal sound, labels like Music Matters, Acoustic Sounds, and Electric Recording Company seem to have taken cues from the art and book collectors\u2019 markets, where rarity and quality combine to create bliss (and value). The Tone Poet/Blue Note Classic series, Acoustic Sounds/Impulse/Verve series, Craft\u2019s Original Jazz Classics reboot are a few examples of such endeavors.\nA few months ago Rhino, the archival arm of Warner Music, issued the first two records from its new Rhino High Fidelity imprint. Devoted to producing remarkable albums from Warner\u2019s massive trove of recordings, Rhino High Fidelity\u2019s initial releases are at opposite ends of the musical spectrum: John Coltrane\u2019sColtrane\u2019s SoundandThe Cars, the debut album by the Boston new wave band. \u201cThese high-end, limited-edition vinyl reissues of classic albums represent the pinnacle of sound and packaging,\u201d boasts the label on its website.\nThe curatorial driver of Rhino High Fidelity is Rhino senior director of A&R\u00a0Patrick Milligan, who took time to hop on a call to discuss the imprint. Too, Milligan talked about Rhino\u2019s new Quadio initiative, which has been mining the Warner archives for recordings, mostly from the 1970s, released in quadraphonic (four-channel) sound. The below conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing: What was the reasoning behind the launch of Rhino High Fidelity?\nPatrick Milligan: Rhino Hi-Fi came about because we\u2019ve obviously licensed material over the years to Mobile Fidelity, Acoustic Sounds, Electric in the UK \u2013 they do these $300, limited to 300-copies kind of things. We\u2019ve never really done that, and we thought we should maybe try to get in that lane.\nIt was first suggested to me that we consider doing half-speed masters, and I\u2019ve always been a little bit ambivalent about that because a lot of mastering people I talked to feel like you take a tape and you\u2019ve got something at a low frequency that reproduces at normal speed, but when you slow it down to half-speed, those low frequencies don\u2019t reproduce so you lose low and you probably gain some detail in other areas.\nBut when I found out that the current process of half-speed mastering is digital, I just didn\u2019t want to go that route. So we decided, \u201cWe\u2019ll amplify what it is that makes the good records that we do great\u201d \u2013\u00a0 like mastering and cutting lacquers from original analog tapes, and using Kevin Gray, who I think is one of the few mastering engineers that everybody seems to know because his work is so respected, and people are anxious to get anything that he\u2019s cut.\nWe do other albums and we typically cut from tape when we can, so it\u2019s not like we don\u2019t do that in other projects. And we do use Kevin on other projects, too. But for this, we just thought, \u201cWell, what if we control every aspect of this to be the highest quality \u2013 use the tapes, use Kevin Gray, and we press these at Optimal?\u201d\nWhy Optimal?\nI know people are very opinionated about pressing plants, and we use a variety of pressing plants. I think we all feel like Optimal is certainly the most consistent, really quiet, clean, pressings. They just get it. It\u2019s in Germany. There are US plants that are very revered and probably equally as good, but Bernie Grundman has told me several times he thinks that Optimal is the best pressing plant. I know Kevin Gray had mentioned that, certainly in terms of European pressing plants, Optimal is pretty much top of the game. So for us, it\u2019s a consistency thing. And I think it shows in these records. We\u2019re doing 180-gram and we decided that we were going to elevate the packaging to be as nice as it could be. They\u2019re super heavyweight, tip-on, glossy, gatefold jackets.\nYeah, they make this satisfying cracking sound when you open the gatefold for the first time.\nExactly, yes. Very old school. We\u2019re reproducing all the original artwork. Not to get too geeky, but in the case ofThe Cars, since there was an inner sleeve in the original record, we made that the gatefold art since the original album was a single album. And for Coltrane, which also was not originally a gatefold, we got a really beautiful photo that was used as a promo photo for Atlantic in the day.\nThat's a great photo.\nYeah, yeah, it\u2019s fun to find ways to make the packaging as nice as we can. Another thing I\u2019m particularly proud of because I\u2019m a real tape- and a tape-box-geek, we were like, \u201cLet\u2019s add an insert and reproduce the tape box so people can see the actual tape that this record was cut from,\u201d so you kind of have your own copy of the tape, in a way. Inside the insert, we\u2019ve got notes for each of these release \u2013 notes that are from somebody involved in the actual sessions talking about an aspect of making the record.\n\u201cWith Quad, it\u2019s psycho acoustics\u2026 You can put something acoustically centered in almost a 3D way, because you\u2019ve got that soundscape sense.\u201d\nFor the Coltrane record, literally everybody involved in that session is no longer with us. But we were fortunate enough to have had producer Tom Dowd write a little bit about the Coltrane sessions for us when we did the Atlantic CD box. It\u2019s a nice piece. He really describes what it was like to edit an Atlantic Coltrane session, how Coltane would come in and simply play for a long time before everybody else showed up to establish the mood of the session.\nThe goal is presenting somebody an opportunity to get inside the making of the record and what makes these records sound so great. Hopefully that\u2019s a nice add-on for people, too. I\u2019m super proud of how they turned out, and I\u2019m also really thrilled with the response that we\u2019ve gotten. It\u2019s been all very positive, and we\u2019ve already sold out ofThe Cars. That took us all by surprise.\nThey're beautiful sets and they sound amazing.\nThank you. When you get in the hi-fi lane, that\u2019s a critical audience. If it didn\u2019t turn out great, it could really blow up in your face.\nThe Cars and Coltrane are obviously two very different kinds of records. Is there any sort of connective tissue for the imprint going forward other than just awesome stuff from the Warner archives?\nWe can get creative with it. When we planned these first two, we had another title with The Cars, and we decided at the last minute to change it up because we thought well, let\u2019s have a little variance. I think the jazz audience intersects with audiophiles to some degree, and certainly some of the Blue Note albums have really resonated with that audience. So we just thought, Coltrane is certainly the gem of our jazz catalog. I had a few higher-ups at our company who asked, \u201cWhy this and notGiant StepsorMy Favorite Things? I said \u201cWe\u2019ve done versions ofGiant StepsandMy Favorite Thingsthat recently we expanded for the high fidelity lane.\u201d I just felt, \u201cLet\u2019s not do something that\u2019s been done to death.\u201d\nI\u2019m a big Coltrane fan, and I\u2019ve always really lovedColtrane\u2019s Sound. I think that because it came out after he left Atlantic, people maybe think it is not a real record, but it is basically from sessions from the same time. I\u2019ve talked to several people that feel the same way. It\u2019s like, \u201cEquinox,\u201d that\u2019s one of the best Coltrane songs ever. So I\u2019m glad that a lot of people got that. This is a record that needs to be championed. It gets overlooked and it\u2019s great sounding.\nKevin Gray is in high demand and super busy and it\u2019s tough to schedule time with him sometimes. But I called him on Thursday, and I said, \u201cHey, any chance you could cut a Coltrane record for me by Tuesday?\u201d He said yeah, he knew the tape. He told me later, \u201cYou know, I did that because it was Coltrane.\u201d I said, \u201cYeah, it was kind of counting on that.\u201d\nYou've got Ornette Coleman's catalog too, right?\nWe do.\nThere you go. Good.\nWe\u2019ll just leave it at that. [Laughs.]\nI'm looking at that beautiful Coleman CD box right now in my office that Atlantic put out, Beauty is a Rare Thing.\nYeah, I worked on that project. When we did the Atlantic jazz catalog, I worked really closely with Joel Dorn when we first launched. It was really fun to work with him, but that particular Ornette Coleman set was a passion project, and a cool one for people there at Atlantic.\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping with Rhino High Fidelity that people will take a chance on something. Like, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t really know this record, but if it\u2019s in this format it\u2019s probably going to be fun to hear.'\u201d\nHonestly, I don\u2019t know much about Rhino\u2019s new Quadio initiative. I was thinking it was along the lines of Dolby Atmos, but it\u2019s focused on quadraphonically recorded albums.What's Quadio?\nQuad was four speakers, two front and two rear. If you have a home theater system, it basically puts two in front and two in rear, just like Quad would be.\nIt\u2019s interesting you mentioned Atmos. We\u2019ve gone through several eras and different kinds of immersive audio. As you probably recall, in the early 2000s the SACD and 5.1 immersive audio never really resonated and took off. But if you hear stuff in the format, it can be very impressive. I think it\u2019s always been difficult to communicate to consumers just exactly what it is. Certainly audiophiles or people more in-the-know who might have invested in those systems love it. But like I always said about 5.1 when they were really pushing it, we\u2019re entering into an era when people are getting iPods and little headphones. They\u2019re not sitting in a sweet spot in a room listening to a home theater system. And I have a home theater system and I had a 5.1 system and some of that stuff is incredible. If you\u2019ve heard it, it\u2019s really beautiful.\nAtmos has a little bit better chance because it\u2019s been adopted by Apple and Tidal and people like that. For Apple, it\u2019s very much about hearing it in headphones. If you really get to hear Atmos in a room that\u2019s Atmos equipped, it\u2019s impressive. Atmos Dolby has a Theater in Hollywood where they do demos \u2013 it\u2019s a small movie theater, basically. And it has I don\u2019t know how many \u2013 48 or 60 \u2013 speakers all the way around like a movie theater. Then to go into a studio that\u2019s Atmos-equipped is also super impressive. Most people don\u2019t get that opportunity. With Quad [quadraphonic sound] there seems to be a really fierce fan base of original Quad records and several websites and databases and things like that.\nSo all of the releases are from that same Quadraphonic era of the 1970s?\nYeah, Quad became a format basically from 1971 to 1976, and I can tell you two that there were things that were mixed in the format that didn\u2019t end up getting released. We have some of that stuff in the library and we may end up doing some of that at some point. But it\u2019s authentic to the original format.\nWe have it set up in the office and I\u2019m telling you, I\u2019ve heard these amazing Atmos mixes \u2013 Atmos is really spatial because if you mix, it\u2019s object-based so you can move things around in a pretty amazing 3D atmosphere. And because there are speakers up top and on the side, you can move sounds around. With Quad, it\u2019s psycho acoustics. Like with stereo, you\u2019ve got left and right and then you\u2019ve got something in the middle when you combine the two. That applies to Quad, too. You can put something acoustically centered in almost a 3D way, because you\u2019ve got that soundscape sense.\nSteve Woolard, one of my A&R colleagues at Rhino, is an audio enthusiast and he\u2019s always been kind of a Quad fanatic. And over the years Rhino has tried a few different things. When Rhino Handmade was still going, there was a greatest hits album of Aretha Franklin\u2019s that was only ever Quad released. It had some unique versions of songs and stuff like that. They put that out but it really didn\u2019t do that well. A few other things were done \u2013 The DoorsBest ofthat Bruce Botnick mixed in Quad back in the day was included on a Blu-ray.\nThe other significant things were that Steve realized that the band Chicago had their first nine albums \u2013 other than the live album \u2013 all in Quad, which is by far the most Quad albums any artist ever had. He put together a box that calledQuadioand it\u2019s all of those albums on Blu-ray in a beautiful box that all reproduced exactly as the original albums were, with the posters and the embossed covers and things like that and it\u2019s really beautiful. They did a run of that just to try it and it sold through almost immediately. So they did another one and it sold through.\nThen, just around the time I came back to Rhino at the end of 2018, we did the Doobie Brothers that way \u2013 they had four albums in Quad \u2013 so we did a Quad box and that sold through. It occurred to me that like this Quad thing really resonates, at least on our website where we can sell direct to consumers. People seem to know about these and follow the Quad sites and immersive sites. So I suggested that we consider doing some individual titles and start a series.\nThose just came out, right?\nWe just launched the first four, Black Sabbath,Paranoid, Alice Cooper\u2019sBillion Dollar Babies, J. Geils\u2019Nightmares and Other Tales\u2026, and Jefferson Starship\u2019sRed Octopus. We did those all individually and the response has been unbelievable. I think people are a fan of the format and it\u2019s a little bit like the high-fidelity thing. It caters to an audiophile and I think there are a lot of people that are fans of the format. I\u2019m hoping with Rhino High Fidelity that people will take a chance on something. Like, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t really know this record, but if it\u2019s in this format it\u2019s probably going to be fun to hear.\u201d"

        "title": "Now is a very good time to buy a vintage CD player. Where to start?",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/vintage-cd-player/",
        "content": "For decades, the main format-facing argument between analog freaks and their CD-loving counterparts revolved around the sound quality, analog warmth, and soulful essence of vinyl vs. the clean, crisp clarity of digital discs.\nLong a polarizing either/or beef, it seems pretty obvious at this point that listening tastes and personal preferences can be just as important as quantitative, provable data. As such, over the past few years the bickering among physical format enthusiasts has begun to recede. Vinyl rules. Cassettes rule. And, honestly, if the obviously imperfect cassette format can rule, then why can\u2019t CDs rule alongside them both?\nThose looking for 1990s rarities, after all, don\u2019t have much of a choice when it comes to format: it\u2019s either disc or nothing, as many labels stopped making vinyl during the decade and a lot of great music has yet to land on streaming services.\nIf it seems as though we\u2019re qualifying our devotion to vinyl, you need to find more space in your heart. Propelling magical sound waves into the air is the goal.The warmth resides within.\nAll of this is a roundabout way of getting to this point: CD players are an incredibly useful component to add to your arsenal, and since 95% of those who owned a CD player during the format\u2019s heyday got rid of theirs, the market is dense with quality players \u2014 at least for now. It\u2019s a similar environment as the pre-vinyl-revival era of the 1990s. The same goes for CDs themselves: used copies remain cheap but prices are started to rise. They will continue to do so.\nBelow, some favorites.\nWhat Marantz says about the iconic player, originally manufactured in 1982:\nReleased in the fall of 1982, the original Marantz Model CD-63 was one of the first mass-adopted CD players in the marketplace \u2014 and its details and craftmanship are cherished and reverberate throughout audio equipment to this day. According to historian and aficionado @MarantzHistory, \u201cthe CD-63 screams the 1980s.\u201d\nWith its top-loading design and signature champagne color, the CD-63 immediately stood out for its refined appearance and unmatched performance. Features of the CD-63 are engraved on the player, including a paragraph on the advantages of digital sound. Its display includes 15 LED lights, one per track on most CDs. If the CD had more tracks, skipping was impossible.\nOne audio expert of the day had this to say about the Harman/Kardon HD760, which he called \u201ca very good sounding player, 3D soundstage with 24 bits HDCD and 4\u00d720 bits converters for a clear sound with voices and every kind of music.\u201d Describing it as \u201cvery jitter free and quick responding as you skip tracks,\u201d he calls it \u201cthe best sounding player [for the price] I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d The H/K has a standby function, both coax and optical outputs, and gold-plated cinch outputs. The display has a dimmer for nighttime listening.\nFound on used gear sites for between $200-$300.\nFrom the Tascam site:\nThe TASCAMCD-601mkIIis a fully-redesigned version of the radio-standard CD player. With its comprehensive remote control and flexible monitoring and playback options, the CD-601mkII goes far beyond the capabilities of traditional CD players for broadcast. The radio presenter can select between online play (on the air) and monitor play (pre-listen), controlling whether CD playback reaches the on-air mixer or the monitoring device.\nThe optionalRC-601mkIIremote control (above right) allows frame-accurate search using the jog wheel, direct location using numerical keys, index searches or flash starts. In addition, the CD-601mkII can save up to 10 cue points per CD, controlled directly using the Flash Start function. Many other features like pitch control, auto cue with five threshold levels, Auto Read and CD Text are all designed to reduce stress before the program goes on the air.\nThese players aren\u2019t too hard to find for under $200, though they don\u2019t come up as often as the brilliant Tascam CD-200, whose secret weapon is a pitch control.\nThe TikTok-famous player has found fans due to its top-loading design and transparent window, which allows you to see the disc load and spin. Currently available for under $400 on eBay, it\u2019s not that hard to find one in good condition. It\u2019s got RCA outputs so you can add it to your system. Also covetable: Anice Sony CMT-ED1\nKnown for their durable top-of-the-line cassette decks, Nakamichi invested just as much time and energy into their compact disc players during the peak CD era.\nOne audiophile describes it as having a digital-audio-converter that\u2019s \u201cone of the best in the world: the TDA1541A S1 CROWN. These chips alone go for a few hundred dollars today\u2026 It blows away most DACs and players under $1,000 and has ZERO harshness or grain, yet is extremely organic and detailed from top to bottom. The bass slam and depth is something to marvel at, as are the dynamics overall. This blew away my Denon 2560, 3520, Cambridge 640, Schiit Bifrost Uber, Nuforce UDAC, Audioquest Dragonfly, Marantz CD94 and Nakamichi OMS-7.\u201d\nEasily found for under $250.\nAs notedin a reviewon the Hi-Fi audio site Hi-Fi Classic, the Quad CD 66 was manufactured to pair with the Quad 66 preamplifier, and a remote control is required to work the CD player minus the preamp. Per Hi-Fi Classic, \u201cthe player\u2019s entire display window is the size of the preamplifier\u2019s volume/balance display, and it normally shows only the current track and index numbers and the elapsed time on the track. It also shows pause and error indications when appropriate as well as the letter p beside the track number in programmed operation. Right after a disc is loaded, the display shows its total playing time and total tracks.\u201d\nOne crucial thing to know about CD players is that their innards were manufactured by only a few corporations who, in turn, sold the same devices to whoever was building players. Which is to say, sometimes the only difference between players made by competitors is the shell and digital display.\nQuad\u2019s innards were made Philips, who introduced compact discs to the market. Per Hi-Fi Classic: \u201cThe digital portion of the player uses quadruple oversampling at 176.4 kHz along with a digital filter and dual 16-bit digital-to-analog (D/A) converters. The rear apron contains a coaxial digital output, the two analog outputs, and input/output jacks for use with an RC-5 multiroom controller. There is no power-output socket, since in a full Quad system the CD player would be at the end of the power chain.\u201d\nThese are pricier than others here: It\u2019s not easy to find one for under $800 right now.\nHere\u2019s what Stereophilehad to sayabout the Rega Planet CD upon its release in 1997:\nRega is the last major UK specialty house to produce a CD player. They are the \u201clast adopters.\u201d You know Rega\u2019s attitude toward digital when you read the poop sheet they send out to dealers and distributors: \u201cThe Planet is a small analogue oasis in a digital world and will appeal to people who love music but have to or want to listen to the CD medium.\u201d\nRega has engineered this CD player to give a sound and an operational feel close to analog. Playing discs on the $795 Rega Planet is a lot like playing LPs: You can read the CD label as the disc sits inside the player, and you can see the disc spin as it plays.\nThe Planet is a top-loader, which presents a problem if you need to squeeze your CD player into a tight space. You can\u2019t stack anything on top of the Rega Planet; you need at least 5\u2033 of clearance between the top of the player and the bottom of the next shelf. Better yet, put the Rega Planet on a top shelf. (Avoid placing the player on a veneered table or shelf; the gummy foot-suspension material could stick to the surface and lift the finish. Cut out a piece of cardboard and wedge it under each foot. Or put the player on a sheet of plate glass.)\nGrab one of these now for about $350. In five years they\u2019ll cost twice that.\nThis is not a joke.Check this Instagram.\nCommenter in post: \u201cWhat makes it great?\u201d Budget Audiophiler: \u201cThe DAC used in this model and the cost.\u201d\nEasily found for under $200.\nHere\u2019s what the respected audio reviewer Leonard Feldman had to say about this 1984 production:\nIt comes as no surprise to me that this first Compact Disc player to be built by Studer-Revox is one of the most sophisticated, rugged, yet easy-to-use units of its kind that I have ever tested. After all, Studer and Revox tape equipment is used in broadcast and recording studios throughout the world, and Revox products (the brand name used on Studer\u2019s consumer products) are regarded by many to have the same attributes as the company\u2019s professional components. What did surprise me was the suggested retail price of the unit. I had fully expected the Revox CD player to be among the world\u2019s most expensive as well as among the world\u2019s best. While it certainly lived up to the latter expectation, its price was no higher than that on some of the first-generation CD players which offered only a fraction of this unit\u2019s versatility.\nThese are skyrocketing in value. Currently going for about $700."

        "title": "McIntosh\u2019s ML1 MKII Loudspeaker Delivers Modern Sound From A Vintage Design",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/mcintosh-ml1-mkii/",
        "content": "Vintage Audiohas become a huge trend in the high-end space; loudspeaker companies including Klipsch, PSB, Mission, KLH, JBL, and Wharfedale have successfully introduced modern iterations of some of their most popular loudspeakers from the past fifty years. McIntosh is joining that list with the launch of its latest speaker, theML1 MKII.\nTheMcIntosh ML1 MKIIis a unique loudspeaker where vintage style meets contemporary sound. It\u2019s made in the USA and said to be reborn with a similar bass response as the initial version but without the need of an equalizer.\nThe ML1 MKII can be connected with amplifiers up to 600 Watts to fill the largest of rooms with life-size sound. It also featureswide dispersion, which allows for an equal distribution of sound throughout the listening area.\nThe external design of the ML1 MKII retains the same charm as the original ML1 with its oiled American Walnut solid wood cabinets and satin finish veneers. Whereas, internally, it features a full modern revamp to reflect McIntosh\u2019s present-day high performance speaker technology. The ML1 MKII is a4-way speaker that uses five separate speaker driversto produce a uniform listening area and highly resolved sound quality.\nUnlike the original ML1, the drivers on the new generation ML1 MMKII arepositioned symmetricallyso there is not a dedicated left and right speaker, eliminating the possibility of installing the speakers in the wrong orientation, and providing a more uniform listening area.\nAspecially milled transition platehouses the midranges and tweeter and allows them to be placed close together. Their close proximity to each other reduces off axis lobing of the sound field and places all the acoustic output that typically impacts imaging together in a small space. The transition plate also provides a strong foundation for the upper frequency units to reduce vibrations that might affect the sound. Internal cabinet bracing provides an airtight and separated enclosure from the 12\u2033 woofer to further minimize vibrations.\nThe upper midrange in the ML1 has low resonance and high-power handling capabilities; this allows the crossover point between the lower and upper midranges to avoid the 1kHz frequency that is critical to producing clear vocals. The crossover frequency of the tweeter reduces vertical lobing of the sound field and allows the ML1 to reproduce the recorded music more faithfully.\nWith its12\u2033 woofer, the ML1 has an incredible bass response down to 30Hz, which is close to the lowest frequency the human ear can detect. A subwoofer will typically not be needed to achieve deep, punchy bass. You might see some similarly sized speakers with more woofers, but don\u2019t be deceived by a higher woofer count as there is no substitute for woofer size. In fact, the single 12\u2033 woofer in the ML1 has the same surface area as four 6\u2033 woofers \u2013 and when it comes to the bass frequencies that a woofer produces, the larger the surface area the better to push all that air.\nThe 12\u2033 woofer has been designed to work in anacoustic suspension design enclosure, just like the original. However, much has been learned since the original ML1 speaker, and modern design and simulation tools were used to develop design parameters that provide a bass response similar to the original but without the need for an external equalizer. The woofer also uses McIntosh\u2019s patented Low Distortion High Performance (LD/HP\u00ae) Magnetic Circuit Design that significantly reduces distortion while increasing power handling and efficiency. The performance improvements from LD/HP are so vast that the 12\u2033 woofer in the ML1 could rival woofers twice its size.\nThe ML1 uses acustom-built crossover networkdesigned by McIntosh engineers for performance and durability. Over-specified components ensure high power handling, while solid state, self-resetting protection devices prevent damage to any of the drivers. The crossover design separates the high and low frequency circuits, and each are available both bi-wiring or bi-amping as desired. All the power sent to the ML1 from your amplifiers is fed through McIntosh\u2019s Solid Cinch\u2122\u00a0speaker binding posts that easily but securely attach the\u00a0speaker cables\u00a0to prevent them from coming loose and possibly causing a short. The binding posts are gold-plated to prevent corrosion and ensure a quality signal is sent through your speaker cables.\nLastly, the ML1 comes with a matching stand that features a vintage die cast aluminum name badge on the base that matches the badges found on some of McIntosh\u00a0amplifiers\u00a0and\u00a0integrated amplifiers.\nThe stand is designed to elevate and position the ML1 loudspeaker for optimum imaging and listening enjoyment. It comes with feet for use on hard floors, and spikes for use on carpet. The reimagined loudspeaker can also be set directly on the floor or placed on a sturdy piece of furniture.\n\u201cWhile we have been making loudspeakers for over five decades, the ML1 will always be our first and holds a special place in our hearts here at McIntosh,\u201d said McIntosh President Charlie Randall. \u201cWe\u2019re incredibly excited to showcase how far the brand has come over the more than half a century with the renewed ML1 and hope our community of listeners will enjoy listening to their favorite sounds on this classic remodel.\u201d\nThe McIntosh ML1 MKII loudspeaker will be available for USD$12,000 per pairthrough Authorized McIntosh Dealers starting July 2023.\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission."

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/audio-technica-ath-m50x/",
        "content": "In the early 1950s, a 32-year-old audio afficiando named Hideo Matsushita landed a job at Tokyo\u2019s Bridgestone Museum of Art \u2013\u2013 now called the Artizan Museum \u2013\u2013 after an introduction from a relative. The museum, located in the central part of the city, had opened a few years earlier to house its wealthy founder\u2019s art collection, but the complex also programmed film screenings, lectures, and recitals.\n\u201cAt the urging of the museum\u2019s director,\u201d Matsushita recalled in an archivalinterview, \u201cI began organizing LP concerts. These were much more successful than anyone imagined.\u201d Those public sessions were presented on gear from the soon-to-be center of the global hi-fi movement, which was then starting to produce components for high-end customers. Matsushita was excited by the response but frustrated that high-fidelity listening was cost-prohibitive for the masses. So in 1962 he struck out on his own and established an audio company called Audio Technica. It\u2019s aim was to bring great sound to The People.\ntl;dr version: The multimillion-dollar audio company Audio-Technica was born after a series of listening sessions.\nAdded the Audio-Techica founder of the beginnings: \u201cThe company immediately launched its first product, the AT-1 Stereo Cartridge. At that time, we were headquartered in a rented one-story barracks in Shinjuku. We started out with three employees, but quickly grew to 20. We worked late each night, stopping only for dinner at the ramen shop in front of the premises.\u201d\nAnyone obsessed with public full-album listening sessions, hi-fi sound and late-night ramen is okay in our book, but it wouldn\u2019t mean much had all that history not led us to Audio Technica\u2019s ATH-M50x headphones, a perfect blend of design, technology and affordability. There are sleeker headphones; headphones that in an A-B test might outperform the M50x; headphones with better noise-cancelation; headphones that more adeptly mimic surround sound. But they are not under $200, and you don\u2019t see them in studios of producers who can afford $1,000 headphones but still go for these utilitarian bangers.\nThis is the part of this recommendation where we\u2019re supposed to get to the specs and explain in detail how Audio-Technica does it.\nType: Closed-back dynamicDriver Diameter: 45 mmFrequency Response: 15 \u2013 28,000 HzMaximum Input Power: 1,600 mW at 1 kHzSensitivity: 99 dB\nAs you\u2019ll see when comparing the ATH-M50x with other brands and models, the specs aren\u2019t show-stopping. You can find headphones with double the driver diameter and high-end frequency response (numbers to pay attention to when comparing headphones) for $50 more, but they won\u2019t be as durable, efficient or time-tested. Audio-Technica\u2019s fancier ATH-AD500X headphones, in fact, have a driver diameter of 53 mm, which sends the waveform toward your eardrums through a slightly wider aperture. (By comparison, most earbuds have a driver diameter of 9-15 mm.)\nIt should be said that M50x headphones aren\u2019t bluetooth-enabled; you need a 3.5 mm audio jack or adapter to use these with most portable devices, and dongles suck. Which is to say, these work best for users who are okay with being tethered to their systems with a cord.\nThe solution: The ATH-M50xBT2, which according to Audio-Technica has \u201cthe same sonic signature of the legendary ATH-M50x studio headphones.\u201d Though bluetooth-enabled headphones do result in more signal loss than cord-reliant models, the difference is barely discernible, at least to these ears. Plus, the M50xBT2 comes with a jack and cord, so if need be these can be used just as you would the M50x.\nNote: a few reviewers have complained about sound cutting out, so be sure to research this issue before you buy. That said, we love our wireless M50xBT2s and have never had connectivity issues with them."

        "content": "This is a post without many words. Mostly the aim is to offer drool-worthy, curious, or otherwise engaging advertisements from the peak hi-fi era of the 1970s, when competition for consumer dollars, coupled with overwhelming demand for home sound systems, generated gear that a half-century later endures.\nTo explore, say, High Fidelity magazine issues from 1973, is to experience desire for objects you never knew you needed. A display ad for, say, Altec\u2019s array of speaker systems from that year, is likely to send you to Reverb or HiFiShark in search of possible deals.\nA simple flip of the digital page reveals aesthetic feats like the JBL 88 Plus.\nThe Empire 598 II from 1973 is a covetable turntable that, five decades later, still generates wonder. Another Empire ad from the era celebrates the company\u2019s 4000D four-channel phono cartridge by depicting it dancing atop a record.\n\u201cWhenever I played my stereo loud my wife made plans to move to her mother\u2019s,\u201d says this cigar-smoking, pinky-ring-wearing, hair-permed guy. \u201cThen a Marantz dealer wised me up.

        "content": "Space. Not the final frontier but the amount of room that all of us have to play with in our homes. Klipsch and Wharfedale customers know all about that issue. Over the past 24 years, I\u2019ve been fortunate to visit the listening rooms of about a dozen fellow reviewers in Canada and the United States \u2013 and almost all of them had one thing in common.\nNot a single one was a completely dedicated listening room isolated from the rest of the house or apartment. Most of the listening rooms were typical dens, living rooms, or home office set-ups. None of the rooms were especially cavernous or horrible acoustic spaces. They were the types of rooms that most people actually share with spouses, children, pets, and stacks of books, records, and furniture. Real life.\nA few are lucky to have a dedicated space that has been treated with acoustic treatments and doesn\u2019t interfere with the day-to-day operation of a house.\u00a0That wouldn\u2019t be me.\u00a0For the most part, I listen in my den, living room, home office, and dining room (one of the best acoustic spaces in our home).\u00a0People enjoy listening to music while they eat. Or sitting at the dining room table late at night working. Most people have to work with what they have. That reality heavily influences what they buy.\nYour room has a huge impact on the sound quality of your system. A smaller room can work really well if you make intelligent choices in regard to equipment and set-up.\nOurMusic Editorhas put off improving her system for the past few years for that very reason. She recently purchased her first home and will be delving into this very topic this month. She is a vinyl-centric listener with a great ear and sizable collection.\nWhen we were discussingher first series of audio reviews, the issue of space and creating a great sounding system for smaller rooms became the topic of conversation. For those paying attention on social media platforms \u2013 it is a topic that comes up quite frequently.\nYour room has a huge impact on the sound quality of your system. A smaller room can work really well if you make intelligent choices in regard to equipment and set-up. My den is 16\u2032 x 13\u2032 x 9\u2032 and I listen with the speakers positioned along the long wall and 8\u2032 from my sofa. If your room is smaller than that \u2014 you are listening in a smaller listening space. A 10\u2032 x 10\u2032 bedroom or dorm room is a smaller listening space.\nHow you listen also matters.\nKlipsch recently released the newKlipsch RP-600M MKII, but having already sampled them \u2014 I\u2019m going to direct you back to the original model which I think is superior. Think Coke Classic versus \u201cNew\u201d Coke. You should be able to find a pair of the original still online or from a dealer and you will be sorry if you think \u201cnewer\u201d model means better.\nWe have seen the original RP-600M for sale on Amazon for under $380 USD and that\u2019s a steal for these loudspeakers. TheKlipsch Audio RP-600M loudspeakersare amazing for a small room though they do benefit from some space behind them and solid stands. They can work on a credenza, but I found them too large for any bookshelf.\nThey are not very difficult to drive, but during their three-month visit in my den (16\u2019 x 13\u2019 x 9\u2019) I discovered that their 96 dB (as quoted by Klipsch in its literature) sensitivity rating was being somewhat optimistic.\nThey are also somewhat restrained sounding by Klipsch standards. The horn-loaded tweeter can be too much if your amplifier or sources are too forward sounding but can also be quite civilized in a smaller listening space.\nBefore you look at their 6.5\u201d Cerametallic\u2122 cone woofers\u00a0and begin to salivate over how much bone crunching bass they obviously create \u2013 lower your expectations. Their bass performance is on the more defined side and actually quite tight. Even in a smaller listening space, they need to be pulled away from the walls. Quality over quantity.\u00a0What makes them so special at their affordable price point is the remarkable degree of presence that they deliver.\nThe choice of side dish will have an enormous impact on the sound quality.\nThe Heed Elixir orSchiit Audio Ragnarok 2integrated amplifiers work especially well with the Klipsch RP-600M. The Heed has a better phono stage but lacks the Ragnarok\u2019s internal DAC and superior headphone amplifier.\nNeither amplifier has a forward sounding treble which is what you want with these loudspeakers.\u00a0They both share a warm tonal balance and excellent pacing. The Heed will create a larger sounding soundstage with the RP-600M.\nVocals will be presented forward of the front baffle of the loudspeaker. Horns should have excellent energy without ripping your ears off. Emotional engagement with your favorite music will be exceptionally high.\nWharfedale likes to keep its loudspeaker line-up fresh and there is plenty to like about thenewDiamond 12.1(reviewed here) two-way loudspeakers.\u00a0A pair of Diamond 10.1s get daily use in my home office so it\u2019s fair to say that I\u2019m a fan after all of these years.\nThe Diamond 12.1 are not particularly large loudspeakers (12.2\u2033 H x 7\u2033 W x 10.9\u2033 D) but they\u2019re a great match for smaller spaces on their matching ST-3 24\u201d stands.\u00a0 They are also not especially hard to drive but they do sound better with between 35-50 watts.\nBetween theNAD C 316BEEandCambridge Audio AXA35integrated amplifiers, it\u2019s hard to go wrong but I\u2019m sticking with the AXA35 in this system because its tonal balance offsets the neutrality of the Diamond 12.1 better.\nI own both amplifiers and swap back and forth a lot so don\u2019t think I\u2019m dismissing the NAD in any way. The NAD has a slight bump in the midrange that works incredibly well with more restrained sounding loudspeakers like theQ Acoustics 3050iand3030i.\nThe 12.1 are not bass monsters but they do everything else so well for the price that it\u2019s easy to forgive that crime of omission.\u00a0Those about to move on because they can\u2019t pulverize your room with bass \u2013 you\u2019re making a rookie mistake.\u00a0Quality not quantity.\nAnd to flesh out the bottom octaves, I suggest adding a subwoofer with these excellent loudspeakers.\u00a0But not just any subwoofer.\u00a0REL\u2019s latest TZero MKIII is their smallest subwoofer but don\u2019t be fooled by its size. REL has always been about quality over quantity and all of their subwoofers do more than just add extended bass response to your system.\nWhen you have it set-up properly, the REL will make the Diamond 12.1 sound larger, more transparent as you raise the volume, and expand the size and width of the soundstage.\nThe AXA35 includes a very competent MM phono stage that works well with high-output Ortofon, Audio-Technica, and Nagaoka cartridges.\nAdd theAndover Songbird/Schiit Audio Modi 3+ streamer/DAC combination and you\u2019re done.\nAudiophile System Builder: Part 1(Magnepan, Q Acoustics, Acoustic Energy, \u2026)\nAudiophile System Builder: Part 2(Zu Audio, Omega Speakers, \u2026)\nView list of allAudiophile System Builderarticles."

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/martinlogan-request-electrostatic-speakers-getting-better-with-age/",
        "content": "I vividly remember the day I flipped over the copy ofStereophileat the newsstand and saw my first pair of MartinLogan loudspeakers. Having inherited the family stereo in 1983 as my Bar Mitzvah gift, I was already on my audiophile journey but I was not prepared for the MartinLogan Sequel II loudspeakers that would inspire me to make high-end audio my career. The Sequel II were my first high-end speakers but only the beginning of my journey which culminated with the MartinLogan reQuest speakers.\nBefore I spent almost $5,000 on a pair of reQuests, I spent almost 8 years with the Aerius, Aerius i, and a pair of the original CLS speakers. I was such a huge fan of the company that I called their office in 1987 in Lawrence, Kansas because I had a question about my pair of Sequel II speakers.\nImagine my surprise when MartinLogan founder, Gayle Sanders, took the call and spent an hour on the phone with me. I was 17 years old and in the process of looking at college applications which included the University of Kansas in Lawrence. Israel and GWU would be my final destination but that one hour on the phone cemented my future in high-end audio and my love of electrostatic loudspeakers. I just didn\u2019t know it at the time.\nFast forward to 2019 and the last real high-end audio show in Rockville, Maryland before the COVID-19 pandemic would disrupt the planet.\nPR Queen Sue Toscano and I have been friends for many years but she was unaware of my history with MartinLogan and how Gayle Sanders had influenced it back in 1987.\nGayle Sanders sold MartinLogan many years ago and had retired from the audio industry to enjoy the fruits of his 25+ years of hard work and success. Those who know him understood that he would return which he did withEikon Audio.\nGayle Sanders and I finally met in 2019 and it was a very memorable day for me meeting the man who set everything in motion for me. He was as gracious as I remember him from our only phone call.\nEikon Audiojust introduced a new two-way system at Capital Audio Fest 2021 that Gayle and I discuss inour recent podcast.\nNow that you know the history, let\u2019s take a look at the MartinLogan reQuest loudspeakers that have been out of production for many years but are one of the best used electrostatic loudspeakers if you can find one.\nThe reQuests were really large back in 1999 when I bought them and I\u2019m sure most people would recoil with some hesitation if they came across a pair today.\nAt 71\u2033H x 18\u2033W x 13\u2033D and 95 pounds apiece, the reQuests are big transducers.\nThe 48\u2033 CLS electrostatic transducer panel has a lifespan of around 12-15 years; and it\u2019s something you need to dust on a regular basis with a vacuum to keep in operational shape. You definitely hear it when the panel starts to show its age. MartinLogan will sell you replacement panels but they\u2019re not $100-$200; so something to think about if you find a pair in good condition with the original panels.\nThe 12-inch high excursion woofer was a big improvement over the smaller drivers in the Sequel II, Aerius, and Aerius i.\nWhat really made the reQuest a better speaker and one of my favorite MartinLogan models was the integration of the woofer and electrostatic panel \u2014 many electrostatic speakers that try to blend both fail miserably.\nThe transparency (the reason why you buy this type of loudspeaker) was jaw dropping with some recordings. There was an ethereal quality to the human voice that would make you sit up and pay attention to every little detail.\nThe other interesting feature of the reQuest was its 90 dB sensitivity rating and impedance (4 ohms).\nHaving owned 4 other pairs of MartinLogan speakers, power is definitely an issue. You can run tube amplifiers with the reQuest but they need to be stable into 4 ohms and at least 50-75 watts/channel.\nI would definitely recommend CJ (solid-state), Pass Labs, Mark Levinson (1980s or 1990s), Bryston, Adcom, Aragon, and older Krell with these loudspeakers.\nThe amp that worked for me was a huge surprise. TheBlue Circle BC6SET Hybrid Amplifier which was only 25 watts/channel. Gilbert Yeung and I were friends for a number of years when I still lived in Toronto and I would make the trip to Innerkip on a regular basis to listen to his new amps and go for food. The BC6 did not operate like any 25 watt amplifier that I\u2019ve ever heard and it matched the reQuest almost perfectly.\nGilbert used the MartinLogan CLS and CLS IIz in his listening room so I wasn\u2019t surprised that the BC6 worked so well.\nIt didn\u2019t possess the low-end control of a Bryston, Aragon, or Krell \u2014 but the midrange resolution and tonal balance was so good that I would listen to the speakers for 3-4 hours at night and awaken in my listening chair at 2 or 3 a.m. almost longing for another session.\nThe transparency (the reason why you buy this type of loudspeaker) was jaw dropping with some recordings. There was an ethereal quality to the human voice that would make you sit up and pay attention to every little detail. The soundstage was also quite wide and deep in my space and the reQuest delivered music with scale and presence like few other speakers.\nIf you don\u2019t have the space for a large pair of electrostatic loudspeakers, these speakers will not work for you. They don\u2019t need to be 5-feet from the wall behind them, but I wouldn\u2019t consider them unless you can move the speaker at least 3-feet out and give them 36-48\u2033 from the sidewalls.\nI ran my pair of reQuests in 3 different apartments and my smallest listening space was 20\u2032 x 16\u2032 x 9\u2032 and always hardwood floors with an area rug.\nThey benefitted from breaking up the hard surfaces behind them by placing two floor-to-ceiling bookshelves filled with books and other forms of absorption. I made sure that the windows in my room had heavy velvet drapes and left them partially open to deal with the reflections off the back wall and ceiling.\nThe MartinLogan reQuest came with rather sharp spikes (mandatory) and I did upgrade the power cords (they require electricity) from the cheap ones provided to $100 models from Blue Circle Audio; they made a significant difference in regard to lowering the noise floor of the speakers and improving the panel\u2019s clarity. I hate audiophile power cords but these particular cords worked.\nI know that this sounds like the behavior of a crazy person but it never looked or felt like overkill for the simple reason that the sound quality I was able to achieve with them was the best I\u2019ve ever had and I wish I could turn back the clock and put that same system together again.\nI\u2019ve seen used reQuest online for between $1,400 \u2014 $1,800 USD and I would say that they are worth it if the panel has been replaced in the past 5 years or less.\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission.\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "title": "Learning from the Hi-Fi past: Audiocraft magazine\u2019s tips for better listening room sound (and other delights)",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/audiocraft-magazine-tips/",
        "content": "The science of sound \u2013 how high-fidelity systems do what they do, and why \u2013 has been a subject of obsessive fascination since the rise of stereophonic systems in the 1950s. As we\u2019ve highlighted before, when first-generation audio engineers including Paul Klipsch (Klipsch) and Henry Kloss (Acoustic Research, Advent) started building their legendary speaker systems, they did so first as hobbyists whose obsession with sound reproduction and serious listening propelled them toward solutions.\nThe early makers who took to basements and woodsheds to experiment with sound were surprisingly generous with their findings. When they figured something out they often shared the information with other Hi-Fi heads through start-up magazines. One of the most fascinating was Audiocraft.\nThough it only lasted three years, the information within offers a window into the quest for better sound and, by extension, better listening rooms.\nThose of us lucky enough to have space for a communal sessions, for example, might be wondering how much power you need in an amplifier to ensure you\u2019ve got enough for everyone to hear. The advice is pretty straightforward, and comes via an editorial in theNov. 1957 issue.\nHow much sound/wattage you need depends on three factors:\n1. Room size. Bigger room = more sound needed. It\u2019s a direct proportion.\n2. Surface absorption. How much stuff in the room absorbs sound affects how much sound you need. A room with a lot of drapes, carpets, and padding needs more sound than a room with hard surfaces.\n3. Type of music. Big music with lots of frequency range makes louder sounds than small groups or solo instruments.\nThe editor, Roy Allison, explains that if you want to awe your listening crew, you want a sound level of about 100 decibels. To get that level in a room that\u2019s about 18 by 12 by 15 feet, with average absorption, you need about a quarter of a watt of acoustic power. That\u2019s for a small room. If you have a more efficient speaker, you need less power. If you have a bigger or more absorptive room, you need more power.\nDoes Audiocraft get into the weeds? Absolutely, and for those not schooled in audio engineering terms, it might take you a day of reading through the issues to fully grasp the jargon. But doing so will yield information you can use for the rest of your life.\nFor example, speaker efficiency is key, but what is it? It\u2019s \u201cthe percentage of acoustic energy radiated in all directions from a speaker, compared to the input of a given amount of power (3% to 4% efficiency is typical for a woofer),\u201d per Galaxy Audio.\nArmed with this information, you can start to understand wattage needs, and understand that speaker efficiency is the most important factor when setting up a listening space. Depending on the speaker and the model, efficiency can vary from less than 1% to nearly 50%. If you have a 40% efficient speaker in an average small room, you only need \u215d watt to get the 100-decibel sound level. But if you have a 1% efficient speaker, you need 25 watts of power. And if your room is three times larger and twice as absorptive, you need 15 watts of power with a 1% efficient speaker.\nAudiocraft also featured profiles of ridiculous homemade systems of the 1950s, the best of which is a mini camper that a sound dude transformed into a rolling hi-fi system.\n\u201cMr. Tatum\u2019s Carnegie Hall,\u201d pictured above, wasa project outlinedin the Jan. 1957 issue. Written by Brooks Tatum, it opens with his issue: he\u2019s both a naturalist and a music freak. \u201cMy problem was to get high-fidelity sound reproduction, from radio and records, into a mobile home 17 feet long, 7 feet in diameter, and of 500 cubic feet total volume.\u201d\nAcross the next three pages, Tatum describes how he did it. For example, his corner wardrobe doubled as a speaker baffle. Included resonant spaces in the floor. He insulated it. In essence, he pretended his mobile home was a speaker cabinet. His conclusion: \u201cThe power and attack of this reproducing system are the source of continuing amazement. Its ability to encompass the entire tonal range \u2026 without effort or default is unexpected and extremely gratifying.\u201d\nThough none of us are likely going to work through these experiments ourselves, it\u2019s reassuring to know that not that long ago a community endeavored to document the ways in which deep listening and high-fidelity send evolved.\nRead the entire three-year run at World Radio History."

        "title": "What\u2019s the Difference Between a Preamplifier, Integrated Amplifier, Power Amp and Receiver?",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/basic-hi-fi-components/",
        "content": "Amplifier. Amp. Preamp. Integrated amp. Phono stage. Tube amplifier. Mono-block. Active speaker. Control amp. Receiver. Solid-state amplifier. Step-up transformer. Powered speaker. Power amp. Phono preamp.\nIf you\u2019re new to high-end audio and looking to build out a system inspired by some of the components you\u2019ve see on Instagram, or something owned by one of your audiophile friends, you are going to need to think about amplification, and you are guaranteed to come across some of the terms from the previous paragraph during your research. But what do they mean?\nThose are a long list of component types but when it comes down to it, you\u2019re basically looking at three things:\nDifferent kinds of amplifiers do one or more of these three things.\nPreamps (also called control amps) are for connecting and selecting sources or inputs like turntables, CD players, tape players/recorders, tuners and other \u201cauxiliary\u201d (AUX) devices, and managing sound characteristics such as volume, treble, bass and balance. They control your inputs and sound, and output a signal to a power amplifier.\nMost of the inputs on a preamp are standard \u201cline-level\u201d inputs. Standardized source output and preamp input levels allow mixing and matching of source components from different manufacturers, safe in the knowledge that they will be compatible with each other.\nBecause source output signals are standardized, you can plug any line-level source into any line-level input (eg. a CD player into the Tuner input, or tape deck into the AUX input) and it will sound the same. This gives flexibility, especially when using modern sources with vintage amps (or vice versa) that weren\u2019t specifically designed for each other.\nHowever, the only non-standard inputs are the one or two phono (or turntable) inputs (see phono preamplifier below). Do not plug line-level sources into phono inputs as you\u2019ll blow the amp or your ears or both.\nMany preamps manufactured between 1995 and 2015 may have omitted phono inputs because vinyl wasn\u2019t very popular at the time; theresurgence of vinylover the past 8 years has changed that situation with most manufacturers offering an internal moving magnet phono preamp inside their preamplifiers, integrated amplifiers, andAVRs.\nA preamp cannot be used independently to drive loudspeakers, and so you won\u2019t see any \u201cwatts per channel\u201d specifications. You also won\u2019t see any speaker output jacks on the back. To get sound to speakers, you\u2019ll need a power amp.\nAlso called a phono stage, and if specifically for Moving Coil (MC) cartridges, a step-up transformer (or SUT) may be in the circuit before the actual phono section. See this article for a write-up ondifferences between Moving Magnet (MM) and MC cartridges.\nA phono preamp takes the very low output from a standardturntable(and very, very, very low output if said turntable is equipped with an MC cartridge) and amplifies it to line level so your preamp can then process it like all the other inputs.\nIt may sound simple to just amplify a low-level signal to line level, but that\u2019s not the case. The signal from the turntable contains two kinds of sound: the sound you want (the music) and sound you don\u2019t want (noise induced by friction and vibration as a tiny diamond rubs against the moving grooves of a spinning vinyl disk on a motorized machine). The phono preamp must be selective, keeping the music and using sophisticated circuitry to filter out the noise. The more sophisticated the amplification and noise filtering, the more expensive the phono preamp.\nThis can all get a bit confusing, but you can think of it this way:\nPower amps (back in the day called simply \u201camplifiers\u201d) are where you connect your loudspeakers, and they\u2019re devoted to transforming output from a preamp to a strong enough electrical signal to move the big, heavy magnets in your speaker drivers.\nPower amps don\u2019t have many inputs or outputs. Typically on a stereo power amp there will be two RCA inputs for the left and right channels coming from your pre-amp, and four speaker output jacks (two each for left and right channels). Some power amplifiers will have balanced XLR inputs as well.\nSome power amps are designed for two sets of speakers, and you\u2019ll see eight speaker-out jacks on the back (four each for A and B sets) and a speaker selector switch on the front.\nConversely, some power amps are designed for just one speaker. These can be used for a mono set-up, or in pairs connected individually to the left and right outputs of a preamp. Mono power amplifiers used this way are commonly called \u201cmonoblocks.\u201d\nThe output of a power amp is measured in watts per channel, with 20 to 50 watts per channel sufficient to satisfactorily drive most vintage and consumer-grade bookshelf or stand-mount speakers, while more power (sometimes in the hundreds of watts) will be necessary for loudspeakers that are more difficult to drive and require the amplifier to double its output into 4 or 2 ohms.\nAnintegrated ampcombines both a preamp and power amp in one box (the pre- and power functions are integrated). There are advantages and disadvantages to integrating the two.\nIntegrated amplifiers take up less space than a two-box pre/power solution. They can also be made more cheaply as everything is housed in one cabinet. The popularity of integrated amps really took off in the late 1960s as solid-state technology (smaller and cheaper with less heat output) began to replace tubes in amplification devices.\nFor high-end audiophiles, the main perceived drawback of integrated amplifiers is reduced sound quality, partly because getting everything packed into one box puts size pressure on all component parts (smaller capacitors and diodes and transformers and heatsink negatively impact signal quality), and partly because electronic circuits are so close together (resulting in electronic interference and degradation of signal purity).\nAnother audiophile benefit of separate amplification is the ability to mix-and-match components, pairing a high-quality preamp from one manufacturer with a top-class power amp from another to achieve the desired sound quality.\nIntegrated amplifiers became popular with the average consumer in the \u201870s and beyond as a cost-effective, space-saving music solution, while serious audiophiles prefer(red) the quality of separate pre- and power amplifiers. That said, many high-end integrated amplifiers produce excellent sound and are still very popular with audiophiles.\nJust as an integrated amplifier combines pre and power amplification functions in a single box, a receiver combines a radio (or tuner) with an integrated amplifier.\nReceivers became popular for similar reasons as integrated amplifiers: space saving and price. Nowadays an added attraction of receivers is the esthetic beauty \u2013 that space-cadet glow \u2013 of the tuning dial (few modern receiver owners actually use them to listen to the radio).\nReceivers became quite large \u2013 if not massive \u2013in the late \u201870s \u201cGolden Era\u201d of audio as manufacturers led by Pioneer,Marantz,Sansuiand Technics strove to out-do each other by producing top-of-the-line receivers with higher and higher power output in a trend known as \u201cThe Receiver Wars,\u201d culminating in 1979 with the Technics SA-1000 which output 330 watts per channel!\nA traditional audio system consists of source components (turntable, tuner, tape deck, CD player, etc.) some sort of amplifier (pre-plus-power combo, integrated amp or receiver) and a set of speakers. The speakers in these systems can\u2019t make sound without the amplifier, and so they are considered \u201cpassive.\u201d\nActive (or powered) speakers take the space-saving \u201ceverything-in-one-box\u201d trend to the extreme, combining amplification (pre and power) and speaker within one (or two) speaker cabinets.\nActive speakers come in a variety of styles. They can be mono or stereo. Single speaker or pair. Wireless or wired. Bluetooth or WiFi. With analog (RCA, XLR), digital (USB, coaxial, optical, HDMI), or analog-and-digital inputs.\nThese days many desktop computer and gaming speakers are active, and may combine with active subwoofers (another kind of active speaker) for enhanced bass.\nOne of the advantages of active loudspeakers is that you have fewer components; which saves both space and money. You also need fewer cables.\nHigh-end manufacturers have introduced a rather significant number of active loudspeakers over the past few years; whilst most are Bluetooth products, there are a growing number of active wireless loudspeakers from traditional high-end brands like Q Acoustics, KEF, Klipsch, PSB, Dynaudio, and Triangle that offer a much higher level of performance.\nSo, there you have it. It all comes down to device selection, sound manipulation, and boosting the music signal so speakers can make a pleasant sound.\nYou are now armed with the lingo required to hit your preferred audio retailer with confidence, or spend an afternoon listening to your dearest audiophile friend without your head spinning in confusion.\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission.\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/empire-troubador-598/",
        "content": "Back in 2021, I wrote aboutwhat attracts me to Vintage Audio.I discussed several factors, like style, craftsmanship and environmental friendliness. I ended by highlighting the intangible value of a piece\u2019s story.\nSometimes the story is about the item itself (who owned it, how it came to the seller, what it was used for in the past) and others it\u2019s more about the manufacturer and model (innovations, where it fits in a brand\u2019s history).\nFor example, my Sansui AU-555 was given to my brother in the early \u201880s by his boss at his part-time furniture re-finishing job. After sitting in his basement for decades, it came to me 5 years ago, and the hand-me-down tale adds to the special feelings I have for it.\nMy KEF Calinda speakers were some of the first ever speakers to feature cabinet and driver placement designed on computers; speaker technology has moved on since 1976, but knowledge of that innovation enhances these speakers\u2019 value in my mind.\nTwo weeks ago I purchased a new (to me) vintage turntable, and this one also involves stories, both of seller and buyer.\nIn early 2019, as I was just getting back into vinyl, my Instagram friend Kevin (@mistachen) shot me a message about a turntable for sale that he thought would be a good step up for me. An Empire Troubador 598 (forget which model). C$450. Beautiful. The photos don\u2019t even do this remarkable turntable justice.\nHaving just gotten my first turntable a few months before, and not knowing too much about what was what, I hardly even knew what I was looking at. Old for sure, and sexy, and shiny-champagne-gold. Intimidating. Too much turntable for my system of the time. I dithered. It sold. I didn\u2019t think too much of it.\nI\u2019d like to think my turntable knowledge has improved since then. Just a bit. Over the intervening 30 months, every now and then an Empire would pop up on my Instagram feed or in a Facebook audio group and I\u2019d drool. Still sexy. Not so intimidating anymore. Less overkill for my evolving system. I\u2019d flash back to the one I passed on and think, \u201cWhat if?\u201d\nI follow quite a few vintage audio sellers and restorers on Instagram. I get amazingly satisfying, vicarious pleasure from watching restoration projects progress and unfold, and then seeing the end-result pieces available for sale or integrated into working systems.\nSometimes pieces show up fully fledged, with no restoration story. That\u2019s fine; I can still admire, drool and covet. About a month ago, a post popped up on Instagram from@woostervintageaudioin Ohio featuring an exquisite Empire 598 Troubadour III for sale.\nBeautiful, but not a realistic purchase for me as I prefer to buy local, particularly when it comes to turntables (I see too many unboxing posts of destroyed equipment, poorly packaged by the seller or poorly handled by the courier, and don\u2019t want to take chances either way).\nFiguring someone would be interested, I shared the Empire post in my IG story. Not sure if it drew any traffic for Wooster, but a few hours later I got a personal message from Dan (@iloveyoucoffeeshop), a local Instagram connection, saying his uncle was looking to sell an Empire and asking if I\u2019d be interested.\nA few days and messages back and forth later, I got an email with photos from his uncle, Sam, and a couple of days after that I popped over for an up-close look.\nA few years ago, Sam took care of a house and dog for a friend for several weeks and was given the Empire (and some other equipment) in lieu of cash payment. That became part of his sizzling audio set-up for the next few years.\nThen recently his son downsized from house to apartment, couldn\u2019t accommodate a full-sized audio system, and passed it on to him. Now Sam\u2019s living area was overrun with audio equipment, and the Empire was assigned to the surplus-to-requirements list.\nEverything seemed fine with the player, barring what sounded like a minor suspension issue and a couple of blemishes to the champagne gold finish on the platter (a common issue I understand, and not surprising with a 50 year-old piece). The price was more than reasonable, and into the back of my car it went.\nSo what\u2019s so special about the Empire 598 then, besides its retro-magic looks?\nThe early \u201870s brochure states:\u201cThe turntable was designed to far exceed professional standards of performance\u2026 Long life and trouble-free operation are guaranteed\u2026 by an ingenious turntable design that involves only two moving parts, a powerful hysteresis synchronous motor and a heavy aluminium turntable platter individually balanced to the peak of perfection. Finally, the handsome and functional looks will enhance any room. This is the world\u2019s most perfect record playback system. With cast aluminium platter, fitted with the Empire 990 Tonearm.\u201d\nI can\u2019t really argue with that. The 598 Troubador was introduced in 1970 and stayed in production until 1976. Some will argue that its predecessor, the 498, was better, but there aren\u2019t many of those around and the 598 is the one you see most often. The 698 that followed coincided with a change of ownership (and decline in Empire\u2019s fortunes) and was rife with performance issues.\nThere were multiple iterations of the belt-driven 598 (you\u2019ll see Mark I, II and III). It\u2019s not 100% clear what the differences are and in some cases it seems parts and specifications are somewhat interchangeable.\nThere\u2019s a good thread onAudioKarmaabout the history of Empire and their turntables.\nThe one now in my basement is the two-speed (33.33 and 45 rpm) Mark II, with a 12\u2033 cast aluminium, two-piece platter (the drive portion is 7 lbs and 3 inches thick; once in motion, it acts as a massive flywheel which helps maintain accurate speed).\nIt features a dynamically balanced hysteresis synchronous motor, micro-honed oilite main bearings, pneumatic suspension, and Empire\u2019s own 990 tonearm.\nAll of this goodness is mounted on a heavy wood plinth with impressive wood-and-glass flip-up cover. Ideally there\u2019d be an Empire cartridge installed, but the Pickering VX-15 it came with sounds very nice.\nThe suspension issue noted at purchase (the platter rubbed on the top plate on one side) was easily repaired by adjusting the three wingnuts that attach the platter mechanism to the plinth on the underside. That taken care of, the table operates almost flawlessly. Speed is incredibly accurate, wow and flutter almost non-existent, and sound is superb, with no perceptible rumble, hum or other background noise.\nIf I have one gripe, it is with the auto-lift function at the end of a record, which is finicky. The mechanism is magnetic and engages via a metal piece protruding from the pivot end of the tonearm.\nAs the record ends and the stylus enters the lead out grooves, the protrusion gets closer to the magnetic arm lifter, which lifts and pulls the arm up and over at the same time.\nWith most records the arm lift works fine, but those with a narrow lead-out groove are a problem as the lift mechanism engages before the music is over, with a loud, jarring sound that gives an unsatisfying ending to the final track.\nMy initial solution to this issue was to use one of my other turntables for records with less than a centimeter of lead-out, but I then learned that the auto-lift can be disengaged by tilting the lift column, making the table fully manual.\nNot perfect, but a reasonable workaround. At least I\u2019m not forced to choose which turntable I\u2019ll use based on how nightmarish my end-of-record experience will be.\nMinor gripes aside, this Empire Troubadour is absolutely a keeper. It\u2019s not surprising that Empire turntables, back in the early \u201870s, were considered \u201ctop tier\u201d along with Rek-O-Kut, Thorens and Acoustic Research, and used as transcription players by radio stations across North America. I\u2019m honoured to own one of these beauties, and love having another piece of music history in my listening room.\nAnd that\u2019s the story of the Empire. If you\u2019d like to see more, hop onto my Instagram at@audioloveyycfor a lot of pictures of the 598 and what I\u2019m spinning on it. I\u2019ll leave you there, and hopefully this lead-out is smoother than some of my early Empire 598 record spins.\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission.\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "title": "Vintage Bookshelf Speakers: DeVore Fidelity Gibbon 3",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/devore-fidelity-gibbon-3/",
        "content": "DeVore Fidelity has been handcrafting world class loudspeakers out of its workshop in Brooklyn\u2019s Navy Yards for almost 20 years and over that time, I have been fortunate to experience many of its designs at home, dealer showrooms, trade shows, and people\u2019s homes.\nWandering into theCommon Wave Audio Hi-Fi room at T.H.E. Show in June 2022, was my first time in many years to have the opportunity to listen to one of John\u2019s latest creations and after spending more than 45 minutes listening to the O/baby \u2013 I was left with some serious regret in regard to an older pair ofDeVore Gibbon 3sthat I was forced to sell back in 2009.\nThere is a wonderful scene in Carl Reiner\u2019s 1967 comedyEnter Laughingwhere Reni Santoni\u2019s character enters the set with an insane laugh and then looks into the audience and suffers the worst case of stage fright in the history of theater. After some prodding from Elaine May, he recovers and gets better with each scene, but it\u2019s a good thing that he always had pharmacy school to fall back on.\nJohn Devore doesn\u2019t have to worry about going to pharmacy school, because the smallest member of the DeVore line-up was positively killer. It required more power than the Gibbon Super 8s or original Silverback Reference loudspeakers, but with the right amplifier; and not necessarily a very expensive one, it was one of the best 2-way monitors I have ever listened to and easy to work with if you can\u2019t get away with stands in the middle of your room.\nAt 12.5\u201dH x 6.5\u201d W x 9.5\u201d D, the Gibbon 3s were not exactly huge; they just sounded that way. They were manufactured and assembled in DeVore\u2019s Brooklyn-based factory and available in several beautiful hardwood veneers. My personal pair were finished in a light cherry and had a wonderful grain throughout.\nThe fit and finish were superb and while they were not inexpensive at $1,700 USD per pair back in 2006, there was nothing off-the-shelf (minus the Cardas binding posts) about the drivers which were custom-designed by Scanspeak for this specific loudspeaker to John\u2019s very exact specifications.\nThey were also a rear-ported design that did not suffer from bass bloat if they were placed too close to the wall behind them \u2014 a feature that I always felt was unique.\nSetting up the Gibbon 3s was a lot of fun, because its size allowed me to try it in more than one room; and even inside a wall unit which is where it might end up for some listeners.\nSpeakers have come and gone over the years, but speaker stands filled with sand never seem to get the hint. Being 6\u2019 3\u201d tall, I require taller stands for stand-mounted speakers, so I tried the Gibbon 3s on 24\u201d and 28\u201d stands (both were of the 4-post sand-filled variety with those nasty spikes that pierce flesh), ultimately preferring the 24\u201d height due to the tighter bass response and image height.\nMy living room (at the time) was 20\u2019 x 13\u2019 x 8\u2019, with my listening chair 4\u2019 from the wall behind it. A 108\u201d wide built-in maple/cherry wall unit took up most of the right side of the room. Additional seating, a fireplace (opening was covered up during reviews), and my equipment rack occupied the left side of the room. Our hardwood floor was partially covered by an 8\u2032 x 10\u2032 wool rug.\nThe room was on the \u201clively\u201d side, but the wall unit, seating, and carpet did a decent job of taming it. All the windows were covered with absorbent horizontal blinds.\nThe first position I tried was on the 24\u201d stands with the rear of the speakers 36\u201d from the wall behind them. The outside edges of the speakers were 20\u201d from the sidewalls. I started with the speakers pointed straight ahead, which is generally how I\u2019ve always positioned speakers in my room. The results were encouraging (after about 30 hours of abuse \u2013 AC/DC), but I felt that the sound could be more \u201copen\u201d with them pulled out even further.\nAt 45\u201d, I hit the target. The distance from the sidewalls was not enough and I ended up pushing them closer together so that they were 32\u201d from the edge to the walls. Everything seemed to gel, and I left them there (making them an easy target for my baby daughter) for the duration of the review.\nDeVore Fidelity\u2019s literature claimed that the Gibbon 3\u2019s frequency response was 45Hz \u2013 30kHz (+/-dB?) and while we have no technical measurements to refute or validate that claim, my time spent living with the speakers and specific amplifiers, proved that the Gibbon 3s were certainly capable of reproducing very deep and taut bass response; certainly, a lot more than its size suggested.\nAt 86dB (8 ohms), the Gibbon 3s were not a SET-friendly load, unless one were thinking of using something with 845 output tubes. My Fi X amplifier loaded with Sophia 2A3s barely made a dent. No shirt, no shoes, no dice. The Fi only offered a mere glimpse of the Gibbon 3\u2019s un-boxy sounding midrange and extended top end.\nThe late-Don Garber even warned me before I tried his wonderful amplifier that it was not a combination that would work.\nNext up were the Leben CS-300x integrated amplifier and Shindo Labs Montille power amplifier; both push-pull EL84 designs offering 12 juicy watts. The Montille has gain pots which can be raised/lowered depending on your choice of preamplifier (Shindo Labs Aurieges L and Fi Y) and I generally left them at the midnight hour. I occasionally tried them at 1 or 2, but 90 per cent of my listening was done at 12 O\u2019clock.\nBrownie McGhee and Sonny Terry\u2019s rendition of \u201cEveryday I have the Blues\u201d may have been foreshadowing of some mischief yet to come, but boy did it sound sweet and expansive while it lasted. The Leben CS-300x was a really underrated product.\nThe Gibbon 3s are a very open and immediate sounding loudspeaker that excel in the midrange and treble; wonderfully open, tonally rich, and blessed with top end extension that is airy and never etched or shrill. While quite resolute in the bass, the Leben just didn\u2019t have the power or grip to really drive these speakers to levels that hard rocking folks might demand.\nFolks who enjoy jazz, blues, chamber, folk, choral at sane listening levels will probably deem me a sadist for complaining, but Green Day, Zeppelin, Floyd, and Flea were merely \u201cgood\u201d when I pushed the CS-300x/Gibbon 3s.\nMozart and Dolphy were outstanding; the midrange resolution and presence made these speakers really excel with vocals and string instruments.\nEric Dolphy was a genius, and that genius made \u201cG.W.\u201d look almost smart through the Gibbon 3s. His Alto Sax and Bass Clarinet had bite without chewing one\u2019s head off.\nThe Gibbon 3s and CS-300x are a winning combination if you don\u2019t live on a diet of Pavement, Green Day, and Metallica at levels that even Lars would threaten to kick your ass for listening to music at. Strive for that emotional connection without going deaf.\nThe Shindo Labs Aurieges/Montille have wonderful resolution from top-to-bottom, and a slightly warm tonal balance, which also really complimented the immediate and open presentation of the Gibbon 3s. Unlike the Leben CS-300x, which ran out of gas at loud levels, the Montille seemed to take it more in stride and rolled off more gracefully.\nHank Mobley\u2019s \u201cBouncing with Bud\u201d and Lightnin\u2019 Hopkins\u2019 \u201cTake it Easy\u201d both offer their own unique challenges and the Gibbon 3s barely broke a sweat. I enjoyed both tracks at low and high listening levels thanks to the extraordinary detail retrieval and clarity. The speakers do not gloss over bad recordings, which will most likely annoy fans of over-produced formulaic schlock pop.\nGreat sounding pop such asDeparturefrom The Mammals, Winterpills\u2019 self-titled release, and Ruth Gerson\u2019sWake to Echokept me engaged for hours.\nMy NAD T753 and T763 surround receivers also worked rather well with the Gibbon 3s, supporting them with a lot more power, but the combination that I really enjoyed was the Gibbon 3s with the Arcam Solo (which I borrowed for a week).\nThe Solo (\u201cWhy you stuck up, scruffy lookin\u2026\u201d) was a 75 watt integrated amplifier/CD player/AM/FM tuner unit from Arcam that really blew the doors off with a speaker such as the Gibbon 3s.\nIt didn\u2019t quite have the detail retrieval or coherence of the Leben/Shindo Labs equipment, but the price differences were so enormous at the time (almost 50% less than the Leben and 75% less than the Shindo rig), that it was hard to ignore just how well the combination performed.\nRy Cooder\u2019sCh\u00e1vez Ravinewas my sleeper album of 2005, and its unique, dirty, gritty flavor oozed out of the Gibbon 3s like the bean and cheese from a good burrito. It burns your skin and stains like a mother on that new shirt you\u2019re wearing, but man is it good. The Solo had surprisingly fatcajonesfor a Brit piece of kit. The Gibbon 3s were from Brooklyn.\nKT Tunstall\u2019s \u201cBlack Horse and the Cherry Tree\u201d fromEyes to the Telescopehad a snappy beat to it and the Gibbon 3/Solo combination went along for the ride. Good album, gritty singer, great song to get drunk and start dancing to.\nMy only real complaint about the Gibbon 3s involve their sensitivity; they are not the easiest speakers to drive and that\u2019s a shame because I have no doubt that they would sound great with something like the Fi Super X, Almarro A205A MK II, etc\u2026which were more affordable than the Leben CS-300x and the Shindo Labs gear.\nIf you can find a pair today in excellent shape, they will work well with solid-state amplification that is slightly warmer sounding. Cambridge Audio, Rega, Arcam, McIntosh, Rotel, and older NAD amplifiers would be a great match as long as the power output is there.\nTheUnison Research Triode 25 Integrated Amplifierthat I reviewed last year would be superb with these loudspeakers but that is a rather hefty investment\nTheir superb coherence, punchy and immediate midrange, detailed and airy treble, superb imaging, and surprisingly deep bass response all add up to a complete package that is domestically friendly and a very mature sounding loudspeaker that I never should have sold.\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission.\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "title": "Want to channel better sound into your hi-fi system or headphones? Buying a DAC will change your listening life",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/dac-cambridge/",
        "content": "Getting lost in music is an act of vanishing, and if the ultimate goal of high-fidelity sound, vinyl culture and deep listening is to establish the clearest possible connection between the soundwaves that musicians made in the studio and your wide-open eardrums, it should hardly matter whether those waves arrive through analog, digital, carrier pigeon or some mystical signal generated by God herself.\nAs long as they make their way to the pleasure receptors, these missives in their purest form are format-neutral.\nOne convincing argument goes that embracing vinyl and hi-fi culture shouldn\u2019t require a whole-hog dismissal of digital music, especially considering that high-definition streaming and download services offer sound quality that greatly surpasses the dull, compressed thud of MP3s in the days of yore and the tinny sibilance of pre-2000 compact discs. Vinyl will always reign supreme for reasons too many to enumerate, but the truth is, if the sole intent is to allow your favorite artists\u2019 recordings to overtake you, when deep inside your favorite Lee \u201cScratch\u201d Perry, Autechre or Karen Dalton song you won\u2019t be thinking about the \u201chows\u201d of its source but so absorbed in the wonder of it all as to forgot such non-cosmic concerns.\nBefore we go any further and in the spirit of full disclosure, this post is about two products created by the British company Cambridge Audio, and was commissioned, in part, by them. ISC agreed to this effort, though, because long before the company reached out, the Cambridge Audio DACMagic 100 had already changed the way I think about 21st century listening and sound, and its machine expanded my world when the pandemic hit. Regardless, armed with the DAC, I found myself spending hours in my music room time-traveling to sonic realms in ways I\u2019d not before imagined.\nOne reason why LPs, cassettes and CDs are being snatched up by generations reared on music streaming, MP3s and instant YouTube gratification might be because this time three years ago we were collectively faced with\u00a0many, many hours of free time while starved of what to many of us was our lifeblood: live music. An experience that we all took for granted \u2013\u2013 spending uninterrupted, intentional time getting lost inside music at concerts or on dance floors \u2013\u2013 disappeared.\nSeeking alternative ways to scratch that itch, we rediscovered an endeavor that had faded with the rise of Walkmans, boomboxes, iPods and other portable music disrupters: sitting around and spending serious, uninterrupted time with physical music and committing to the intention that comes with dropping a needle or flipping the side. Not in the background. In the foreground. So it overtakes you and, ultimately, carries you away to some ethereal everywhere.\nOne vinyl clerk recently noted a trend that\u2019s apparent across the country: \u201cI was working at a record shop during the pandemic, and once we reopened, there was a whole new group of people who were like, \u2018I just got turned on to records. I\u2019m getting a soundsystem.\u2019\u201d\nPowering up the DAC and hearing high-def streaming for the first time was, to a certain extent, akin to cleaning smudged eyeglasses to reveal a forgotten, longed-for vibrancy.\nIn his epic bookOcean of Sound: Aether Talk, Ambient Sound and Imaginary Worlds,writer and musician David Toop contemplated the secret realm that reverberating soundwaves can create, one which many of us now visit on a regular basis and as often as possible. He noted that \u201cwhether the echoes are synthetic or natural \u2013\u2013 Jamaican dub, a North African call to dawn prayer shattering the early morning silence as it blasts out of a tower-mounted loudspeaker, Elvis Presley\u2019s \u2018Heartbreak Hotel\u2019 or a Javanese gamelan recorded under the high roof of a royal palace \u2013\u2013 there is no escaping their power to suggest actual, virtual and fantasy spaces.\u201d\nThe post-punk band Mekons called it \u201cthat secret place that we all want to go: rock and roll.\u201d David Berman of Purple Mountains described said \u201cvirtual and fantasy spaces\u201d this way:\nSongs build little rooms in timeAnd housed within the song\u2019s designIs the ghost the host has left behindTo greet and sweep the guest insideStoke the fire and sing his lines.\nAs long as you\u2019ve got keys to the \u201crooms in time,\u201d it makes little sense to reject non-analog sound signals that seek only to gratify you.\u00a0And so-called \u201cdeep listening sessions\u201d certainly don\u2019t require primo turntables and cartridges, tube amps or $10k speakers to have an effect, though we\u2019ll always argue that they can be remarkable enhancements.\nThough I already had a decent vintage set-up before the pandemic, in the thick of it I decided to use some government money to buy said digital to analog converter (DAC).\u00a0After doing a ton of research and reading countless reviews, I settled on a $200 DACMagic 100. At that point it was the only DAC I\u2019d ever used, though I\u2019ve since sampled a number of others at various listening sessions.\nPowering up the DAC and hearing high-def streaming for the first time was, to a certain extent, akin to cleaning smudged eyeglasses to reveal a forgotten, longed-for vibrancy. Where formerly I\u2019d outputted my Powerbook through a cheap digital-to-analog converter and plugged that via RCA jacks into an auxiliary input on my amplifier, the DACMagic spirited the digital signal of the Sun City Girls\u2019 formerly tinnyTorch of the Mysticsstream past the laptop\u2019s sound card, amplified, clarified, enhanced, beefed-up \u2013\u2013 pick your steroid-suggestive verb \u2013\u2013 the sound coming from Qobuz, Apple Music and Spotify to reveal recording depths otherwise only suggested. It was one of the best audio investments (about $200) I\u2019ve made in years.\nWhen, a few months ago, I raved about my DACMagic experience to Cambridge Audio\u2019s Matt Reilly, he graciously offered to ship me the company\u2019s luxurious DACMagic 200. Its main upgrade, among others, is a headphone jack that has enhanced my (Audio Technica) headphone experience just as the DACMagic 100 did with my vintage system (for reference, a Harman Kardon 730 twin powered amplifier and Large Advent speakers).\nDuring our call, Reilly discussed the company\u2019s range of offerings, all of which he described as meeting a current cultural desire to \u201cget us back in touch with the magic within music.\u201d He echoed that idea during aconversation with our friends at Aquarium Drunkard, describing \u201cthe escapism that can happen when you\u2019re taken away to another time or memory by a melody.\u00a0This can only happen when you fully embrace a song with no outside distractions. I imagine we will soon see lots of studies which show a ritualistic take of \u2018quality sound\u2019 as therapeutic exercise and a key well-being trend.\u201d\nIt stands to reason, because the thrill of being carried away is that ultimately you end up in a kind of Utopia. Here\u2019s Ryuichi Sakamoto talking to Toop about his version of this place:\n\u201cOne of my friends, he\u2019s a philosopher and critic. He made a word: outernationalism. Internationalism is still based on nationality. Being outernational is like Moses in the desert. There\u2019s no country. There is just trade, transportation, communication and merchants, but there\u2019s no nationality. It\u2019s a utopia and I like it.\u201d Though he forgot to mention art and/or music, he added, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be Japanese. I want to be a citizen of the world. It sounds very hippie but I like that.\u201d During that time (the late \u201980s or early \u201990s), Sakamoto would include a then-new-fangled technology among his performance gear and send border-penetrating missives in real time.\nWitnessing one of these concerts in the \u201990s, Toop realized that \u201ctechnology can reduce live performance to an anachronism. In the past decade, computers have delivered cybernetic music into realms which reach beyond human capabilities. For example, a concert stage in London: Ryuichi Sakamoto is faxing messages to friends around the globe during \u2018Rap the World,\u2019 a song in which machines do more of the work than the humans.\u201d\n(To riff on Toop\u2019s thought, it\u2019s not just technology that can upend live performance. A pandemic, we now understand, can also reduce live performance to an anachronism, or at least reconfigure it.)\nTo conclude on what may or may not be a non sequitur about the act of receiving clear messages from That Secret Place, Pauline Oliveros recalled the genesis of her phrase \u201cdeep listening\u201d in Toop\u2019s book, one that resonates on any number of levels when discussing the transformative nature of both recorded and live performance. She recalled in 1988 recording in a \u201cbig cistern\u201d in order to release a compact disc of the music.\n\u201cWhen I was trying to write the liner notes, I was trying to come to some conclusion about what it was we were actually doing in there. The two words came together \u2013 deep listening \u2013 because it\u2019s a very challenging space to create music in, when you have forty-five seconds reverberation coming back at you. The sound is so well mirrored, so to speak, that it\u2019s hard to tell direct sound from the reflective sound.\u201d\nShe continued of experiencing sound in a cistern, \u201cIt puts you in the deep listening space. You\u2019re hearing the past, of sound that you made; you\u2019re continuing it, possibly, so you\u2019re right in the present, and you\u2019re anticipating the future, which is coming at you from the past.\u201d\nMay we all luxuriate such a heavenly place.\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "title": "Audiophile Jazz Vinyl Pressings: Exit to Vintage Street",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/audiophile-jazz-vinyl/",
        "content": "A big bone of contention in audiophile circles is which stage of the audio system chain is most important. By extension, where an individual places priority \u2013 source, amplification, or loudspeakers dictates the percentage of the available budget devoted to each.\nA large group will argue that loudspeakers are most important as they produce the sound reaching our ears; if the speakers are not very good, the music won\u2019t be delivered properly and won\u2019t sound right. Now, what\u2019s \u201cright\u201d is subjective \u2013 some prefer more visceral bass, a warmer sounding midrange, greater detail, and no two loudspeakers are created equal sound signature wise \u2013 but there certainly is something to the argument that speakers are the most important.\nPerhaps a smaller group will argue that amplification is more important. Here you\u2019ll find discussion around the ability of an amplifier (power/preamp separates or all-in-one integrated amplifier) to convert the signal from the source without distortion, around tube versus solid-state, and around power output and the ability to drive different speaker technologies, sensitivities, and impedances.\nThen there\u2019s the set who highlight the importance of cables and interconnects, but I\u2019m not touching that one.\nAnd finally, another large grouping will insist that source is paramount. If they stream, it\u2019ll be all about the quality of the DAC (Digital to Analog Converter). If their source of choice is CD or SACD, it\u2019ll be the combination of transport and DAC (separates or combined in a single unit). And for vinyl, it\u2019ll be turntable and cartridge, and perhaps even stylus.\nThe thinking here is \u201cgarbage in, garbage out\u201d (GIGO), or the opposite \u201cmagic in, magic out;\u201d if you can ensure the quality of what you feed the system, you increase the chance that what comes out will sound incredible. Again, some solid logic here.\nPersonally, I take a whole-system approach. I side with both the speaker and source sets, but believe all stages are important, and improvements in one stage will eventually require improvements or changes in others.\nNew speakers may dictate a more powerful integrated or power amp, or addition of tubes for synergy. Shifting from a moving magnet (MM) phono cartridge to moving coil (MC) may necessitate a better phono stage, or even a Step-up Transformer (SUT) for low-output MC cartridges.\nOn the vinyl source side though, there\u2019s a step beyond cartridge and stylus that deserves more attention, and that is the vinyl itself. There is a growing awareness of vinyl and mastering quality, and a growing penetration of \u201caudiophile vinyl\u201d in the market. Mastering engineers like Kevin Gray, Ryan Smith, Bernie Grundman, Ron McMaster, Doug Sax and Steve Hoffman, and studios like Cohearent Audio and Sterling Sound have become household names in audiophile circles for the quality of their remasters.\nIn the last few years, one of the most successful labels in this category has been Blue Note with theirTone Poet series, which was introduced in 2019 to celebrate the company\u2019s 80thanniversary, and features all-analog, 180 gram audiophile vinyl reissues mastered from the original master tapes.\nThe Tone Poet Series has been huge for Blue Note. For long-time jazz freaks, new releases have been an opportunity to fill in holes in the collection with titles never released on vinyl or long out-of-print (and expensive on secondary markets), or to replace well loved, worn out original or early pressings with fresh, super-charged updates.\nFor many younger vinyl fans, Tone Poet albums \u2013 not much more expensive than \u201cregular\u201d records \u2013 have been a combined point of entry to jazz, Blue Note, and audiophile recordings. These fans buy Tone Poet releases partly because they\u2019re budget friendly, but mostly because they sound incredible. Store owners talk of spinning new titles, customers rushing the counter to ask what\u2019s playing, and purchases immediately being made.\nNew releases sell out quickly, but the word on the street is that all titles will eventually be repressed; this makes me happy as I was a bit late to the party and missed some of the early releases. Facebook groups devoted to Tone Poets have sprung up with avid discussion on favorites and speculation on future releases.\nMitch Anderson and I recently did apodcast\u00a0with Mastering Engineer Kevin Gray, and Producer Joe Harley. If you haven\u2019t given this one a listen, you owe it to yourself to do so. Kevin and Joe gave insights on a variety of topics, including how the Tone Poet sound came to be and how mastering and selection are done.\nWhat caught my attention was when they spoke of their initial plan for Tone Poet to reproduce as closely as possible the sound of the original album pressings, and their surprise at how much additional information (bass, detail, soundstage) came through from the first few master tapes they received.\nApparently, Rudy Van Gelder applied significant compression in transferring tapes to pressings to create records that didn\u2019t skip on the turntables of the \u201850s and \u201860s (and thus avoid customers returning unplayable albums).\nTurntable and cartridge tracking advances since that time mean skipping is less of an issue, so the decision was made to reproduce the sound of the master tapes as opposed to the original pressings, and that is why this series has such amazing body and impact, and why listeners have responded so positively to each release.\nThere are numerous other audiophile vinyl companies out there as well, many of which have been around a lot longer than Tone Poet.\nMobile Fidelity Sound Labs(aka MFSL or MoFi) got its start in the late \u201850s with novelty recordings. In 1977, they began producing the Original Master Recordings reissues, recorded with their half-speed mastering process from original master tapes and pressed on heavyweight, virgin \u201csupervinyl.\u201d They have been owned by Music Direct since 2001.\nMobile Fidelity records come in two styles. Early releases were cut at the traditional 33.3 rpm, but recent releases have been offered on multiple records at 45 rpm. With the higher speed of 45 rpm, record grooves are \u201clonger\u201d and can hold more detailed information, theoretically delivering better sound quality (which more often than not they do).\nThe downside of this higher speed is that a single record side can\u2019t hold as much music, hence a typical album becoming a two-record release, and the listener having to flip the record every 8-12 minutes instead of the more typical 20-plus.\nMoFi don\u2019t just focus on jazz. Some of their classic rock releases by artists like Steely Dan, Pink Floyd, Supertramp, Bob Dylan and Donald Fagen are highly sought after and command huge prices on the secondary market due to a lack of recent represses. Other artists and titles have seen multiple represses over the years \u2013 like the bulk of the Dire Straits catalog which sounds a lot better on these remastered pressings but still puts a hit on the wallet.\nThere have been numerous jazz albums released by Mobile Fidelity, the best known being reissues of Miles Davis\u2019 Columbia Records catalog, and in particular,Kind of Bluefor which the MoFi pressing has been the reference for many years.\nIn 2016, MoFi created a new, ultra-premium series calledUltradisc One-Step. These are released in very limited numbers, pressed at 45 rpm on 180 gram premium vinyl, and housed in elaborate box sets. Bill Evans\u2019Sunday at the Village VanguardandPortrait in Jazz, andMonk\u2019s Dreamby Thelonious Monk have all had the One-Step treatment, but good luck finding copies and be prepared to sell a body part to get one. Audiophiles will spend north of $200 on any of these titles, and more on the secondary market.\nAnalogue Productions(AP) is the in-house audiophile label of Acoustic Sounds. It was founded in 1992 by music fan and entrepreneur Chad Kassem in Salina, Kansas. Early releases were pressed in California and Germany, but in 2011 Kassem launched his own state-of-the-art pressing plant, Quality Record Pressings (QRP).\nLike MoFi, Analogue Productions masters from original analogue master tapes. Exceptions are made for albums of rare quality recorded digitally in the CD era. All are pressed on 180 gram or 200 gram vinyl. Many AP reissues have been released in both 33.3 and 45 rpm formats, though some are one or the other.\nEither way, they sound incredible, and a generation of music lovers has benefitted enormously from Kassem\u2019s business acumen and selections; case in point, his decision to promote numerous forgotten blues musicians who never before reached a large, global audience. The quality of the recordings and attention to detail in the pressings makes them a very worthwhile addition to any music library.\nAnalogue Productions have put out over 300 reissues, with a large proportion of their catalogue being jazz from the big labels like Blue Note, Prestige, Fantasy, Impulse, Verve, Columbia and Riverside. Recent releases have come primarily from Verve and Impulse, perhaps due to other labels like Blue Note and Concord seeing market growth and taking their audiophile reissues in-house.\nLike MoFi, Analogue Productions has introduced an ultra-premium reissue series of its own called UHQR (or Ultra High Quality Recording). I haven\u2019t heard it yet, but reportedly theUHQR ofKind of Blue(I have two on order) takes the mantle as the new reference recording away from the MoFi. This will be a series to watch with great interest.\nOwned by Concord,Craft Recordingswas founded in 2017 as a reissue vehicle for the Concord catalog, which includes legacy labels like Fantasy, Milestone, Prestige, Riverside, Vee Jay and others. Their catalog is extensive and growing; including numerous reissues of classic albums from Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Sonny Rollins, Thelonious Monk, Bill Evans and Chet Baker. A recent limited-edition, ultra-premium reissue ofColtrane\u2019sLush Lifesold outon their online store within minutes of release.\nImpexis a newer audiophile label from the team that previously ran Cisco Music, itself a respected reissue label, which closed shop in 2008. The Impex catalog is relatively small, but they have reissued some amazing jazz albums, including the classic liveFriday Night in San Franciscoby Al Di Meola, Paco de Lucia and John McLaughlin (33.3 and 45 rpm versions), and several reissues from the famous Three Blind Mice J-Jazz label; theThree Blind Mice 45 Boxwill blow your socks off.\nBarely Breaking Even(BBE) is another reissue label that has done a lot of Japanese Jazz reissues, both of full albums, and their excellent compilation series,J Jazz: Deep Modern Jazz from Japanwhich is now up to Volume 3.\nOther audiophile reissue labels to look out for includeOriginal Recordings Group(ORG),Pure Pleasure,Speakers Corner,Music Matters(Joe Harley\u2019s Blue Note reissue project before he moved to Tone Poet), and Classic Records (now taken over by Acoustic Sounds, but worth buying on the used market). There are certainly other labels I haven\u2019t covered here, and I\u2019d love to hear about them in the comments or via Instagram at@audioloveyyc.\nIf you haven\u2019t yet ventured into audiophile vinyl and want to get more from your system without upgrades, then check out some of these labels and recordings; you\u2019ll be impressed. And if you\u2019re already sold, look out for some of the less prominent labels and give them a try; there are some real gems out there.\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission.\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/best-budget-hi-fi-speakers-2023/",
        "content": "We don\u2019t need to tell our readership that inflation has had a huge impact on hi-fi sales over the past 15 months. Coming out of the pandemic where consumers spent a lot of money on TVs, wireless headphones, soundbars, and turntables, manufacturers are currently struggling to get people to buy. For those looking for a new pair of loudspeakers in 2023, there are some rather good options if funds are tight. The best budget hi-fi speakers of 2023 features some rather well known brands and a few outliers that might not be on your radar.\nBookshelf or stand-mounted loudspeakersare evolving and while the movement is in the direction of wireless loudspeakers, there is still no shortage of excellent and affordable passive bookshelf options right now. My favorite budget bookshelf loudspeakers of 2023 feature a wide range of options.\nNot everyone has the space or budget forfloorstanding loudspeakersand there are also a growing number of consumers who have not heeded the RTO charge from their employers and continue to work from home and desire something for the desktop or their office.\nNone of these loudspeakers priced below $499 will break the bank, but don\u2019t forget that almost all of them will benefit from using higher quality amplification; either an existing amplifier that you might own, or something from our list of integrated amplifiers.\nBuilding a system is a process and it\u2019s not a bad move to find a pair of loudspeakers and amplifier that you prefer before blowing the rest of your budget on sources and cables.\nI can hear the laughter around the globe, but 99% of you have never listened to the original Dayton Audio B652 or the B652-AIR that utilizes a 1\u2033 x 1\u2033 mini AMT tweeter with surprisingly good results.\nJust how good can a $60 USD pair of loudspeakers be?\nThe black ebony pica vinyl cabinet isn\u2019t winning any industrial design awards but were you really expecting a pair of Sonus faber Amati for $60?\nThe 6.5-inch woofer offers relatively robust bass considering the size of the sealed cabinet and the 87 dB sensitivity (6 ohms) makes these rather easy to drive. The roll-off below 70Hz is rather noticeable, but that makes them a great candidate for an inexpensive subwoofer or as a pair of loudspeakers in a bedroom or on the desktop.\nThe treble can be somewhat peaky on the B652, but we did not find that to be the case with the AMT tweeter which is smoother sounding, and far more detailed.\nA vintage receiver would drive the hell out of these fun loudspeakers and a warmer tonal balance would certainly be preferable.\nWhere to buy:$60/pairat Parts Express\nThe new C3GM bookshelf loudspeakers replace the best-selling CG3 that were discontinued in 2022 and it\u2019s almost impossible to find a better pair of loudspeakers at the price; RSL sells all of their products direct to consumers and there is enormous value here for $120 USD/pair.\nThe C3GM work well on both stands or a desktop; the loudspeakers do not take up a lot of space (9.5\u201dH x 5.3\u2033D x 6.7\u201dW) and there is a keyhole mount for those who might wish to mount them on a wall and use them as rear channel speakers.\nThe 4-inch mineral-filled woven aramid fiber cone\u00a0woofer and 1-inch silk dome tweeter offer a fairly robust sound, but there is noticeable roll-off around 90Hz making these ideal candidate for a subwoofer.\nThe 86.5 dB (6 ohms) sensitivity is on the lower side but they will work just fine with 30-50 watts; and they certainly won\u2019t implode if you drive them with 100 to 125 watts of power either.\nA clean sounding pair of bookshelf loudspeakers with above average detail and speed considering the entry-level price tag.\nWhere to buy:$210/pairat RSL\nAndrew Jones set the entry-level category ablaze a few years ago when he was tasked with creating something that audiophiles could sink their teeth into for less than $400. Not only did the acclaimed loudspeaker designer build out a rather impressive niche for the brand, he forced the competition to rethink what could be done for very little. Jones has moved on to MoFi \u2014 but we still have the Elac Debut 2.0 B5.2 to recommend for less than $300 depending on where you find them.\nThe 86 dB sensitivity rating (6 ohms) might feel like it\u2019s on the low side but this is one pair of bookshelf loudspeakers than can work with a rather wide range ofamplifiersandAVRs.\nThe 5.25-inch woven aramid fiber bass driver and 1-inch soft-dome tweeter delivers deep impactful bass and rather smooth and extended top end performance that makes these suitable for both music and movies.\nIf you have to place the Debut 2.0 B5.2 close to the wall behind them, Jones wisely put the bass ports on the front of the cabinet allowing for greater flexibility when it comes to room placement.\nThe 46Hz \u2013 35kHz frequency response is rather accurate and you would be surprised just how deep these bookshelf loudspeakers can go with the right amplifier.\nWe don\u2019t love the black ash vinyl finish, but the MDF cabinet is extensively braced and these are rather well built for the money. Elac sold a lot of these because they are cohesive sounding, detailed, and far more expressive than the average entry-level loudspeaker.\nWhere to buy:$330/pairat ELAC\nThe Triangle Borea BR03 BT made our \u201cBest Wireless Speakers of 2022\u201d list and after 2 months with them \u2014 I\u2019m certainly buying them when the tax refund check arrives in February.\nThe passive version are even more impressive and less than 50% of the price which makes them one of the easiest recommendations of 2023. The Borea BR03 are rather agile sounding loudspeakers, although I do wish that the 1-inch silk dome tweeter was slightly better behaved depending on the amplifier.\nThe 6.2-inch woofer has more than enough extension and scale to make orchestral and classic rock selections come alive in my 16\u2032 x 13\u2032 x 9\u2032 den.\nClarity, detail, and a rather high level of resolution makes these one of our favorite loudspeakers on the list because they really respond well to integrated amplifiers in the $650 to $1,500 range and you would never guess how affordable they are.\nThe 90 dB sensitivity (4 ohms) is slightly deceptive and we would suggest 50 watts as a minimum to really give these vibrant loudspeakers the foundation they need. Triangle has a done a great job with the Borea range and these are still flying under the radar for most people which we find a tad strange.\nWhere to buy:$300/pairat Adorama\nVery much like Jason Statham\u2019s character inLock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, the Q Acoustics 3020i are a tad unleashed. They communicate music like an effortless weapon, and with some serious punch in the lower registers with the right amplifier. They borrow some of their driver technology from their much larger sibling; theQ Acoustics 3050i floor-standing loudspeakerthat retails for almost three times the price.\nQ Acoustics have tweaked something in the cabinet design and crossover of the 3020i making it hit much harder than one would expect considering the size of the cabinet and drivers.\nThe 3020i s not a very difficult loudspeaker to drive (88 dB, 6 ohms) but it definitely benefits from an amplifier with some grip and midrange punch. Stay away from amps that veer dark because the 1-inch soft-dome tweeter needs some illumination.\nAvailable in Graphite Grey, English Walnut, Carbon Black or Arctic White. All are finished with an attractive chrome bezel around each driver and feature magnetic speaker grilles.\nDitch the grille covers and do not use the foam bungs even if you need to place them closer to the wall; the mid bass and lower midrange loses some of clarity in the process. The price has increased over the past 12 months which is a shame because these are very fine loudspeakers.\nWhere to buy:$449/pairat Paducah Home Theater\nTherevised AE100 MK2(also referred to as MKII or AE1002) from Acoustic Energy are a very balanced sounding bookshelf loudspeaker with fantastic build quality and excellent punch. They might not be the last word in the lower registers but they can still deliver the goods for only $399 USD.\nFor more information: Read ourAE100 MK2 Review.\nWhere to buy:$399/pair at Sound Seller LLC|\u00a3259/pair at Audio Affair\nThe Diamond series receives a facelift every 3-4 years, and the newDiamond 12 seriesproducts are already proving to be a massive hit.\nWharfedale understands that most consumers don\u2019t have a lot of space and are working within a very specific budget when buying a hi-fi system.\nThere are specific brands of electronics that work exceptionally well with Wharfedale\u2019s loudspeakers; Audiolab, Croft, Marantz, Cambridge Audio, Quad, Rega, and NAD.\nThe Wharfedale Diamond 12.1\u2019s are the ideal size for a desktop loudspeaker or placement on a credenza in a home office scenario.\nThese stand-mounters are a two-way, bass-reflex\u00a0design. The\u00a05-inch mid/bass driver\u00a0uses a polypropylene/mica composite cone material, and the tweeter is a 1-inch textile dome design that offers a very smooth sounding top end and excellent dispersion.\nWhere to buy:$449/pairat Wharfedale\nThe Danish manufacturer is now distributed by Lenbrook in N. America and that situation makes them much easier to find. DALI makes excellent loudspeakers across the board but their affordable Spektor 2 is a fantastic value and wonderful platform for a wide range of amplifiers.\nThe Spektor 2 offer an insightful, detailed, and very expressive presentation. They are not overly fussy about placement, but they can be rather underwhelming with low powered amplifiers. Anything above 50 watts per channel should be quite sufficient.\nWhere to buy:$499/pairat Music Direct\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission.\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "title": "Dante\u2019s HiFi Sound \u2013 LoFi Approach with Rich Medina",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/dantes-hifi-rich-medina/",
        "content": "In the fall of \u201822, we flew to Miami, the Magic City, after learning of a new kind of listening bar that had emerged in the city\u2019s Wynwood neighborhood. Co-founded by a team of nightlife veterans alongside legendary DJ, spoken word artist, journalist, and producerRich Medina,Dante\u2019s HiFiis the city\u2019s first jazz-kissa-inspired listening bar \u2013\u2013 and unlike any other hi-fi bar we\u2019ve visited in either the United States or Japan.\nEquipped with a custom-built analog sound system featuring Klipsch speakers, vintage Cary tube amplification, and Master Sounds rotary, Dante\u2019s serves up \u201chifi sound with a lofi approach\u201d to a Miami crowd typically accustomed to bottle service and pounding club music. Their unique take on the \u201clistening room\u201d puts equal emphasis on listening, dance music, DJ culture, and music education. During our visit, the night flowed naturally from full album-sides of jazz classics to DJ sets featuring a mix of latin music, disco, boogie, and house with one of the residents picking up the mic at various points to interact with the crowd. Somehow, everyone in the room knew exactly what to do at all times throughout the night.\nMedina, the music director, master of ceremonies, and originator of this new approach to the listening room, was out of town during our visit, but his presence was made known through the 10,000 records from the Lakewood-born, NYC-raised DJ\u2019s personal collection housed behind the bar.\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing\u2019s Phil Cho recently caught up with Medina to learn more about the bar\u2019s ethos, musical roots, education in a jazz kissa context, Miami\u2019s music scene, and Dante\u2019s constantly evolving music program.\nHey Rich! To start\u2026 Miami\u2019s music scene is, of course, very club focused. How did the idea first come together to create a spot that was dedicated to listening and sound?\nA few years ago, my partners went to Japan and really experienced jazz kissa culture for the first time. They had been to them in the past, but never went with the specific intention to understand what the culture was about. After a couple days of going to as many kissas as possible, they convinced themselves that they wanted to open one in Miami.\nMy three other partners are all successful venue owners and/or entrepreneurs already, so they have a vocabulary about how these things work, but there was a missing player with who was going to represent the brand musically so that we don\u2019t move too far away from the Japanese tradition, but also put a thing on it that makes it uniquely ours. That\u2019s where I entered the conversation. After months of Zooms, looking at CAD drawings, talking about the business, and all of that, next thing I know I\u2019m packing up my shit and on my way to Florida. They\u2019re the right guys for the opportunity. Praise God that the call came my way. I feel like I\u2019m the right guy for the job to finish off that team. It\u2019s been fantastic.\nEducation seems to be a key element of the Dante\u2019s Hi-Fi experience along with having an MC (master of ceremonies). Can you talk about your background as an MC and how that culture/history informs Dante\u2019s?\nMy background as an MC goes all the way back to my grandfather\u2019s church and growing up in a space of men of the cloth (preachers, deacons, reverends) and particular teachers who made it a point to me as a young child to recognize that I have a way of making a point. You tell a kid they got something and then you nurture it and you let the kid run with it. If the kid really loves it, it\u2019s just the water out of the faucet.\nI\u2019m 53, so I grew up in the \u201870s and \u201880s forty minutes south of Manhattan. I\u2019m a member of the Zulu nation. I\u2019m a member of the Rocksteady crew. I\u2019ve been B-boying my whole life. Whether it\u2019s MC-ing from a secular hip-hop disposition, or reggae disposition, or the church, or the school assembly, I\u2019ve always had a thing for orators and people who can bring an idea to you that you never heard before. They make you feel like you get it a little bit and inspire you to leave and go do your own recon on it to see if it\u2019s for you or not.\nMy relationship with MC-ing is deeply rooted. I\u2019ve also been a writer, writing for magazines, decades of poetry performances, and all of those things. With Dante\u2019s, I now have a place where all that work and experience has someplace really redeeming to come home to roost. Then, when you apply it to the jazz kissa culture, it\u2019s a new audience. Damn near everybody under the sun here is a new audience to that game.\nIf you can share music with the right humility and make eye contact with the right new person in the room, you know that you got somebody in front of you that\u2019s probably going to be in a record store in the next 48 hours.\nFor people that have never been to the bar, can you take us through how you incorporate the educational aspect into a typical bar night?\nIt could be anything. I could stop the music, talk about who we are and how long we\u2019ve been here, ask the room how many people are here for the first time, give them a quick bullet-point breakdown of who we are, what the inspiration for the place comes from, express our appreciation for them coming in to rock with us, and get back to playing music. I could play a song and stop the record and tell you why this record is so important to me. \u201cI got this record in San Francisco ten years ago for $5. Now it goes for $300 on Discogs because of X-Y-Z whatever.\u201d Just data about the music.\nIf you\u2019re into music or you\u2019re listening to music, you\u2019re at least curious who the artist is. If you\u2019re listening to music in an analog way, you\u2019re probably reading the liner notes. You start to become this active piece of liner notes for people. Liner notes for what the culture is about in general and what our intent is within the culture. Pioneering that type space within the kissa culture has been vital to satisfying people\u2019s curiosities about what exactly this is.\nSo it seems like you approach it as a free-flowing conversation?\nFor me it\u2019s free flowing because I\u2019ve been MC-ing my own parties as a resident DJ across the span of my career. The parties that I grew up with were steeped in the old school tradition. Coke La Rock and Kool Herc\u2026 \u201cThrow your hands in the air, wave them like you just don\u2019t care.\u201d The people that did that, the people on the other side of that statement that actually put their hands in the air and waved them like they didn\u2019t fucking care. Those are the motherfuckers you\u2019re talking to. That\u2019s the root of the tree. They\u2019re the ones that make the wall flowers loosen up. You can\u2019t do with records what the guy standing next to the stiff guy can do with a physical reaction. So it\u2019s the truth in the engagement of the community.\nWe\u2019re not up there telling you what to do or dictating to you how things are going to be. Your energy, what you think, and how you see this space is important too. We want you to know that in this space, we acknowledge how smart you are musically because even if you don\u2019t know any of these records, you\u2019re smart enough to know to stick around because you\u2019re going to hear something you like or know soon enough.\nI was in Philly for the last 30 years, so it\u2019s Cash Money and Marvelous. It\u2019s Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince. It\u2019s all the Notorious forward DJs in Philadelphia who became touring DJs always having an emcee, not a rapper, a master of ceremonies. So it\u2019s tradition from the crib, as well. Taking New York, Philly and Jersey and implanting that energy here in Miami. It stands out because we\u2019re not there, we\u2019re in Florida. Bringing that seasoned club disposition to the table inside of a hi-fi bar \u2013 it\u2019s bulletproof if you execute it with the right intent.\nEverybody that you come across in the room is the most important guy in the room. Talk to people with respect. Keep it simple, keep it pushing. Avoid the goofy shit.\nEven being there just one night, I could feel there were people around who came specifically to listen and learn.\nMy thing is, I\u2019ll tell you what the record is, where it\u2019s from, what it costs, then it\u2019s good luck from there\u2026 It also allows the line to remain drawn as well, but the only line is professional vs. hobbyist, and even that isn\u2019t a greater-than-less-than conversation, it\u2019s just the delta. Right? To make the hobbyist intrigued by the in-depth considerations that we make with regard to the records and how a room sounds \u2013 it becomes like a bottomless pit of sharing. If you can share music with the right humility and make eye contact with the right new person in the room, you know that you got somebody in front of you that\u2019s probably going to be in a record store in the next 48 hours.\nThey\u2019ve never seen or held a record in their whole life, and now it\u2019s stuck to them. It\u2019s like they\u2019re seeing an elephant inside of a building in America, and thinking, \u201cwhat is going on here?\u201d Then that guy is back the next week and the week after and he\u2019s got this look on his face like, \u201cYeah, okay, you played a record by so and so and I researched it on my phone and I went to some record store a couple of blocks from here. They had all these records made by this artist. It was so great.\u201d\nI have these conversations with people that are new to digging all the time now. That\u2019s just priceless, man. I mean, there\u2019s something to be said for keeping some things to yourself at times, but in an environment like ours, we want to lift that veil like the information is there for you, too. All you gotta do is want it.\nI love Dante\u2019s tagline \u201cHIFI SOUND / LOFI APPROACH\u201d Can you elaborate on this philosophy?\nWe serve you craft cocktails and we present you craft music. The \u201clo-fi\u201d part just means treating the place as precious as it should be treated, but to not be precious about it. Everybody that you come across in the room is the most important guy in the room. Talk to people with respect. Keep it simple, keep it pushing. Avoid the goofy shit. So that\u2019s \u201clo-fi.\u201d That humility of approach means that we are a watering hole forallmusic lovers, from the most experienced to the most inexperienced. If you have questions, somebody within three bodies of you can help you get to the answer that you\u2019re looking for.\nIf you\u2019re the person that wants the optics of being seen, the people who are running the place are personable enough that, as long as you approach them with some etiquette, you\u2019re going to get an exchange. So if the intent is to share information and the intent is to enjoy this experience together. It\u2019s not the servers versus the clientele. It all works together. Keeping that out in front of the intent has done wonders for us in terms of the way people talk about us and why.\nThe hi-fi heads that frequent our site will definitely be curious about the sound system, so I gotta ask: What makes up the system at Dante\u2019s? I especially loved the care and small details put into the DJ booth.\nLooking at the schedule, it\u2019s clear that the selection at Dante\u2019s is meant to be diverse and the DJs focus on all genres of music. Can you talk about a few of the zones you guys have explored recently in terms of music selection/selectors? Any favorite regular nights?\nAs music director, it\u2019s been a blessing to be able to bring all my experience to the place. I bring in all types of guest selectors, explain what we do, and they come in there and it really swings them back. They really feel happy about being there. They feel appreciative that there\u2019s a space where they feel like the music director is not trying to be a program director and tell them what to play. The music director brought me here because they like what I do, or they want to give me a shot. Both of those people have room here.\nIn terms of special nights, man, it\u2019s so much stuff. I mean, Dave Chappelle coming in town and calling us on a Monday night, asking if we can open up. He\u2019s like, \u201cEverybody\u2019s been to Dante\u2019s but me!\u201d We were sitting there for two and a half hours, Dave Chappelle and I on a freestyle. Just Dave Chappelle talking shit. It was fucking amazing. For the residencies, there\u2019s Ladies Night, Record Shop Sessions, Holy Smoke (gospel & spiritual jazz), La Cura (latin diaspora), Dvize, Lumin, and Marcello Bentine\u2019s Brazilian Sessions, Rum & Coke (tropicalia). I don\u2019t want to leave anyone out, but it\u2019s just been a constant barrage of exciting moments because at any given night, there might be somebody on the bill that nobody really knows yet, and they might be playing the earlier slot of the night, but they\u2019re a fucking wizard in the box.\nSometimes you get a big name in the room that\u2019s playing at peak time, and they\u2019re a little bit nervous on the rotary. You watch somebody very established who\u2019s used to play in big rooms and big arenas, and you give them an intimate environment like ours where people are right on top of you and it\u2019s a whole different kind of pressure. It\u2019s a whole different kind of animal to fight. So it\u2019s hard to call out all the highlights.\nArt Basel this year was probably the biggest impact moment for us yet. We had two systems set up the whole week, outside in the courtyard and inside the bar. So having that outdoor ignited with 9th Wonder, Digging Through The Crates, Alize, B-Sharp, Dvize, Lumin, Quantic, J Rocc, Maceo, Louie Vega, Osunlade. It was an unbelievable week, but yeah day to day it\u2019s always something\u2026\nOne night, I walked in the room at 7:30 and one of the bartenders was brave enough to get the ladder and pull a couple records out of a shelf they\u2019d been staring at. They\u2019re playing something in the room that I haven\u2019t played in five years that\u2019s a banger. It\u2019s a go-to joint in my mind, but I haven\u2019t touched it in years. So it comes across the whole bell curve whether it\u2019s somebody who comes through the door, a song that comes through the speaker, or just a person who came in here who looked unhappy and then 30 minutes later they\u2019re smiling with a drink and rocking to the music.\nHow has the city responded to this new type of music space?\nI think that we\u2019ve impacted the club culture in Miami in a very positive way. You asked me about the \u201clo-fi approach\u201d earlier. Just being sophisticated, approachable, and simple at the same time has kind of taken people aback a little bit because they come expecting club energy. They come expecting the beach club, and we\u2019re nothing like that. You feel like you\u2019re walking into a speakeasy somewhere deep in Brooklyn. You don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re in Miami. You feel like you could be anywhere because it\u2019s something that you haven\u2019t experienced in the city before. We\u2019ve been getting that energy from people in government to local police to patrons to other businesses that surround us physically on our block. We\u2019ve brought bodies to an area of Wynwood that didn\u2019t really have that type of traffic for a very long time. Also, when you\u2019re inside of the development or gentrification machine, and you\u2019re actually doing something culturally redeeming, you don\u2019t feel so bad about being there.\nLastly, we love sharing as much music as possible in our articles\u2026 Can you share five records you\u2019ve played recently at Dante\u2019s?\nDante\u2019s HiFi:https://danteshifi.com/\nRich Medina:https://richmedina.com/\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/vintage-audio-gear-archives/",
        "content": "It\u2019s true. Those wanting to better understand stereo reproduction, find the most desirable gear, learn how seminal audio products by Acoustic Research, Klipsch, Garrard, and Pioneer were contemporaneously reviewed, and luxuriate in design-rich advertisements for nearly every notable stereo component since the birth of hi-fi audio in the 1950s need only do an online search to find troves of fascinating information. The best archive isWorld Radio History. Despite its clumsy web design, its database is filled with dozens of magazine titles devoted to music\u2013\u2013whether making it, recording it, listening to it or assessing it.\nTake, for example, the 1950s magazineAudiocraft. An early maker\u2019s magazine written for amateur audiophiles interested in building their own stereo amplifiers and speakers, it offers wildly informative tips on everything from basic electronics and tonearm weighting to speaker placement and the pros and cons of contour controls. Are you a speaker buff interested in building a rear-loading corner horn enclosure? Good news: TheMarch 1958 issuehas an easy-to-follow how-to. (See above.)\nOr this fascinating tidbit: Editors experimented with speaker placement, assessing sound quality in a blind listening test. (The surprising result is identified in the caption.)\nHigh Fidelitymagazine was published for nearly 50 years. It offered a fount of information about listening, fidelity, and audio engineering. Best, because it was geared toward a mass market audience discovering the wonder of hi-fi listening and stereo reproduction, the magazine\u2019s articles and various explainers were written in relatively clear language. The publication blossomed in the 1960s.\nIn 1972, audio expert William Boyce published an updated edition of hisHi-Fi Stereo Handbook, which he original wrote in 1957 and also updated in \u201961 and \u201967. Next time you\u2019ve got a few hours to spare, read it. You\u2019ll come away with a much deeper understanding of audio, sound, and listening strategies.\nThe 1970s were boom times for component manufacturers, as competition from emergent Japanese manufacturers created a kind of arms race. The full-color double-truck ads are impressive\u2013\u2013and incredibly informative when looking for vintage gear today.\nPeruse issues and discover covetable turntables galore. Looking for small-batch vintage gear? Search old magazines for obscure brands that other potential bidders might miss.\nBonus: You can learn about how electronics fared during the Nixon administration.\nDiscover your own gems atWorldRadioHistory.\nAudiocraft:https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Audio/Audiocraft_Magazine.htm\nHigh Fidelity:https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Audio/High-Fidelity-Magazine.htm\nHi-Fi World:https://worldradiohistory.com/Hi-Fi-World-UK.htm\nHi-Fi / Stereo Review:https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Audio/HiFI-Stereo-Review.htm"

        "title": "The Rebirth of Mirage Loudspeakers?",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/the-rebirth-of-mirage-loudspeakers/",
        "content": "If you are old enough to remember\u00a0Mirage\u00a0Loudspeakers (or follow \u201980s vintage hi-fi) \u2014 this might prove to be very exciting news. Over the weekend, we were alerted by industry insiders that Premium Audio Company (PAC) COO, Oscar Bernardo, was leaving the company to relaunch Mirage.\nDo you remember the storied Canadian brand that was eventually acquired by Audio Products International?\nBose tried to acquire Mirage prior to the API purchase but it never came to fruition.\nMirage was started back in 1979 by Jeff Percy, Jeff Soltysek, and Patrick Dempster. What a lot of audiophiles probably don\u2019t know is that famed loudspeaker designer, Kevin Voecks (Revel, Snell Acoustics), created the original Mirage loudspeaker designs.\nThe first few years for Mirage were focused on rather high quality, but affordable two-way loudspeakers that did relatively well in the marketplace.\nVoecks, who owned another loudspeaker company in the United States, sold that business and moved to Toronto to become the lead designer at Mirage.\nThe aforementioned Bose acquisition fell through when the Toronto group realized that it would mean that the company would be relocated to Massachusetts and there wasn\u2019t a lot of support for that internally.\nThe brand was fortunate to secure private financing to expand its manufacturing capabilities and develop a proper dealer network in the United States; something that became a problem when demand outstripped their ability to create product fast enough after a series of very positive reviews in the high-end press.\nToo much success has killed more than a few high-end brands which lacked the ability to scale up their operations.\nThe Mirage M-1 Loudspeakers were the pinnacle of their design philosophy and a huge success.\nAPI were assembling Mirage\u2019s loudspeakers so the acquisition made logistical sense when it finally occurred.\nThe Klipsch Group purchased API, but Mirage never really found its legs again and the brand died a rather unceremonious death; unless being sold in empty Magnolia showrooms counts as market presence.\nThe rebirth of Mirage could be a very good thing if the new products live up to the pedigree of the M-1 and smaller models in the series.\nBefore joining the organization in 2006, Bernardo\u00a0served in executive and management positions focused on operations at Audio Products International (maker of the Mirage, Energy and Athena speaker brands), Fineline Circuits Limited and Campeau Corporation. He also holds an HBA and MBA from the University of Western Ontario.\nIn his new endeavor, Oscar is going back to his roots by pursuing his unyielding passion for Canadian audio. He has purchased the iconic Mirage speaker brand with plans to restore its status as the innovator in setting new standards in speaker design and performance.\nThe Mirage legacy began in Canada in 1977 when a small group of devout audiophiles made it their mission to develop a speaker that could deliver a soundstage so natural, audiences would forget they were listening to a product, rather than a live event. The Mirage name is synonymous with immersive, 360\u00ba sound experiences.\nWhile traditional speakers focus on direct sound dispersion, Mirage Omnipolar\u00a0products capture the impact of reflective sound. \u201cOscar is a dedicated, respected, and trusted leader that has made significant contributions to the success of our company,\u201d said Paul Jacobs, president and CEO of Premium Audio Company.\n\u201cHe has\u00a0been integral in carrying out the company\u2019s vision and developing new ways to create, distribute, and sell the most exciting high-performance audio entertainment products around the world. I am confident he will rebuild the Mirage speaker brand to the greatness it deserves,\u201d Jacobs continued.\nWe look forward to seeing what Oscar Bernardo can achieve with Mirage based on his track record over the past 35 years in the high-end loudspeaker category.\nMore Info on Mirage:https://www.stereophile.com/floorloudspeakers/689mirage/\nWebsite:https://www.miragespeakers.com/\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission.\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "content": "Thevintage audiotheme remained very popular with both consumers and manufacturers in 2022; Klipsch, Wharfedale, Mission, and Leak introduced loudspeakers and electronics that offer a blast from the past (minus the shag) but with modern updates and rather expensive price tags. Leak\u2019s original Stereo 30 Integrated Amplifier was a rather coveted piece of equipment that found itself in more than a few London flats.\nLeak was resurrected in 2020 during the height of the pandemic and has continued to expand the lineup based on the growing demand for \u201cvintage\u201d components which has become a hot category for IAG Group; the parent company of Leak, Wharfedale, Mission, Audiolab, and Quad.\nMission recently launched an updated version of its778x Integrated Amplifier, along with theMission 770 loudspeakerswhich sold out in a matter of months.\nThe Leak Stereo 230 offers a slightly different take on the original Stereo 30 and current Stereo 130.\nThe new Leak Stereo 230 Integrated Amplifier offers an increase in power (2 x 75W per channel vs 2 x 45W), upgraded analog and digital circuits, and a revised DAC section that supportshi-res audiostreaming,MQA, and 22.58MHz DSD. The DAC also supports up to 32-bit/768kHz (PCM).\nThe Stereo 230 offers support for Bluetooth 5.0, aptX and AAC codecs.\nJust like the Mission 778x, the Leak Stereo 230 includes a MM phono preamp which is designed to work with anyMM cartridge and high output MC cartsas well.\nLeak have also designed the Stereo 230 to act as a hub for your 2.0 home theater system with a wide range of inputs including HDMI ARC, Toslink Optical, and USB-B. There are also two analog connections for a pair of headphones and 1 pair of RCA inputs for a CD player.\nThe Leak Stereo 230 amps will be available from January 2023 priced at \u00a31249 / $1699 / $2699 with the walnut enclosure (\u00a31099 / $1499 / $2399 without).\nFor more information:leak-hifi.co.uk/stereo230/\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission.\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/stereos-modern-marvels/",
        "content": "Cheesy 1990s graphics? Check. Dated approach to documentary TV? Obviously. Woefully America-centric view of stereophonic sound\u2019s evolution? Certainly! Snobbish, mansplaining white-dude talking heads? Of course.\nAll of this can be true and you can still find much to absorb in the \u2018Stereos\u2019 episode of the series Modern Marvels. Filled with information that lays out the basics of stereophonic sound reproduction and the ways in which inventors and sound geeks changed how we listen to music, the 45-minute documentary, which originally aired on the History Channel, offers a primer on the birth and evolution of recorded sound and the rise of high-fidelity stereo systems \u2013 at least the Westernized version of this history.\nStarting with the birth of the medium, the episode delivers its information in easily digestible chunks, with clunky computer graphics, synth-driven library music, an authoritative, deep voiced narrator and lots of Ken Burns-ian pans of old photos.\nOnce you get over the dated style, though, it\u2019s got a lot of great data and first-hand recollections, most notably from speaker builder Henry Kloss, whose work with Acoustic Research, KLH, and Advent helped transform enthusiasts such as himself into pioneers of sound reproduction.\n\u2018Stereos\u2019 also lays out the basics of vinyl recording in a way that\u2019s simple to understand; you\u2019ll exit the episode understanding why 45-degree angles play a crucial role in record playback and amplification, and the ways in which the CD revolution transformed, for better and worse, the business of recording. You also might notice the unfortunate truth that, despite the absolute dominance of Japanese audio companies in the 1970s, none are acknowledged in the episode until Sony earns a mention as leading the ascent of the CD. (Hey, it\u2019s the History Channel, what do you want?)\nHere\u2019s the episode. Note: Though the clip runs 75 minutes, the doc is about half that in length and repeats twice (probably for some algorithmic reason).\nAnd, just because, below is a YouTube clip of the first ever stereophonic sound recording, which is referenced in the Modern Marvels episode. From the video\u2019s notes:\n\u201cThis is the first single groove stereo recording, produced at Bell\u2019s Telephone Laboratories in New York City on June 1, 1934. AC Keller and IS Rafuse had already conceived a way of separating high and low frequencies and recording them on parallel tracks on the same record. Later they found a way of recording two complete sound tracks and reproducing both tracks simultaneously using a single pickup. From this came two full-range bands from left and right microphones in the same groove. In this recording you will hear Bell Lab employees Ted R. D. Collins, Harley A. Henning, and the inventor Arthur C. Keller. The stereo technique was patented by Keller and Rafuse in 1938.\u201d\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

Those who celebrate Christmas are facing a serious deadline for grabbing the perfect gift for the hi-fi head and those who celebrate Hanukah are already in the thick of it. You are out of time, but you still want to find a present that shows you care.\nBelow, some quick-hit ideas that might assuage your guilt at procrastinating and delight your beloved deep listener with your thoughtfulness. Another idea: order two of each and keep one for yourself as evidence of your deep commitment to your own well-being.\nYes, we are highlighting a few items of our own among these recommendations, but mostly because we\u2019ve only got a few left and want to remind you that they\u2019re running out: Our large, heavy duty canvas tote with extra-long natural web handles fits around 50 records \u2013 and some extra room for a water bottle, canister or sweater.

The Numark PT01 is a standard at this point when you want to listen to an LP before you buy it, either to check quality or because the rarity you just found isn\u2019t even on YouTube yet.\nPer Turntable Lab\u2019s sales pitch: \u201cIt\u2019s a good deal all around. The Numark PT01 follows the basic principles of vintage portable models, but adds\u00a0several modern conveniences\u00a0which older portables lack: USB and RCA output, hi/low tone control, and +/- 10% pitch control. In addition, the PT01 has the basics down solid \u2013 33, 45 & 78 rpm play so you can listen to basically any record you find, the inclusion of both 3.5mm and 1/4\u201d headphone inputs so you can listen with whatever headphones you got (or the built-in loudspeaker), plus the ability to run on battery or included power plug\u00a0is crucial.

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/ohm-acoustics-loudspeakers-the-budget-audiophiler/",
        "content": "There is a wonderful scene inBoschwhen after a long day on the job, Detective Bosch returns home to his glass house on the hill overlooking Los Angeles and puts on a jazz record. Harry (played by Titus Welliver) stares out onto the sprawling city below and sits down to lose himself in the music coming out of his Ohm Acoustics Walsh loudspeakers. I may not have such a striking view of the City of Angels every night, but Harry and I share the same loudspeakers. Ohm loudspeakers that have been manufactured in Brooklyn for almost 50 years.\n\u201cTell me what I spend so much time dealing with you? \u2013 Harry Bosch\nNo loudspeaker is perfect, and the Ohm loudspeakers are not without their faults, but it is their intrinsic ability to emotionally move me with music that makes them impossible to replace.\nThe Ohm Walsh are only one chapter in my journey with the brand, but the one that I am fortunate enough to return to every single day.\nHow did I get here?\nMy love for Ohm loudspeakers began with a simple phone call. I had purchased a used pair of Ohm Fs knowing that they would require some level of repair. The Brooklyn-based loudspeaker manufacturer still supports its legacy loudspeakers; even those manufactured and sold 40 years ago. How many high-end brands do that?\nThe man on the other end of the line was Ohm President, John Strohbeen. I don\u2019t expect to speak with Jeff Bezos or Steve Cook, if I have a problem with an Amazon purchase or Apple product, but having your questions answered by the person in-charge inspires confidence.\nHarry Weisfeld, former CEO of VPI Industries, was renown for spending hours on the phone with customers helping them with their questions, so it\u2019s good to know that this practice is still alive in the world of consumer electronics.\nI told him about my recent purchase and his bold reply was, \u201ccongratulations for purchasing one of the finest speakers ever made.\u201d He detailed the different options for upgrading the loudspeaker, but unfortunately Ohm no longer services the 18\u201d titanium and aluminium Walsh driver. I would have to look elsewhere if I wanted to keep the original driver.\nOhm Acoustics was founded in 1971 by Marty Gersten, former Chief Engineer at Rectilinear, and four other partners using the exclusive patents held by Lincoln Walsh; the inventor of the\u00a0\u201cCoherent Wave Transmission Line Driver.\u201d The Walsh Driver as it is more commonly known. Rectilinear declined to license the Walsh patent and Gersten made a deal with Strohbeen who wanted to sell the new Ohm Acoustics loudspeakers in his stores.\nJohn Strohbeen became president of Ohm Acoustics in 1978; Strohbeen\u2019s career in hi-fi began in his dorm room at MIT where he started Tech HiFi in 1964; one of the first high-end stereo stores where you could purchase Japanese audio equipment.\nThe Ohm A/F was their first creation and is still regarded as one of the best loudspeakers ever made. Perhaps not as famous in some circles as the Quad ESLs, but a very unique and innovative design that has plenty of admirers.\nIn 1981, Ohm Acoustics left the retail market pivoting to direct sales only relying on customer word of mouth and offering a 120-day home trial period. To this day, they still manufacture new loudspeakers and service their legacy loudspeaker lines out of their Brooklyn warehouse.\nFast forward to 2021 and I now own five pairs of Ohm Acoustics loudspeakers, an Ohm shirt, and an Ohm belt buckle. How many audiophiles own a Krell, Wilson, or Vandersteen belt buckle?\nNeedless to say I am a massive fan of Ohm, and the way John Strohbeen runs his company. I had hesitations that my $200 Facebook Marketplace find wouldn\u2019t be worth Ohm\u2019s time to even discuss \u2014 I could not have been more wrong.\nMost high-end audio manufacturers started as small companies and it wasn\u2019t enough to just offer unique products; they had to deliver superior customer service to earn your loyalty. Companies like Ohm Acoustics have never forgotten this.\nMy Ohm F\u2019s were purchased sight unseen with only a somewhat fuzzy picture of the logo. I violated all of my rules in the case of this particular product. Shame on me.\nMuch to my chagrin, their appearance out of the box did not convey the reality of their operational issues. They appeared to be in great shape minus the surrounds that exhibited evidence of dry rot. The seller had all of the original paperwork from 1973 and the original packaging as well. I brought them home and connected them to my system expecting musical ecstasy.\nSilence.\nAnd not the good kind of silence when everyone leaves you alone at home for the day and you can hear your furnace making those odd knocking noises though the floorboards, as you crack open a cold one.\nAfter some audio sleuthing onaudiokarma.org, I found a specialized loudspeaker repair shop outside of Philadelphia, calledMillersound. I send Bill at Millersound an email and he promptly replied with a request for photographs of the Walsh drivers.\nBefore I could send the Ohm Walsh drivers to them, he wanted to ensure that they were in a condition that justified a repair. The drivers could not be creased in any way, and the surrounds had to be the original parts or there was no way to repair them properly.\nAfter close inspection, it was determined that they could be repaired and I packed them carefully in my trunk for the long trek to Philadelphia. Do not even think about shipping these; both from the perspective of cost and the possibility of damage.\nTwo months passed and I received word that the drivers were finally finished. The Walsh driver is quite complex and not something you can fix with some new foam surrounds and call it a day.\n12 hours later (and a lot of miles), we were back home and I reinstalled them in the loudspeaker.\nThese speakers are sublime. They are certainly more elegant than bombastic. Their omnidirectional dispersion pattern fills the room with sound; in a way that forces your brain to readjust to the positioning of spatial cues.\nSetting them up in your room requires some patience and a ruler. I\u2019ve moved them 1/8thof an inch in every direction and noticed a change in the soundstage depth and width; their dispersion pattern interacts with all 4 walls and the smallest changes can have a huge impact on the sound.\nWithin a month I had them dialed in and placed where I liked them the most; 18\u201d from the front wall to the rear of the cabinet. When we\u2019re not using them, I move them back flush against the wall.\nMillersound\u2019s restoration is somewhat of a trade secret, but I do know that only the cone and frame are reused. The rest of the driver is updated. The titanium component of the cone is shaved ever so slightly to ensure that the cone is set perfectly at 90 degrees and a custom made jig is used in the process to ensure the accuracy of the set-up.\nAfter the rebuild, these speakers have proven to be super flexible with amplifiers. I have driven them with as little as 13 watts from the Muzak tube amplifiers and as big as the 300 watts/channel SEA 2500\u2019s. If you do decide to purchase a pair of these, understand that there will be some additional costs to restore them and that you will require a professional to do the work.\nThe Ohm 3XO\u2019s fall into the \u201cWalsh\u201d family of Ohm loudspeakers. The have a omnidirectional low end with a directional tweeter. When set up correctly the \u201cOhm\u201d logo will be on the left speakers and the \u201cWalsh\u201d or \u201c3XO\u201d logo will be on the right speakers. This creates a room sweeping \u201csweet spot\u201d unlike traditional speakers. I had the pair I own updated with new surrounds for the low end and upgraded tweeter from the Ohm factory. Essentially these are now better than new.\nOhm recommends 50-200 watts and my experience is that 60 watts is the minimum amount of power required to really make these speakers come to life. Like the F\u2019s, the placement will alter the sound greatly and these actual came with wheels to make that easier. The 3XO are more domestically friendly with a much smaller footprint measuring 36\u2033 x 13\u2033 x 13\u2033; the larger Walsh F\u2019s are 44\u2033 x 14\u2033 x 14\u2033.\nThe FRS-15 were part of the Ohm lineup in the 1980s. The FRS-15 is a 54\u201d tall square tower with each corner cut about 2\u201d. One of the cut corners near the top, just below the grill, displays the Ohm logo. The FRS-15 is a true Walsh speaker designed for medium to large sized rooms.\nLike the 3XO\u2019s, they have omnidirectional bass response combined with directional tweeters. These speakers can handle up to 250 watts/channel and are rated at 32 \u2013 20,000 Hz (+/-3dB). The 90 dB (6 ohms) sensitivity rating is pretty accurate; I drive them with a pair of 120 watts/channel Luxman power amplifiers and these loudspeakers can play quite loudly. These don\u2019t come up very often on the used market, but they are a deal if you can find a pair in excellent condition. Ohm recommend replacing the foam surrounds every 30 years.\nDon\u2019t be confused by the model designation, because the FRS-7\u2019s are the little sibling to the FRS-15\u2019s in name only. These feature a traditional front facing 6.5\u2033 woofer, 10\u2033 passive radiator on the rear panel, and a 5/8\u201d super-tweeter in the top corner. It makes for a very unique look. Setup is easier as they are not omnidirectional like the loudspeakers above.\nThe sound is dynamic and detailed; Ohm\u2019s recommendation of 25 watts/channel is far too low. I used them for a year with a 45 watts/channel receiver and the sound quality was quite average. When I connected them to my Pilot receiver than can output 80 watts/channel, a different loudspeaker appeared.\nThe super affordableOhm E\u2019swere introduced in the late-1970s and they are one of my favourite Ohm loudspeakers. They sold for $200 at the time and have become quite popular on the used market if they are in good condition. Ohm still offer a number of upgrade options on their website and I find myself using my pair more and more. There is a naturalness to the sound with jazz, classical music, and folk/country/blues that makes them a great pair of loudspeakers for an office, dining room, or bedroom.\nIf you think about it, the ability to have 40 year-old legacy products supported by Ohm Acoustics makes their products rather unique. The Walsh models were quite expensive when they were initially introduced and restoring a pair can be expensive if the drivers are not in great shape.\nI would like to send a special thank you to Jerry, the original owner of my Ohm F\u2019s; for his impeccable taste in audio equipment and to his daughter, Paula, who allowed my family to be the custodian of his Ohm F\u2019s for the next generation.\nFor more information:ohmspeaker.com\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission.\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "content": "Let\u2019s not belabor the point: Ikea\u2019s KALLAX shelving unit, though a sensibly utilitarian storage solution marrying form and function and carrying a modest price-point, is hardly the most breathtaking way to store your records.\nThe ALL-CAPS product is definitely unworthy of the inferred excitement of its name. After all, it only comes in two colors, white and black, and is made of particle board and easily scratchable plastic veneer. Save putting stickers on them, Kallax shelves are tough to personalize.\nThat\u2019s a problem, especially as the vinyl market has evolved from its boom phase into a way of life. As we settle down and settle in, more records require more space, which in turn demands a solution that will showcase our bounty as it protects it from sunlight, warpage, and disorder. It\u2019s not rocket science. They\u2019re shelves. Or units. Or modular boxes.\nSturdy shelves and boxes, in fact, are easy to build. You might even have a woodworking friend who\u2019ll do the job for the price of the lumber and a bottle of Scotch. Also not rocket science? Searching online hubs such as Etsy for accomplished makers willing to do that work for you.\nTake, for example,the DTLA-based builderR/D Record Cabinets, which specializes in forward-facing drawer systems that allow for easy flipping.\nThis is the builder, Paul P.\u2019s, side-gig.

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/part-time-lover/",
        "content": "A few months ago, we took the Pacific Surfliner down the coast to visit one of San Diego\u2019s newest hi-fi bars, Part Time Lover (named after Stevie Wonder\u2019s 1985 hit single). Substantially larger than any listening bar we\u2019d ever been to, the 3,000 sq. ft. space featured a wide array of lounge seating, a full bar stretching across the room, four Klipschorns, two reel-to-reels, a dedicated DJ booth complete with vacuum-powered cleaner, and a record store operating as the satellite location of the legendary Folk Arts Rare Records, one of the oldest record stores in the United States. We arrived late afternoon on a Saturday, just after the bar opened, and the place was already packed with people joyfully conversing over mellow ambient and indie rock.\nA collaborative project, Part Time Lover was made possible by the combined efforts of hospitality group CH Projects, Folk Arts Rare Records, and audio design firm Uncanned Music. Designed like a \u201cdream living room,\u201d the space features a warm and lively east-meets-west aesthetic inspired by the early 20th century American Prairie School architectural style with bar and table lamps custom made by the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation. During the day, record store employees play selections available for sale in the store, and at night, local and visiting DJ\u2019s take over to soundtrack the bar with eclectic sounds ranging from jazz and oldies to disco, reggae, and beyond.\nAfter spending a wonderful night of listening + Japanese hi-balls at Part Time Lover, we reached out to the team behind it to learn more about the project. Below, a short interview with Brendan Boyle of Folk Arts Rare Records, Brian Eastman of CH Projects, and members of Uncanned Music.\nHello Part Time Lover crew! Walking into PTL felt like entering into another world. Can you talk about the inspirations behind opening the space and how Japanese kissa culture is incorporated into the concept?\nWe also love the otherworldly nature of this unique space. Early in the day it\u2019s especially fun to hear Ambient, Modern Composition, Art music, Soundtracks and other experiential sounds. We adore the Japanese kissa concept of \u201cthe listening bar.\u201d We encourage our guest selectors to DJ as they see fit, with the green light to \u201clet it breathe\u201d as well.\nThe design of the bar is gorgeous and seems to mix together a lot of different influences from both Japanese and American architecture. Who designed the bar and can you share a few of the notable elements of the space?\nThe bar was brilliantly designed by Taylor Leage, who heads CH Projects\u2019 Department of Interior Team. Their attention to detail and finished product is wildly impressive. Highlights of the interior space include the acoustics, the ornate columns & the Japanese-inspired lamps.\nPart Time Lover is in many ways powered by the legendary Folk Arts Rare Records store. How did that collaboration come together and how is Folks Arts involved creatively?\nBrendan (Folk Arts): CH Projects\u2019 Arsalun Tafazoli reached out to me in 2020. He clearly had a vision to build something unique for the community of San Diego. Folk Arts has our satellite store in this space, and we curate all of the guest selectors that come in to spin. Between 4pm-10pm or 4pm-8pm seven days a week, we\u2019re creatively spinning \u201csides for sale\u201d at PTL. Our store is dope too. We operate in a DIY style, adding new titles every day of the week.\nWe love that there\u2019s a Folk Arts record shop inside of the bar. Can you recommend five records that are currently available in store?\nBrendan: There are too many great ones but here are five, in no particular order:\nI\u2019m convinced this brilliant LP was a big influence on Sun Ra. One of five albums that Lateef released in 1957. Amazing.\n1970\u2019s avant-garde Japanese Jazz with all of the right bluesy & woozy touches.\nChilled out, barefoot, west coast vibes from one half of Compton & Batteau.\nThese otherworldly piano recordings by this legendary Ethiopian nun have served as a bit of a de facto soundtrack for this space. It never gets old\u2026\nBeing in the record business, you sometimes ask yourself, \u201cHow is this exceptional record still here?\u201d This is the best sounding album in our repertoire. It always elicits an enthusiastic reaction from patrons.\nOf course, I have to ask about the soundsystem. I noticed reel-to-reels are part of the setup? Who designed the system and what are the components (builders, parts, brands)?\nThe soundsystem was brilliantly designed by Uncanned Music. Tons of work was put in by these pros to make sure this system was set up right and it absolutely shows. The sound at PTL is about as good as it gets. People have described the experience to me as a \u2018sound sauna\u2019. The components are:\nUncanned designed a thing of true beauty.\nPeople in San Diego are certainly hungry for a unique, positive experience. I think all of the listening bars in town provide an alternative, more open minded way for people to connect.\nI loved the diverse (and affordable) selection of highballs on the menu. What was the inspiration behind the drink menu?\nBrian Eastman (C.H. Projects): The highballs speak to the simplicity and minimalism of the Japanese listening bar experience. Simple, thoughtful cocktails with quality ingredients meant to be enjoyed over an immersive visit to the space.\nThere seems to be a youthful openness bubbling in San Diego. How has the response been to Part Time Lover and other new bars opening up recently like Goto Convoy music bar and Longplay HiFi?\nPeople in San Diego are certainly hungry for a unique, positive experience. I think all of the listening bars in town provide an alternative, more open minded way for people to connect. These spots aren\u2019t conventional \u201cparty\u201d places but rather nightlife destinations that embrace a slow, spontaneous & joyful energy.\nWhat\u2019s coming up next for the bar? I\u2019ve noticed the booking keeps getting better with incredible locals plus guests from around the world.\nWe hope for the programming at PTL to continue to get more eclectic & diverse into the future. It\u2019s already been quite the ride. Our motivation is fueled by all of the positive experiences PTL has created for San Diego, and there\u2019s most certainly quite a lot of excitement on the horizon.\nRead our article on Listening Bars Around the World:https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/isc-guide-listening-bars/\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "title": "Guide to Subwoofers: Setup Tips, Crossovers, and more",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/guide-to-subwoofers/",
        "content": "In order to experience great sound in a speaker setup, you need speaker drivers that provide clarity, depth, and the ability to provide a full range of audio frequencies.Tweetersare designed to handle high frequencies, theMidrangedriver handles the frequencies associated with vocals, while aWooferhandles the low frequencies. This is referred to as athree-way speaker.\nMany times, especially for compact speakers, the midrange and woofer are combined into a single speaker (aka a2-way speaker).More on 2-way vs 3-way speakers.\nFor movies and bass-heavy music, a woofer may not be able to reproduce all of the low frequencies. To provide more sonic impact (hearing and feeling), you need a subwoofer which is a specific type of speaker that handles only the lowest frequencies that other speakers can\u2019t reproduce.\nIn what is considered a basic surround sound system (5.1 channels), there are five main speakers: Left, Center, Right, Left Surround, and Right Surround. In addition, a\u00a0 subwoofer is assigned to reproduce low frequencies (usually below 120Hz). The subwoofer is associated with the .1 channel.\nTip: The role of the subwoofer is the same regardless of how many channels and speakers are in the rest of your system.\nPassive\nA passive subwoofer needs to be powered by an external amplifier. The external amplifier may be part of an amplifier that powers the rest of the speakers or more typically, an externalsubwoofer amplifierthat is placed between a preamp or home theater receiver (via a subwoofer output) and the speaker terminals of a passive subwoofer.\nPowered\nPowered subwoofers incorporate both the subwoofer speaker driver and an amplifier inside the same enclosure. For the powered subwoofer to work, in addition to AC power, a line output (sub out orLFEout) from a home theater receiver needs to connect to the subwoofer.\nA powered subwoofer takes excessive power load away from the amp/receiver so that the amp/receiver can power the other speakers in a system more efficiently, Most subwoofers used in home theater setups are powered.\nIn addition to how power and audio signals get to a subwoofer, there are other features that the subwoofer has that contribute to its bass role.\nSealed Cabinet: Some subwoofer speaker drivers are enclosed in a sealed enclosure. This means that all of the air is pushed out directly from the speaker driver into the room.\nPassive Radiator: Some subwoofer enclosures incorporate a passive radiator in addition to the speaker. This increases efficiency and preciseness. Passive radiators can either be speakers with the voice coil removed or a flat diaphragm.\nPort:Some subwoofer enclosures offer an additional port. This forces out more air, as it is coming from both the speaker and the port. Some ports may be cylindrical while others might be slotted. This increases bass response in a more efficient manner than sealed enclosures, but may not be as precise. A ported design is referred to asbass reflex.\nA crossover is a circuit that sends frequencies below a specific point to the subwoofer and frequencies above that specific point to the other speakers in the system. 80Hz to 100Hz are commonly used points, but most subwoofers provide additional adjustable crossover points. In addition, most home theater receivers includebass management, which allows further control of what frequencies are sent to the subwoofer.\nDeep-bass frequencies (below 80Hz) are non-directional. This means that human ears have difficulty pinpointing the source location of bass frequencies. This means a subwoofer can be placed in a room where its bass response is best in relation to the size of a room, type of floor (carpet, wood, other), furniture placement, and wall surfaces.\nDepending on the subwoofer, the following connection options may be provided.\nTip: Most powered subwoofers with wired-only connectivity can also be made wireless via an adapter kit that includes a transmitter that plugs into a subwoofer output of a home theater receiver and a receiver that plugs into the subwoofer inputs.\nThe most common spot to place a subwoofer is in front of a room, to the left or right main speakers. However, they can also be placed along a wall or in the back of the room. The key is to place it where it sounds best. You want to minimize the \u201cboomy\u201d base as much as possible. The bass should be deep and tight.\nUse crossover settings to get the best balance between what the subwoofer reproduces in relation to the speakers in the rest of the system. Most subwoofers provide crossover settings. In addition, most home theater or AV receivers providecrossover(akabass management) settings that can further tweak what frequencies are sent to both the main speakers and subwoofer. Read your home theater receiver\u2019s user guide for specific details, but here are some possible options:\nIf you set the main speakers to \u201clarge\u201d and have a subwoofer, low frequencies (LFE and non-LFE) will be sent to both the main speakers and subwoofer.\nTip: Depending on the receiver, when set to large the low frequencies may be sent to the front left/right speakers and subwoofer but not to the center or surround speakers.\nIf you set the main speakers to \u201csmall\u201d all low frequencies, whether they contain a dedicated LFE signal or not will be sent to the subwoofer.\nIf your receiver has an LFE+Main setting option all low frequencies will be sent to the Subwoofer (LFE and non-LFE) whether the speaker channels are set to \u201clarge\u201d or \u201csmall\u201d.\nFor details on LFE, read our companion article:WTF is LFE?\nIn addition to home theater and surround sound, subwoofers can also be used in a stereo system for music listening. When a subwoofer is added to a stereo setup, it is referred to as a 2.1-channel setup.\nThis can be done in two ways:\n1. Some stereo receivers have subwoofer outputs. This means you can connect a powered subwoofer to your system using a single audio cable.\n2. If you have a powered subwoofer that has standard speaker input/output terminals in addition to a subwoofer input, you can connect the left and right channel speaker outputs of your stereo receiver to the subwoofer and route the speaker output connections to your left and right channel speakers.\nThis creates a little more wire clutter, but the benefit is that you get an extra bass boost from the subwoofer, which comes in handy if you are using compact-size left and right-channel speakers.\nIn this type of setup, you would use the crossover controls on the subwoofer to determine the point where audio frequencies are reproduced by the subwoofer and which frequencies are sent further to the left and right channel speakers.\nMost soundbars come packaged with a subwoofer, which typically connects to the soundbar wirelessly via bluetooth or Wi-Fi. In this type of setup, the soundbar has a pre-determined crossover point that determines which frequencies are reproduced by the soundbar and which are assigned to the subwoofer.\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission.\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "content": "We\u2019re a little late on this, but figured it makes sense to share anyway in case anyone missed the news\u2026 Earlier this week, Audio-Technica dropped a limited-edition model of their fan favoriteSound Burger portable turntablewith modern updates including Bluetooth connectivity and USB-C charging for 12 hours of continuous playback. Originally launched in 1980, the Sound Burger was meant to be a competitor of the Sony Walkman, but has since reached cult status due to the rise in popularity of vinyl and its \u201cnear mythic\u201d sound quality.\nUnsurprisingly, the run of 7,000 sold out almost immediately and the turntables are already popping up onreseller sitesfor more than three times the original $199 MSRP. It\u2019s crazy to think that drop culture has even made its way to audio equipment and turntables, but here we are!\nThe hype does seem warranted though as the reviews have been overwhelmingly positive so far with fans praising the brand \u201cfor not pushing out a cheap mechanism dressed up with their branding and actually caring how it sounds.\u201d We also love that the promo materials are clearly intended for a younger generation of vinyl consumers. The \u201cvintage retro\u201d aesthetic is quite popular with Gen Z so the strategy seems completely on point.\nOf course, we still have to give props to the original Sound Burger promo designs that are just incredibly creative, fun, and unlike any other turntable advertisements we\u2019ve seen. Sound Island, Sound Coffee-Cup, Sound Crocodile\u2026 Just amazing!\nFrom Audio-Technica:\n\u201cThe limited-edition AT-SB2022 portable turntable is the return of the Sound Burger, a fan favorite since the 1980s thanks to its nostalgic design, quirky advertising campaigns, and unique listening experience, with\u00a0modern updates including Bluetooth\u00ae connectivity and a USB-C charging cable. Connect to your Bluetooth headphones or speakers and enjoy your favorite vinyl records wirelessly for up to 12 hours. This turntable features a lightweight design making it perfect for parties, picnics, or compact living spaces.\u201d\nWe hope the incredible response pushes Audio-Technica to do a mass non-limited release of the Sound Burger\u2026 We\u2019d love to have a quality new turntable for record fairs, storage unit digs, or even just casually playing a few records at the park with friends.

        "content": "Wharfedale\u2019s founder, Gilbert Briggs built his first loudspeaker in 1932 in his home in Ilkey, Yorkshire; the town was based in the valley of the river \u201cWharfe.\u201d Briggs opened Wharfedale Wireless Works in 1933 supplying advanced loudspeaker drivers to the growing radio industry and the company became a leading supplier selling more than 9,000 units per year until the outbreak of World War II. The company flourished after the war and became one of the first companies to offer a two-way loudspeaker in 1945 \u2013 the prototype for the modern loudspeaker. Briggs would be quite impressed with the Wharfedale Linton Heritage speakers more than 7 decades later.\nWharfedale introduced the original Linton in 1965 and the model which utilized three drive units developed a strong following with its smooth midrange, punchy low end, and sense of scale. The model disappeared from their line-up in the 1970s but was recently reintroduced as the stand-mounted Linton Heritage. Wharfedale has also designed a custom stand for the Linton Heritage that puts the tweeter around 36\u201d from the floor and includes room for records as well.\nThe three-way loudspeakers are larger than mostbookshelf loudspeakersmaking the stands a logical accessory to maximize their performance. The modern Linton feature an 8-inch Kevlar cone woofer, 5-inch Kevlar cone midrange driver, and 1-inch soft dome tweeter. Listeners may decide to ditch the woven grille covers, but we think they give the Linton that old-school look that makes them stand out.\nWharfedale designed the Linton with two rear ports which requires giving these loudspeakers some distance from the wall behind them; the 8-inch woofer can deliver the goods with only 20 watts so don\u2019t confuse old with polite. The Linton Heritage offer all of the midrange resolution and natural sound of the original, but with a lot more detail, speed, and transparency.\nThey deliver scale and image rather well considering their boxy looking cabinet. If your budget can stretch to $1,800 which includes the stands, the Linton should be on your short list.\nWhat we like the most about the Wharfedale Linton Heritage speakers is that you don\u2019t need to spend a fortune on electronics to really enjoy them and they look great; some people are unhappy that they are manufactured in China but there is no way Wharfedale could manufacture these in the United Kingdom with this level of quality at that price. No way.\nI know that everyone can\u2019t pull these 2 to 3 feet out into the room, but it makes a big difference if you can. It also helps if you can angle them towards your listening position as opposed to pointing them directly ahead.\nHaving lived with a pair of Spendor SP2/3s for almost 8 years, I am painfully aware that speakers like the Linton Heritage (which remind me so much of the Spendor Classic lineup) can produce a \u201cwall of sound\u201d and not image very well if you don\u2019t angle them at your listening position.\nThe positioning can have a huge impact on the bass response and while you might lose some of the midrange warmth with the drivers pointed directly at your head, the precision of the imaging will improve and you are likely to hear more detail in your recordings.\nThe stands should also be considered a mandatory accessory.\nThe Linton Heritage can work well with a lot of different amplifiers; Audiolab, Rotel, Cambridge Audio, Naim, Croft Acoustics, Creek, and vintage amplifiers from Marantz, Audio Research, and Sansui are all solid options.\nIf you follow Wharfedale on Instagram, you\u2019ll notice that Linton Heritage owners use a wide range of electronics with them. I\u2019ve seen everything from McIntosh integrated amplifiers, Naim Supernait 3 amplifiers,Aragon4004 MKIIpower amplifiers, and a lot ofAudiolab 6000A integrated amplifiersas well.\nI\u2019m not sure that I would use really warm sounding amplifiers with the Linton Heritage only because it will be too much of a good thing and my listening experience with them suggests that they could become rather boring over the long haul.\nI do think they sound better with 45 watts or more and they will not self-destruct with 200 watts/channel either.\nDepending on your budget, theRotel A14MKII Integrated Amplifier,Croft Phono Integrated, andNaim NAIT 5siwill all work really well with the Linton Heritage speakers.\nThe Rotel A14MkII is an updated version of Rotel\u2019s best-selling A14 integrated amplifier that has a lot of power under the hood. The chassis doesn\u2019t give way just how much grunt there is under the ventilated top cover but it\u2019s there.\u00a0It delivers 80 watts/channel with a decent MM phono stage.\nThe Croft Phono Integrated only delivers 45 watts/channel but it sounds far more powerful and has a phenomenal MM phono stage in a no-frills chassis that looks dated as hell. Croft has never spent any money on a fancy box but it sounds sublime with Wharfedale loudspeakers. I\u2019ve used Croft & Wharfedale together for many years and it\u2019s definitely going to be one of my systems when I retire.\nThe Naim NAIT 5si does not include a phono stage but it has so much pace and energy, that it\u2019s hard to not love it with the Wharfedale speakers. I\u2019ve heard expensive Naim separates with the Wharfedale Linton Heritage speakers and just loved the combination.\nTheRega Planar 3($1,125) with theNagaoka MP-110 cartridge($154) will really shine with the Rotel or Croft amplifiers.\nWharfedale Linton Heritage Loudspeakers($1,799/pairwith the matching stands)\nFinishes:\u00a0Walnut or Red Mahogany\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission.\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "content": "Over the past 23 years, I have had the opportunity to listen to more products than I can possibly remember; the truly superb ones that left such an impression that I contemplated selling an organ or getting a third job \u2014 I would say that number is under 20. TheDecware SuperZen Triodemakes that list without too much effort.\nNone of them were weird looking or so outlandish that I lay in bed at night sweating next to my spouse knowing that she would divorce me (again) if I made the decision to acquire one. Nothing looks sexier than a restored pair ofQuad ESLs orMartinLogan CLZ IIzin a post-modern living room. Having owned a Wavelength Audio Duetto, Fi X, and Emotive Audio Sira, it is fair to say that I am someone who enjoys a good light show.\nI have just never had a lot of luck with tube gear that has proven very reliable; the truth is that the tubes were almost always the culprit and that includes some Western Electric 300Bs that detonated for no apparent reason and I balked at spending over $800 (more than 20 years ago) to replace them. Cheap Russian 300B replacements lasted two years before I sold the amplifier.\nTheUnison Research Triode 25 Integrated Amplifiercurrently under review sounds absolutely stellar and I\u2019m rather smitten. One of the tubes already put on a strange glow and the crackle through my Q Acoustics 3050i proved to be nothing.\nMaybe.\nReliability is huge and that\u2019s what you get when you buy fromDecware.\nWhen you order a SuperZen Triode amplifier you get durability, tubes that don\u2019t get driven so hard that they die within months, and superb sound quality.\nTheDecware SuperZen Triodeis a handmade 2.3 watts/channel tube amplifier that hits much harder than its power rating would suggest in a smaller room or home office. There are two pairs of RCA inputs, and it is available with several different bases for additional cost.\nIt\u2019s built incredibly well by a company that has such a cult following that the waiting list is getting longer and longer with each passing day.\nJust how long? Possibly 8 months before your order gets built. Or even longer after taking a recent look at the waiting list.\nThe amplifier has a rather non-conventional look (12\u201dD x 6\u201dW x 8\u201dH) and absolutely becomes the focal point of any system; both aesthetically and sonically.\nIt\u2019s rare to find their products on the \u201cused\u201d market and they don\u2019t last more than a day when one pops up. $1,395 for this 18-pound amplifier that has a lifetime warranty and delivers rather remarkable performance at this price.\nMade in America to very high standards and I\u2019ve never heard a single Decware amplifier that didn\u2019t sound great with high sensitivity loudspeakers.\nThey also stand by their products, offer excellent customer service, and their amplifiers don\u2019t use super expensive exotic tubes that cost a fortune to replace.\nThe Decware SuperZen Triode Model SE84UFO2\u00a0is shipped with\u00a0premium quality\u00a0NOS 6P15P-EV output tubes with gold grids rated at over 5000 hours. These Russian military spec tubes are the top grade of what we came to know in this country for a brief spell as the SV83. You can also use EL84 tubes in this amp.\nWhat makes the Decware SuperZen Triode such a good amplifier is that it gets the basics right; quality circuit design, good iron, affordable tubes, and excellent reliability.\nFor a tube amplifier, it doesn\u2019t commit the usual sins of rolling off the top end or sounding slightly soft in the bottom. Pair it with the right pair of loudspeakers and it can create a huge soundstage and layers of beautiful music in your space.\nOmega Speaker Systemshave a very loyal following because they offer bespoke high-sensitivity loudspeakers that offer tremendous performance and craftsmanship. Louis Chochos is a detail-oriented designer and builder who offers excellent customer service and is willing to work with each customer to make sure they get the \u201cright\u201d loudspeaker for their specific situation. He builds beautiful looking cabinets that are designed to last.\nTheCAM(Compact Alnico Monitor) don\u2019t have the slam of the now discontinued Zu Audio Cubes, but they are overflowing with texture and definitely more laid back sounding which might be preferable in a nearfield listening situation. They are \u201ccompact\u201d in comparison to other Omega models, but they are certainly not small loudspeakers (16\u201dH x 12\u201dW x 8.5\u201dD) that will vanish on your desktop.\nThey can be ordered with the bass port on the rear/front of the cabinet depending on your set-up location. They work really well in a bookcase with the port on the front of the cabinet. The 94.5 dB (8 ohms) sensitivity rating makes them ideal for the Decware amplifier.\nNot everyone wants to spend another $1,495 on a pair of loudspeakers after buying the SuperZen Triode, and most of the single-driver loudspeakers tend to be on the larger side which makes the desktop system scenario almost impossible.\n2.5 watts is not a lot of power and that does limit your options \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean that there are none.\nWharfedale has replaced my beloved Diamond 10.1s which I still use in my office with the new Diamond 12 models and we are huge fans of the Diamond 12.1 bookshelf loudspeakers and have covered them extensively; you can read our system building suggestionshereand read my detailedreviewas well.\nThe Diamond 10.1s certainly worked with the SuperZen Triode on the desktop as long as you\u2019re not looking for anything more than conversation level volume and I suspect that the newer 12.1s will work as well.\nYou could also add a REL T Zero MKIII Subwoofer to this system which would allow you to drive the loudspeakers above 100Hz with the Decware and we suspect that might work ever better and it would still be $500 less than the Omega CAMs.\nThere are a wide range of DACs and streamers that work well including theAudioQuest DragonFly Cobalt(which you can use separately as your headphone amplifier),Andover Audio Songbird/Schiit Audio Modi 3 Multibit DACcombination, orCambridge Audio CXN V2 streamer/DAC.\nAnother excellent network streamer that keeps the cost down is the brand newBluesound NODEwhich keeps things really simple as it already has an internal DAC. $599 and access to all of the major streaming platforms.\nThe Decware almost screams out for a good vintage turntable and we\u2019re huge fans of therestored Thorens turntables by Vinyl Nirvanawhich is based in New Hampshire.\nSelect either theCroft AcousticsorMoon by SimAudiophono stage fromour list of favorite audiophile phono preampsand you have a very high-end system for under $7,000.\nIf you require a CD player because you don\u2019t do the streaming thing or gave up on vinyl playback, theMarantz CD60is a really good option for the SuperZen Triode.\nFor more information:Decware SuperZen Triode Amplifier\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission.\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "title": "Vinyl Nirvana & The Art of Vintage Turntable Restoration",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/vinyl-nirvana/",
        "content": "Have you taken a look at turntable prices lately? Inflation is having a significant impact on the prices of high-end audio components and it is not not unusual to see 20 to 30% increases with some brands. Very few brands can absorb the rising costs due to supply chain issues and not have to charge more. Mass produced tables from brands like Fluance, Pro-Ject, Audio-Technica, and Rega are still not out of reach for audiophiles but does it now make sense to start looking at vintage turntable restorations that offer better long-term value?Vinyl Nirvananeeds to be on your radar if that is the case.\nDave Archambault is a busy man. The proprietor of New Hampshire-based Vinyl Nirvana has been restoring and rebuilding vintage Thorens and Acoustic Research turntables full-time for almost a decade and 2020/2021 proved to be very challenging years; a period that he was able to navigate through a lot of hard work, creativity, and a major pivot when events beyond his control both at home here in America and in Asia almost upset the golden applecart.\nHe has becomethesource for affordable restorations and reproductions that are second to none, but Vinyl Nirvana is not a large turntable manufacturer like Pro-Ject, Rega, or VPI who have the ability to engineer and manufacture their own tonearms.\n2021 was a record year for vinyl sales across the globe with tens of millions of people stuck at home because of pandemic lockdown rules. Americans spent over $1 billion on40 million new records in the United States alone. That\u2019s the most new albums shipped in the U.S. in 33 years (since 1988).\nTheRIAA H1 2022 music industry reportjust released made a lot of people in the vinyl and turntable categories rather happy; vinyl sales rose 22% in the United States during the first 6 months of the year and while that\u2019s a far cry from the 97% increase during the same period in 2021 \u2014 there were a number of mitigating factors that created such a dramatic increase.\nPandemic, shuttered record stores, brisk online sales, travel restrictions, and no live music.\nInflation is certainly not helping any industry right now (unless you\u2019re buying a new or used car), and consumers were unlikely to increase spending on non-essential items such as records when the average family is spending $400 to $500 more each month on gasoline, food, and clothing.\nA 22% increase still suggests that there is strong interest in new vinyl sales.\nThat massive surge in demand also put a lot of pressure onturntable and tonearm manufacturers; which was exacerbated by supply chain issues across the globe.\nJapanese tonearm manufacturer, Jelco, a major supplier of OEM tonearms for a number of manufacturers, restoration companies, and the DIY community called it quits creating a massive shortage of tonearms.\nAdding to the shortage was the inane decision by British manufacturer, SME, to stop selling its renown high-end tonearms to anyone. If you want one of their tonearms, you have to buy one of their very expensive turntables. Greed isn\u2019t always good.\nSo what does a bespoke restoration company do when two of its primary tonearm suppliers decide to make life difficult for everyone?\nIt pivots to something even better manufactured in Japan that will be available on all of the Vinyl Nirvana models based around the Thorens TD-160 Super and TD-125 turntables.\nI\u2019ve seen it. I\u2019m not allowed to share. It will be installed on my new Thorens TD-125 MK II restoration which I hope to have in Q4. I just need to get in line like everybody else.\nI\u2019ve been a customer of Vinyl Nirvana for over 5 years; 2 restored Thorens turntables are my reference decks at home, and I endorse Vinyl Nirvana as someone who paid full price for his turntables and has benefitted enormously from their set-up and performance advice.\nCustomer service is a huge reason why people patronize smaller companies, and this is one company that gets that part right. Much better than other brands in the audiophile space.\nSo if 2020 was a much harder year for companies like Vinyl Nirvana to get enough tonearms to keep up with the demand for finished tables, how did they deal with the shortfall?\nRestorations and parts sales.\nEven with his tonearm issue resolved, Archambault did the smartest thing possible. He focused on consulting services and restorations of older Thorens and Acoustic Research turntables that people were buying in huge numbers on eBay or discovering in the basement or attic.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been busy. Very busy,\u201d remarked Archambault when we spoke on the phone last week.\n\u201cOver the past 20 years since I started the company, I\u2019ve accumulated the largest stash of new/used Thorens parts in the world, which makes what we do invaluable. A big part of my business is helping the customer who discovers a 35-year-old TD-125 in their parent\u2019s attic which needs to be serviced but they don\u2019t know where to turn. Not only do I have the parts, but I can make it sound better than it ever did,\u201d said Archambault.\n\u201cTheThorens TD-125, in particular, is my favorite turntable to work on. I cringe a little when I see other restoration companies build brand new plinths that completely swallow up the front of the table. That design feature is so iconic, and I make sure that our custom wood plinths only accentuate the beauty of it,\u201d explained Archambault.\n\u201cWhat made the TD-125 so unique was the electronic speed control that was a major feature of the turntable. The pitch control was a very important feature that high-end buyers demanded and Thorens made it work.\u201d\n\u201cThorens sold more than 100,000 TD-125s in 1975 alone if the numbers are accurate, and that means that there are a lot of tables and parts floating around. I was smart when I started and bought up as much of the supply of parts that I could find,\u201d Archambault explained.\nThe TD-125 was originally sold with its own tonearm, but users began switching them out for SME tonearms for their superior performance. With SME out of the DIY game, Archambault is confident that his new tonearm will be popular with his customers; which include some heavy-hitters from the music world, actors, comedians, and regular music lovers looking for a durable and custom turntable.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, the TD-125 is a very easy turntable to service. I\u2019ve worked on so many of them at this point, that I feel like it\u2019s a part of me. Thorens knew what they were doing when they built this deck. It\u2019s a heavy suspended design with a 7-pound platter and they are made to last.\u201d\nSo why buy a used Thorens and have It restored to its original glory? Why not buy something new?\nSwiss-made (or German-made depending on the decade) Thorens turntables have been prized by audiophiles for both their sound quality and precision engineering since 1957 with the launch of the TD-124 idler drive turntable, and that list has grown over the years to include the TD-145, TD-150, TD-160/Super, and TD-125 belt-driven models.\nThorens relocated their manufacturing to Germany, Poland, and Switzerland during some rather tumultuous decades for the company as it struggled to combat the birth of digital audio, and only recently in 2018 was restructured with new ownership that is based in Germany. Thorens is back in the game of manufacturing brand new high-end turntables but has shown little interest in supporting legacy products that were some of the best belt-driven turntables ever made.\nThe brand is back in force with a new lineup of turntables, including a replacement for the TD-160, but the real demand for its turntables remains focused on the designs of the past.\n\u201cAll of the Thorens tables have this remarkable quality about them. Precision instruments with enormous modification potential and a very smooth sound that will never go out of style. I can\u2019t imagine why anyone would want something made overseas that doesn\u2019t have the build quality to last a generation. These tables have survived decades of use and still sound better than a lot of new tables sold today. I\u2019m proud to offer them,\u201d explained Archambault.\nVinyl Nirvana offers complete packages which include exotic hardwood plinths, a choice of tonearms, and cartridge options from Grado Labs, Ortofon, and Dynavector. Information about their restoration services and consultation process is available on their website.\nFor more information:vinylnirvana.com\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission.\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/quad-303-33/",
        "content": "As much as I want to say that all of the great vintage audio came out of New York in the 1960s, that\u2019s certainly not the case. We\u2019re going to take a trip across the pond this week to discuss one of the most important British audio brands that is still going strong as part of theInternational Audio Group(Wharfedale, Audiolab, Mission, Castle Acoustics) and whose vintage audio products are heavily sought after by audiophiles.\nThe Quad ESLs established the brand as a major player in the world of high-end audio in 1957, but we\u2019re not going to focus on Peter Walker\u2019s revolutionary electrostatic loudspeakers right now \u2013 our focus is going to be on the Quad 303 power amplifier and 303 Control Unit.\nStarted after WWII and under the direction of Peter Walker, Quad introduced their first amplifier, theQuad 1, and subsequently in 1953, theQuad 2.\nBoth were tube amplifiers and are quite collectible now if you can find a set. Everything changed for the company in 1957 with the introduction of the Quad ESL loudspeakers. The ESL, contrary to any other stories, was not their first loudspeaker. It was their first commercial success in the category.\nThe original ESL, in production between 1957 and 1985, has been hailed in almost every audio publication in the world as one of the most important speakers of the 20th century. It was succeeded in 1981 by the ESL-63, which remained in production until 1999.\nFor all of its remarkable transparency, the Quad ESL was a very difficult loudspeaker to drive. If you\u2019ve never heard a pair in great working condition, it\u2019s an experience worth having. Especially when you realize that the technology is from almost 60 years ago. The listening sweet spot is also remarkably small; basically, one person.\nVintage audio fans will spend a lot of money for a restored pair; and as I\u2019ve discovered recently the same group of people have a lot of respect for the Quad 303 and 33.\nQuad introduced their first transistor amplifier unit in 1967 and that is where the Quad 303 and 33 enter the picture. Quad did not have a wide catalog of products unlike many of their competitors, and purposely built their products to have a long life cycle.\nThe first thing you notice about all of the Quad solid-state equipment is that it looked nothing like any of the other equipment of the period; and nothing like anything that has come since. None of the U.S. or Japanese manufacturers created anything that looked or sounded like the Quad products of the period.\nThe tuner, preamp, and amplifier were all separate units; you could hide the amplifier away from view leaving just the 10 \u00bc\u201d wide and 6\u201d deep preamplifier and tuner visible.\nThe Quad 303 used rather interesting heatsinks to dissipate heat and while it benefits from ventilation, Quad knew that users would place it inside a console or cabinet.\nCompared to the 20-24\u201d wide models being created in Japan and the United States, the Quad 33 mini stack could fit just about anywhere. The Quad cases are grey metal with plastic orange and white buttons in contrast to the normal metal faceplates of the time that were common with Fisher, Marantz, and McIntosh.\nAudio reviewers were unduly harsh in their criticism of the color scheme, but consumers had a very different opinion about it. I find Quad\u2019s choice of grey metal combined with the orange tuner dial, and white buttons to be strikingly more interesting than anything else being offered at the time from most of the manufacturers. McIntosh and Marantz had a very distinct look that is still prized today and the consensus online among collectors is that Quad hit one out of the park.\nThe Quad 33 Control Unit features a Radio 1, Radio 2 (AUX), Disc (phono everywhere else on the planet), and 2 Tape inputs (one for record/play and one for playback only). The first thing anyone will notice is the use of DIN inputs. Naim Audio have used DIN plugs for decades and there are anumber of companiesmaking 3rdparty RCA to DIN cables/plugs that you can use to connect the 303 to the 33 and sources.\nNot the end of the world as they can still be found but if you have a chance to buy one of these units ensure cabling is part of the deal; especially the Quad power cords as they are unlike anything I have seen in other units. Speakers are easily connected with banana plugs.\nThe Control Unit and Tuner weigh 6.5 pounds while the amplifier comes in at 18 pounds.\nAside from the volume dial, you can adjust the sound with bass, treble and slope dials as well as 5k, 7k, and 10k button filters. These are for removing record surface noise and high frequency distortion when used in concert with the slope dial. Quad provides diagrams for this in their instruction booklet, but I found it just as easy, and enjoyable to try the variety of options to dial in the sound I like.\nThe Cancel button allows you to hear the music without alteration and having to adjust any of your preferences. A modern version of a bypass switch.\nThe Quad 303 is rated at a very respectable 45 watts per channel into 8 ohms making this very easy to pair with speakers of the time. When I cracked open the case, I appreciated the forward thinking layout which was designed for easy servicing; something that is not the case with a lot of the receivers from the 1970s.\nQuad wanted these components to last and if parts had to be replaced, the goal was to make it easy for a qualified technician or owner to do so.\nI\u2019ve seen restorers of these products change the DIN connections to RCA input jacks and that\u2019s certainly an option if you have technical ability to do it.\nThe Quad 303 and 33 definitely have a sound; and I\u2019ve noticed from other users online that a lot of people like them with the BBC LS3/5a models (15 ohm version produced by Rogers is a very good choice), Quad ESLs, Tannoy, Wharfedale Diamond Series, and older KEF and Spendor loudspeakers.\nI would not blast music through the Quad 303. It was designed to work with high impedance loudspeakers (8 ohm or higher) at conversation levels.\nIn terms of my own vintage loudspeakers, I found the experience rather interesting.\nI used the Quad 303 and 33 in my main system with the Ohm F\u2019s on a Niles A/B switcher with the other system being a McIntosh C28 with an SAE 2500 amplifier.\nWith some adjustments of the filters, tone, slope, and volume, \u2014 it was actually hard to tell the two systems apart. It was really that good. The Quad combination is definitely \u201cwell mannered\u201d and certainly not a forward sounding combination with propulsive bass response. You need to adjust the tone and filters to create a more \u201cmodern\u201d sound.\nOne area where the Quad 303 and 33 truly shine is when you adjust the sound to conversation levels with better recordings. The warm tonal balance is almost impossible to ignore but the detail retrieval was surprisingly quite good.\nSome might find the overall presentation slightly too relaxed, but I think it really depends on your choice of loudspeaker and I was quite amazed at how much I enjoyed music through this combination. It\u2019s definitely a pairing I want to own at some point.\nNot everyone has a pair ofOhm F\u2019savailable, so I also used the Quad 303 and 33 with my Dynaco a25\u2019s,Advent Large, and my new EPI M100\u2019s. The 303 drove them all quite effortlessly, highlighting the bass response of the Advents, and the overall balance of the Dynaco loudspeakers.\nThe Quad 303 and 33 threw me for a loop. I didn\u2019t know what to expect and they were a wonderful combination that made a lot of modern music (especially poorly recorded albums) sound a lot better. They are popular with collectors so prepare to pay a decent amount for a set in very good condition.\nThere are people who specialize in their restoration but that comes with a serious price tag. Quad hit one out of the park with the 303/33 combination and I think music lovers in the U.K. were very lucky to get their hands on them first.\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission."

Co-founded by Charlie Ballinger, Max Dowaliby, Dan Wissinger, and designer Danny Taylor, owner of New York audio consultancy House Under Magic, the quaint 1000 sq. ft. space features 36 carefully placed seats, a finely tuned sound system with a diffusion wall and acoustic panels, and a menu of craft cocktails, natural wines, and small plates.\nA few friends of In Sheep\u2019s Clothing are regular selectors at Eavesdrop and introduced us to co-founder Dan Wissinger. Below, we asked Dan a few questions over email to learn more about the concept and intention behind this unique space.\nWhat was your inspiration for opening Eavesdrop? Obviously it\u2019s quite different from other music venues in New York and also different even from Public Records, the other hi-fi minded spot in the city.\nOf course, we were inspired by what we\u2019ve heard of jazz kissa / listening bar culture in Tokyo and around the world, but I\u2019d say what we really tried to recreate with Eavesdrop was the feeling of friends hanging out at home playing records for each other.\nNew York has so many great places for music, but most of them are dance-floor-oriented.\u00a0We love clubs, but we always felt like our favorite part of the night was the pre-party: having friends over for dinner and drinks, usually to whoever\u2019s apartment has the best sound system. Bring your records, bring your USB, everyone take turns on the decks. Those were really the nights that inspired us to create Eavesdrop.\nThe small, intimate space reminds us of a lot of jazz kissas in Japan. Did any specific spots in Japan inspire the design of Eavesdrop?\nThe honest truth is\u2026 we haven\u2019t been.\u00a0 While we were very inspired by what we\u2019d heard about jazz kissas and that whole tradition, we never made the trek before the pandemic.\u00a0And when we really got serious about building Eavesdrop, travel restrictions prevented us from being able to see those places.\u00a0We absolutely would have if we could, but I think in a way it turned out to be a blessing.\u00a0Rather than trying to recreate a concept from someone else\u2019s culture, we tried to take inspiration from it while building something that we felt would work in our community.\u00a0We were careful to nod to jazz kissas in various ways.\u00a0I\u2019d point out the food in particular: Max (Partner, Head of Food and Beverage) is half Japanese, and it shows in his food. But at the same time, we were careful not to try toimitateJapanese places \u2013 we just didn\u2019t feel we had the credentials to do that.\nThe traditional non-speaking type of listening bar is obviously something difficult to achieve in New York and the United States in general. How does Eavesdrop approach the listening bar concept, and how has it played out with visitors?\nIn a lot of ways this is the million dollar question for our concept, and it matters a lot to the DJs, the music heads, and the audiophile community. Rather than trying to enforce a strict no-talking rule, we try to cater an experience that limits noise naturally.\u00a0Guests are encouraged to make reservations, and we don\u2019t allow big groups.\u00a0Booths and tables are cozy and intimate \u2013 you\u2019re never more than whispering distance from the folks in your party. We investedheavilyin acoustic treatment: there is diffusio`n, but an extra emphasis on absorption.\u00a0All this leads to an environment where one never needs to shout to be heard.\u00a0The DJ is right in the room with you \u2013 there\u2019s no \u201cbooth\u201d area, and when the set starts we change the lighting, which usually creates a bit of a hush and a shift of attention.\nIt\u2019s not perfect, and we do occasionally ask loud guests to please quiet down, but we\u2019re trying to get the vibe to feel like that living room experience rather than a hi-fi temple. I think this strikes a nice balance that works for all our guests, from the audiophiles to the neighborhood happy hour crowd, the folks deep in the music scene as well as the \u201clistening-bar-curious\u201d, if you will.\nIt looks like there\u2019s an array of custom speakers and equipment that make up the gorgeous soundsystem at Eavesdrop. What can you say about the soundsystem (builders, parts, brands, etc.)?\nThe entire room, from the sound system to the acoustic treatment to the millwork and furniture, was designed by Danny Taylor of House Under Magic.\u00a0I think it\u2019s really important to start that way, by saying that the whole thing was designed cohesively, rather than having one person do the sound system, another do the treatment, and a third do the interior design.\u00a0 I think that\u2019s really the magic of what makes Eavesdrop work, and for the most part we like for people to just get immersed in it rather than thinking about technical specs, equipment, materials, and such.\u00a0 That said, it\u2019s always fun to talk a little tech!\nThe mains are two Danley SH60s which Danny took apart, customized a bit, and then painted.\u00a0Hidden below are two Seaton Submersive S2 subs.\u00a0The Danleys have seven drivers and each S2 has a pair of 15s.\u00a0They\u2019re powered by Bryston 7B SSTs, the kind of thing you\u2019d typically find in a recording studio.\u00a0The Mastersounds Radius 4v mixer adds some nice character.\u00a0It\u2019s all carefully tuned by Danny, and most importantly it faces a custom-built diffusion wall.\u00a0We built a soffit over a booth in the back corner to house a bass trap, and there\u2019s treatment all over the ceiling. The Danleys are very directional, so every seat in the room sounds a little different, but they all sound good.\nA few of our close friends are resident selectors at Eavesdrop. Is there a theme or direction with the music played in this space? Can you highlight a few of the other selectors who have residencies?\nOur goal with the booking is to pull from all the various scenes and sub-genres that New York has to offer, but to hear how that scene treats a listening environment like Eavesdrop.\u00a0 We want to hear all different genres, but what\u2019s played should of course be selected to suit the environment.\u00a0 You can hear anything from jazz to techno at Eavesdrop \u2013 you just won\u2019t hear DJs play the same records they\u2019d play in the club at three in the morning in a club.\u00a0Everyone does such a nice job it\u2019s hard to name anyone in particular.\nWhat are some albums/tracks that have really worked in the space and capture the vibe of Eavesdrop?\nThis one is really a matter of personal taste, but I tend to really love late \u201990s era downtempo and trip-hop.\u00a0Things that are well-produced, bassy but not outrageously so, mostly electronic but in a way that\u2019s more lush and atmospheric rather than angular or robotic.\u00a0Ulrich Schnauss\u2019sFar Away Trains Passing Byis maybe my all time favorite record for our room and it fits that profile very well.\nI\u2019ve read that you also do more industry related events during the week with labels, artists, and record stores. Any recent highlights you\u2019d like to share?\nFor Monday and Tuesday nights, when there\u2019s no DJ, we had two of our favorite record stores put together a selection of LPs that the bartender will play from a turntable by the bar.The Mixtape Shophas Monday\u2019s andBrooklyn Record Exchangeis on Tuesday.\u00a0Brian and Ben each did a fantastic job and I really encourage people to come check out those nights.\nWe\u2019ve got a listening event coming up September 15th for Au Suisse\u2019s self titled album on City Slang records.\u00a0Eavesdrop is such a nice environment for a record release, so we\u2019re trying to do more of those.\u00a0We have a few in the works, but nothing I can announce just yet!\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "title": "Understanding Speaker Frequency Response",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/understanding-speaker-frequency-response/",
        "content": "Here\u2019s an essential archival article from Paul Diacomo, a brilliant writer and longtime Polk Audio executive who published many classic articles on hi-fi throughout the years. We are publishing it again here in the hope that a new generation of readers finds great value in his writing.\nHere\u2019s a quick quiz: which of these two speakers sounds better: Speaker A with a frequency response range of 45Hz to 18kHz or, Speaker B with a range of 20Hz to 25kHz? The truth is there\u2019s simply not enough data in these numbers to know anything of value. Taken out of context and without other data, a simple set of numbers don\u2019t tell you much about real world sound quality. But people make audio buying decisions based on published specifications, such as the frequency response spec, everyday. I\u2019d like to demystify the process for you; let you in on a little industry secret about \u201cThe Frequency Response Spec.\u201d\nThe Frequency Response specification attempts to describe the range of frequencies or musical tones a speaker can reproduce, measured in Hertz (known to old-timers as \u201cCycles per Second\u201d). The range of human hearing is generally regarded as being from 20Hz, very low bass tones, through 20kHz (20,000Hz), the very highest treble. Presumably a speaker that could reproduce that range would sound lifelike. Alas, it is no guarantee. The most important determinant of a speaker\u2019s frequency performance is not its width or range, but whether it\u2019s capable of reproducing all the audible frequencies at the same volume at which they were recorded.\nYou don\u2019t want the speaker to change the \u201cmix\u201d of tones; that would ruin the timbre of voices and instruments, making them sound unnatural. Ideally, you want the sounds that are on the recording to be reproduced as they were recorded, without the speaker changing the sound. To say it another way: if you made a recording of all the audible tones at the same volume and played that recording through a speaker, you\u2019d want all the audible tones to come out at the same volume. In fact, that\u2019s one way of measuring speakers. A signal that\u2019s comprised of all frequencies at equal volume is fed into a speaker that sits in a room with no reflective surfaces. A calibrated microphone is placed in front of the speaker and feeds the speaker\u2019s output into a machine that plots the frequency vs. amplitude as shown in Figure A.\nNow take a look at the graph in Figure B. That\u2019s the frequency response of the Erehwon Model 10, with drivers and tweeters made of pure Unobtainium (\u201cHalf the carbs, all the sound!\u201d). The flat line on the graph indicates that the speaker is \u201cflat\u201d; it reproduces all the musically relevant tones at the same volume. That doesn\u2019t mean that a \u201cflat\u201d speaker will play all recorded sounds at the same volume \u2014 bear with me here \u2014 it means that it will treat all sounds equally; it won\u2019t impose its will on the music but will allow you to hear the music as it was recorded. Flat is good. Flat response means that the speaker reproduces sound accurately.\nA big improvement would be a frequency response number that also includes the amplitude tolerance, expressed as \u201cXHz-YkHz +/- 3dB.\u201d This tells you that the amplitude of the speaker\u2019s response relative to frequency does not deviate more than 3 Decibels from the center line. The \u201cplus or minus 3dB\u201d spec is regarded as a standard of sorts. The theory is that 3dB differences are \u201cjust perceptible,\u201d so a speaker whose response curve lies within that tolerance window is a reasonably accurate speaker. Let\u2019s see if that idea holds water.\nIf I had to choose strictly by the response curves, I\u2019d choose speaker D because its amplitude variations are smoother and gentler. In contrast, speaker C\u2019s amplitude variations are more extreme and \u201cspikey.\u201d Experience has shown speaker designers that those rapid changes in response produce a sound that is more fatiguing, less pleasing and subjectively less accurate.\nNow that you know the importance (and limitations) of amplitude variations in frequency response graphs, you might ask: \u201cdoes the frequency range tell us anything at all?\u201d Yes, it does. As long as you know the amplitude tolerance (+/- 3dB), the frequency response range or width tells you how high or low the speaker goes. A speaker rated as 20Hz \u2013 25kHz +/- 3dB will play lower bass and higher treble sounds than a speaker that measures 40Hz \u2013 20kHz +/- 3dB. I wouldn\u2019t bet money that it would be the better, more enjoyable speaker, but at least I\u2019d know something of value.\nAnd now that you know how to interpret these numbers, you\u2019re ready to run right out and buy a speaker just by looking at the response curve, right? I wouldn\u2019t recommend it. Despite many advances in technology over the past 20 years,frequency response measurement is an imperfect science. The same speaker measured by two different labs may yield different response graphs. And some companies just plain cheat when they publish response curves. If it looks hand drawn, it probably was.(Yes, the graphs were hand drawn for illustration purposes.)\nThe Third DimensionSo far we\u2019ve talked about frequency (the X axis of the graph) and amplitude (Y axis) but we left out an important third dimension: time. When a speaker responds to an impulse, for example a rim shot \u2014 \u201cTHWACK!\u201d \u2014 it should start instantly and stop the instant the instrument stops making sound. If the speaker keeps vibrating or resonating and making sound after the source sound stops it\u2019s changing, or \u201ccoloring,\u201d the sound of the original recording. And that\u2019s bad.\nFigure F shows a bandwidth limited impulse signal. You can see that it starts and stops abruptly. Figure G shows that same impulse coming out of a speaker. You can see that the sound persists after the impulse input has stopped \u2014 it resonates or \u201crings.\u201d The speaker is changing the timbre or character of the original recording. In order to see to what extent and at which frequencies the \u201cringing\u201d is happening, we use a sophisticated computer algorithm called MLLSA (affectionately called \u201cMelissa\u201d by engineers who don\u2019t date much) to measure the response of a speaker in frequency, amplitude and time. Figure H is a MLLSA spectral decay graph of a prototype speaker. The third axis of this graph is time, so graph lines closest to you are measurements taken later than the ones in the back. Think of it as a series of slices with each slice being a frequency response graph taken at a different point in time.\nIf we were to measure the perfect speaker the MLLSA graph would look like a straight line in back with no lines in front. Real speakers fall far short of this ideal and continue to resonate after an impulse has stopped, such as in Figure H. Figure I is a Polk LSi9, and we can see that the speaker stops responding sooner in the midrange than the speaker pictured in Figure H, indicating that the LSi9 is a better sounding speaker.\nWhile no measurement technique can fully describe the subjective sound of a loudspeaker, MLLSA and other frequency response measurements are of great help to Polk engineers in developing better sounding speakers. Only a fool would design a speaker based on measurements alone and only a total fool would design a speaker based solely on subjective listening. A speaker that might sound good on a particular recording may in fact be flawed \u2013 it may have what is commonly called a \u201ceuphonic coloration.\u201d It may be pleasing to the ear under certain conditions, but it sure ain\u2019t right.\nWe use both measurements and subjective listening to design and evaluate speakers. The measurements save us time and are a great help in pointing us in the right design direction, avoiding mistakes that may come back to bite us later. The measurements give us a means of selecting which experimental designs are worth listening to.\nBut we have to be satisfied with the total subjective experience before a new design becomes aPolk Audio speaker. We spend countless hours listening to music and movies. Several experienced listeners have to listen to a proposed design and sign off on the sound before a model can even go into production. The Project Manager, Systems Engineer, VP of Engineering, Product Line Manager, and especially Matthew Polk, all have to agree that the prototype delivers the kind of rewarding listening experience that you expect from Polk Audio.\nYou now know the secret: a frequency response specification is a very weak predictor of the actual performance of a loudspeaker.A frequency response chart can be more helpful, but it\u2019s missing the important time measurement. You now know to look for overall curve smoothness and to avoid rapid swings in amplitude. Some magazines and review sites publish MLSSA graphs of reviewed speakers, and now you\u2019ll understand how to interpret them. More power to you!\nNo matter how adept you might be at interpreting frequency response data, it should only be one data point among many in choosing a speaker. There is so much more to a speaker\u2019s performance than just its response \u2013 like its dispersion and imaging, dynamic range and detail resolution as well as size, cosmetics and price. Looking at good frequency response data can help you eliminate speakers with obvious and obnoxious errors. Once you\u2019ve eliminated the boom & tizz pseudo-fi speakers, you can settle down to careful listening and making a more informed choice.\nPolk Audio publishes two frequency response specifications: \u201cOverall\u201d and \u201c-3dB.\u201d \u201cOverall\u201d describes the frequency range limits of the speaker within an amplitude drop off of 9dB. Any frequency reproduced more than 9dB down from the rest of the frequencies will contribute little to the sound. The \u201c-3dB\u201d spec describes the frequency range limits of the speaker within an amplitude drop off of 3dB.\nI just wrote this big article making the case that these kinds of numbers are not terribly useful in making buying decisions. So why does Polk use them? For better or for worse, these numbers are the norm in the audio industry.\nTo not publish them would leave an impression that our products were not competitive. A better question would be: why don\u2019t we publish frequency response and MLSSA graphs in addition to the simple numbers? We feel that these graphs would not be meaningful to the vast majority of consumers.\nIt takes years of working with measurements and loudspeakers before you get a good sense of how the graphs correlate to subjective sound quality. Incorrect interpretation of graphs can easily lead to misinformation and bad choices. Finally, the variation in measurement techniques can make comparing graphs from two different labs or manufacturers unreliable and misleading.\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission."

        "title": "The Best Record Cleaning Solutions: Exit to Vintage Street",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/record-cleaning-solutions/",
        "content": "When I went to Japan as an ESL teacher in my mid-20s, it marked not only a change of location and culture, but also a change from student to working adult (and I use the term \u201cadult\u201d loosely). With that change from student to worker came the need to buy a professional wardrobe, and as a poor recent graduate on a tight budget, that meant careful planning of items to be purchased pre-departure.\nDress pants, dress shirts, a blue blazer, dress shoes and several ties. All good, right? Unfortunately not. I arrived in the Land of Rising Tech sans belt, socks, tie-pin/bar (discovered I hated flappy ties), and overcoat (Sapporo in April can still be pretty chilly). I had most of the basics but felt incomplete for my first month or so until I got paid and could complete the wardrobe with necessary accessories.\nSo too for many of us audio lovers in our adventures setting up first systems or adding to existing ones. We plan out the budget, divvy it up by percentages for speakers and amp(s) and source(s), and think we\u2019re done. Then a few weeks (or months) later we find ourselves with multiple components stacked on top of each other on top of a turned over milk carton, speakers that don\u2019t sound right as they\u2019re not placed correctly and records that sound awful after a few plays as we\u2019ve nothing to clean them with.\nThis week and next I\u2019m going to take a tour through some of the accessories I\u2019ve picked up (and some that I haven\u2019t \u2013 yet) since getting into vintage audio and back into vinyl. Some I\u2019d classify as optional, but most are requirements if you really want to get the most out of your system, whether budget or high end. This week I\u2019m going to focus on clean records and improving the quality of your vinyl playback.\nA clean record sounds better. It also does something very important \u2013it extends the life of your cartridge.\nThe simplest record cleaner, great for dry environments, especially in winter. An anti-static brush reduces static and removes dust particles from your record before play. Mine is made byAudio Technica, but there are dozens of models out there. If you\u2019re wet cleaning your records every few plays or on a periodic basis, the anti-static brush should be enough to keep your records pop free in between deep cleanings. It won\u2019t clean very dirty records but is a good regular maintenance tool for your vinyl.\nI remember that in high school my mom used aDiscwashercleaning brush, and this was one of the first accessories I picked up for myself. This is basically a directional velvet-covered pad attached to a nice ergonomic wooden body. Spray some fluid on the leading edge of the velvet pad, wipe and and twist the brush in the direction of the grooves for a few rotations, and you have a nice clean record. It will never deliver the same level of cleaning as a record cleaning machine, but it\u2019s something.\nNot required every spin, but good every few plays. The old ones (from the \u201870s and \u201880s) had a nifty hollow in the hardwood body that held the little cleaning fluid bottle. In a cost-cutting effort (no doubt), the wood is lighter and cheaper, and the hollow is no more. Still a must-have item.\nThere are several different solutions for serious cleaning of records, costing into the thousands of dollars. An ultrasonic cleaner (like those from Degritter or CleanerVinyl) or a vacuum cleaner (Okki Nokki and Pro-Ject VC-S are quite well known) will do a superb job but may be an investment too far for someone just getting started. VPI have been manufacturing record cleaning machines for almost 40 years with the entry-level model running almost $700.\nThe Library of Congress in Washington D.C. was using the top VPI model for its work in regard to the National Archives but we\u2019re talking about a unit that runs over $3,000 and was being used to clean thousands of records. A robust unit for sure but probably not for the average collector.\nRecord cleaning machines are very noisy. Our Editor-in-Chief, Ian White uses both a VPI HW-19 andRecord Doctor VI(we\u2019re giving one away later this month) in his laundry room at home because it is far away from the rest of the house where it can be heard even with the television on. Both machines also have to be emptied after each batch of records; their respective reservoirs can only hold a limited amount of dirty water and cleaning solution.\nThere is no shortage of record cleaning fluids on the market and just as many opinions in regard to which solution cleans the best and does the least damage to your records. There are various means of applying and rinsing off the (straight or diluted) fluid and then drying the record.\nI opted for a simple, manualSpinClean\u00a0Mk. IIrecord bath. At well under a hundred bucks, the price was right, and I have to say I\u2019ve been impressed with the results. The Spin Clean has a narrow bath section, cleaning pads on each side, and roller guides at each end; fill the bath section with water, put in a capful of cleaning fluid, insert a record between the pads and spin clockwise and counter-clockwise three times each, then remove and dry with the supplied towels. Do enough records in one session and you can dispense with the daily workout.\nI buy a lot of records on Discogs, and the first thing I do when they arrive is give them a thorough cleaning. Early on I wasn\u2019t doing this, and I had records that played at a G+ or VG level jump up a couple of grading points after I did finally give them a good bath and towel-off. This I consider one of my best accessory buys.\nTo me there doesn\u2019t seem to be much point to cleaning your records if your cartridge stylus is dirty. Over time, any dirt and gunk you haven\u2019t managed to remove from your records (with whatever cleaning method you\u2019re using) gets carved out and builds up on the stylus. This in turn can result in a) reverse transfer of dirt back to your records from the stylus, and b) impact on vibration of the stylus in the record grooves and thus the sound emitted by your cartridge.\nAs I mentioned previously, a dirty cartridge doesn\u2019t last very long and with re-tip prices getting rather expensive, it takes only a few seconds to carefully clean your stylus. The simplest stylus cleaning solution is a stylus brush (these cost next to nothing), but overzealous or faulty use of the brush could result in damage to the stylus. If you do opt for a brush always brush parallel to the stylus from back to front. Never the other way, and never sideways.\nFor the vinyl lover, I\u2019d classify all four of these accessories as essential. Having a clean front end to your vinyl system (the records and your stylus) will extend the life of both records and stylus and maximise the quality of sound transmitted to the rest of your system. A basic collection of anti-static, cleaning and stylus brushes will set you back around $50. My set of four comes in at a bit under $200. Whatever solution you settle for, a small investment now will reap rewards in the long run.\nNext week we\u2019ll look at a few more accessories that, though perhaps less essential, can have a big impact on enjoyment of your audio journey. If you have any accessory suggestions, leave a comment, or message me on Instagram at@audioloveyyc.\nMore Vinyl Playback Articles:5 Best Vinyl Accessories to Upgrade Your Record Listening\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission."

        "title": "Klipsch KLF-30 Speakers: Exit to Vintage Street",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/klipsch-klf-30/",
        "content": "On March 15thI had the opportunity to hear my second ever pair of Klipsch loudspeakers. In a great example of the virtual becoming reality, an Instagram friend Scott (@scotty_scotchdog, who I had never met in person) invited myself and fellow IG friend Kevin (@mistachen, who I also first met on Instagram and then a couple of times in person), to a Scotch tasting/audio testing party.\nLocal audio store owner Kurt (@the_audio_room, who I\u2019d met a few times at the store) provided the audio equipment in the form of Hegel and NAD DAC/amplifiers for a head-to-head shootout, with Scott\u2019s Klipsch KLF-30 speakers providing the familiar (to him) sound output.\nScott had found me through my whisky Instagram account, and through that I\u2019d discovered his KLF ownership. Pure#AudioPornspeakers. We had messaged back-and-forth quite a bit, with him asking for Scotch recommendations, and had plenty of discussions about audio components, speakers and music. I was glad to finally meet Scott, and see Kevin and Kurt again, but part of me was just there to finally hear the Klipsch KLF-30 speakers.\nI\u2019d been curious about Klipsch, and particularly the popular, retro-styled \u201cHeritage\u201d Series (Heresy, Forte, Cornwall, La Scala and Klipschorn) since getting into vintage audio. The first and only Klipsch I had heard up to that point were theQuartets(1989-96), which I had owned for a little over a year. Though not officially Heritage speakers, they were a fit looks-wise; like a big Heresy with deeper bass (10\u201d woofer and 12\u201d rear passive, as opposed to the Heresy\u2019s 12\u201d woofer).\nI loved the look of the Quartets, but\u00a0never could get them to sound right with the equipment I had at the time. They were good with jazz, chamber music, acoustic \u2013 anything detailed and textured, without too much going on \u2013 but with louder, more complex rock or orchestral music, output lost cohesion and came across as dry and harsh. I raised them, adjusted toe-in, moved them closer to the rear wall and then farther out, changed my seating position; no matter what I did, there was something off.\nI had not purchased a tube amp yet (Klipsch and tubes are a heaven-made match, but my Dynaco ST-70 was still a year in the future), but in retrospect feel that could have been an answer.\nScott\u2019s KLFs were a different story. Whether with Hegel or NAD, they sounded big, and there was an abundance of bass. I\u2019m not a bass-head, but I do like a solid low end and the KLF-30 had it in spades. There was also a good balance between bass, midrange and treble that was true no matter what we listened to. They sounded cohesive and I loved them.\nA mind expanded by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions.\nThe sad thing about an experience like the evening at Scott\u2019s is that I had a new audio benchmark, and I spent the next few weeks comparing the sound of my own speakers to that. My dissatisfaction with the Quartets only grew. I let Scott know that if he ever decided to get rid of his KLFs, I wanted first dibs. He told me it was unlikely, but that yes, I\u2019d be first in line.\nNot only do the Klipsch\u00a0KLF-30 sound big; they are big, standing 115cm tall (45\u201d) and weighing a burly 46.3kg (102 lbs). Part of the Legend Series (30, 20, 10 and C7 centre) introduced in 1996 and manufactured until 2001, the Klipsch KLF-30 feature a three-way driver system with 1\u201d K-79 tweeter compression driver (with 90\u02da x 40\u02da exponential horn), 1.5\u201d K-52 midrange compression driver (with 90\u02da x 60\u02da Tractrix Horn\u00ae) and two 12\u201d K-31 woofers (with oversize magnet structure).\nFrequency response is a very decent 36Hz to 20 kHz, and sensitivity is (rated) 102 dB @ 1 watt/1 meter, and nominal impedance is 8 ohms. On paper, a speaker which will play well with anything.\nI got it in my mind that I should get something tall with a big box like the KLFs. If I couldn\u2019t have the real thing, I wanted something close. Soon after the mind-expanding evening, I found a set of ESS PS4As advertised on Kijiji (Canada\u2019s Craigslist). Double 10\u201d woofers (one active, one passive) and small Heil AMT (Air Motion Transformer) ribbon tweeter.\nNot as big box-wise as the KLF-30s, but still on the larger side at 99cm tall (39\u201d). Rated similarly at 35Hz to 24kHz, and sensitivity of 96 dB @ 1 watt/3 feet and a 6 ohms impedance.\nI tried them out and liked what I heard (not as big sounding as the KLFs, but adequate levels of bass, great balance and sweet midrange and highs). They came home with me, and the Quartets were quickly sold on. Ironically, they guy who bought the Quartets brought over an old Marantz 2230 receiver to test them with, and the Quartets never sounded better to my ears. Goes to show the importance of synergy.\nA bit over a year on and a few months into the pandemic, Scott messaged me. \u201cDo you still want my KLFs?\u201d He was taking the plunge on some Tannoy loudspeakers and the Klipsch KLF-30 speakers were now surplus to requirements. Did I still want the KLFs? I was mighty happy with my ESS, but dammit yes, I wanted these legends. A deal was struck, and a few days later Scott and I lugged two 102 lb monsters down into my basement and they were mine. All mine.\nAnd now, a year on, what do I think? Do the Klipsch KLF-30 speakers play well with everything? I would have to say yes. I\u2019ve run them in all kinds of set-ups and combinations; and while they do sound different, they always sound good. Very good.\nWith the diminutive Sansui AU-555, rated at 20 watts/channel and damping factor\u00a0(control over the movement of the speaker cone, particularly in the bass region)\u00a0set to high (45), the sound is big and beefy. This is with the volume pot set to somewhere between 2 and 3. Bass is solid with good slam and control.\nThe midrange and highs are detailed, and extension is excellent. Overall tonal balance is spot on, and I\u2019d be happy enough with this combination if it was the only system available to me. Proof that an efficient speaker with a low-powered amp can work extremely well, with no compromise to sound quality.\nWith the bigger Sansui AU-999, rated at 50 watts/channel and a damping factor of 45, output is similar. A bit cleaner and leaner, with less beef. More refined and \u201caudiophile.\u201d Many 999 owners lament (somewhat) a lack of bass punch and here that reputation is born out; this is no fault of the KLF-30. That said, this combination is still very satisfying and extremely musical.\nThrow the 35 watts/channel Dynaco ST-70 tube power amp into the mix with the AU-999 operating in preamp mode, and magic starts to happen. The Dynaco adds warmth, and a pinch more low end than the 999 alone. Bass is thick without being flabby, with impactful dynamics and speed (there\u2019s thwack to the attack). Midrange and treble are well defined and balanced, neither recessed nor forward. The Klipsch-plus-tubes adage is very, very true and the result is something I could listen to \u2018til the cows come home. Wonderfully balanced with just the right amount of presence and size.\nThe one KLF-30 spec that I have yet to mention is output power; nominal 200 watts and maximum 800 watts each. These things can handle a lot of juice. So, out of curiosity, we replace the Sansui/Dynaco pairing with a NAD solid state combo of 3020 (as pre-amp) and a 150 watts/channel 2600 power amp. Damping\u00a0factor of 100. For bass-heads, this\u00a0is where you want to be. Attack and decay of the low end are incredibly defined; there\u2019s thunder with no flab at all. The midrange and treble are still very balanced sounding but more dynamic and engaging. Not something I do much, but volume can be turned way up, and the speakers maintain composure. Efficient yes, but also very muscular.\nSuffice it to say, I am 100% satisfied with the Klipsch KLF-30 speakers. Actually \u2014 99.9%. Every now and then, the vintage-purist, OCD part of my brain whispers, \u201c1996 is not vintage; your speakers are too new!\u201d Many define vintage audio as being manufactured pre-1985 (while in the automobile world anything older than 25 years is vintage). If the KLF-30s were cars, the first ones off the line would now just fall in the vintage category. As audio equipment, they\u2019re a decade too late.\nWhat to do? What to do? Perhaps a set of 2ndgeneration Fortes or Cornwalls are in my future. Probably Cornwalls\u2026"

        "title": "Iconic Sansui Amplifiers: Exit to Vintage Street",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/iconic-sansui-amplifiers/",
        "content": "In my last year of high school, my brother came home one day with an old integrated amplifier. His boss at his part-time job (where he stripped and refinished old furniture) was clearing out his basement and gave it to him. Surplus to requirements.\nI had a system of my own already but do remember thinking it looked somewhat cool. Black brushed metal face plate. Silver knobs. Black selector switches. Homemade wood case. Even then, in the early \u201880s, it was a retro-looking piece.\nNot sure how much use that old amp got as my brother wasn\u2019t a huge music nut. I was never aware of him having speakers or other equipment to use it with. He had a monster JVC ghetto blaster that probably got more use. I went off to university the following year and didn\u2019t think about it again.\nFast forward 35 years. I get an email from my brother asking about the best way to get rid of his old amp. Photo attached. Sansui AU-555. At this point I\u2019m justgetting (back) into vintage audio. \u201cBest way is to give it to me\u201d was my immediate, excited reply. And so it came to me, and after a short stay withThat Old Retro Storegetting checked over and re-capped, became part of my then small but growing vintage audio set-up.\nJapanese audio was hot from the late 1960s to the early 1980s. With quality high and prices low, North American consumers bought up equipment from brands like Pioneer, Sony, Technics, Sansui, Kenwood and others by the truckload. And now, with the resurgent popularity of vintage audio, these brands are again hot commodities.\nIn my mind,Sansuiis the iconic vintage Japanese audio brand. Luxman and Accuphase fans might object to that statement and I can\u2019t disagree from a quality perspective \u2013 but we\u2019re talking about a different level of affordability. Few Japanese audio brands have the same, close-to-rabid following, particularly when it comes to integrated amplifiers and receivers. Yes, they made respectable tuners, speakers and turntables, but amplification was their jam; the proof-in-the pudding is reflected in today\u2019s rarity (they\u2019re around, but folks don\u2019t like to part with their treasures) and high prices when they do come up for sale.\nSansui Electric was established in 1947 and released their first tube\u00a0amplifier into the market in 1954. Several other amplifiers and receivers followed, but it wasn\u2019t until 1965 that they really made a mark with the AU-111 tube pre-main (integrated) amplifier,\u00a0known as the \u201cblack panel ancestor.\u201d At 40 watts per channel, the AU-111 was something of a powerhouse for its time, and it would stay in production into the early 1970s. To buy an AU-111 now takes crazy money.\nIn 1967, Sansui introduced their first solid-state integrated amplifier, the AU-777. This was followed in 1969 with several other models in the XXX series, including the AU-555 and the AU-999. Release dates are hard to pin down as individual models were introduced haphazardly (not in organized series groupings), but rough estimates have:\nSeveral series of receivers were also released in the late \u201860s and through the \u201870s, including the venerable 800 in 1968, The \u201csingle digit\u201d series (Eight, Seven and Six) in 1973, XX1 series (881, 771, 661, etc.) in 1974, 9090 in 1975, other X0X0s (8080, 7070, etc.) in 1977, and the G-series receivers starting in 1978 and through to about 1982.\nAs the \u201880s approached, business took a downward turn for Sansui. The Yen appreciated in value, impacting sales of export models (on which Sansui had become highly dependent). Strong unions and a tradition of \u201clifetime employment\u201d in Japan made it hard to cut manufacturing staff to deal with cost pressures. Corners were cut elsewhere, including use of cheaper, lower-quality parts.\nQuality took a hit, as did Sansui\u2019s reputation, and sales fell further. Sansui shifted away from exports to focus on their domestic market, and slowly unravelled over the ensuing two decades. Sansui went out of business in 2014, but in truth had not been a force in the audio world for some 20 or more years before that.\nIn addition to the AU-555 passed on to me by my brother, I also own a \u201ctop of the XXX line\u201d AU-999, purchased on eBay about a year after getting the 555. I\u2019d read about the wonderful tube-like sound of the 999 and lucked into one in good cosmetic condition at a reasonable price from a local seller, so no need to worry about shipping damage or added costs for this 38.5 lb (17.5 kg) monster to get to me (the seller even delivered it to my office downtown). I count myself lucky as I\u2019ve watched this model almost double in price in the four years I\u2019ve had it.\nAs mentioned, the AU-555 needed a recap to get it running properly. In the five years since coming back from the shop, it has been rock solid. This 20 watts/channel amplifier (all you really needed in the early \u201870s driving efficient speakers, the norm for the times) has a big and beefy sound, with solid bass slam and control, and balanced detailed midrange and decent treble extension.\nI\u2019ve run the AU-555 in both integrated (pre-main) and pre-amp (through an external power amp) modes. As an integrated amp I\u2019ve runKlipsch KLF-30s, ESS PS4As and B&W DM1200s with no trouble, and the sound quality was wonderful. The juice-lovingKEF Calinda\u2019s(83 dB @ 1 watt/1 meter efficiency) present perhaps a challenge-too-far for this little amp, but that\u2019s a common issue even with my higher-powered amps.\nIn pre-amp mode with my 150 watts/channel NAD 2600, the AU-555 performs well, particularly with the KEFs. I\u2019ve also run the AU-555 as pre-amp with the 35 watts/channel Dynaco ST-70 tube amp. The little Sansui\u2019s pre-out is quite hot, so gain on the NAD needs to be dialed back to allow for fine volume adjustment and full-range use of the volume pot beyond an ear-blasting 2. With the Dynaco, gain can\u2019t be controlled in this way, so things get loud pretty quick.\nAlthough good things are written about how clear and tubey the AU-999 sounds \u2013 realistic presentation of room ambiance and dynamics, pearlescent midrange, and smooth, warm and organic acoustics overall \u2013 it also has a reputation for a lean low end. It\u2019s definitely\u00a0cleaner-sounding than the 555 \u2013 more refined and \u201caudiophile\u201d \u2013 but in its native state does have less bass slam.\nThe 999 was a different story service-wise. Not long after I got it, I started to notice some crackle in both channels at low volumes or when nothing was playing. Not surprising really with an almost 50 year-old amp. I figured I\u2019d probably need to take it in for a service soon when I bought it, and so in it went.\nTurns out it needed more than just a simple recap (although some capacitors were replaced). The amp suffered from a pretty severe channel imbalance, which was rectified with a new volume pot and replacement of the output transistors. As per mod discussion (KevZep) onAudioKarma, the subsonic filter was removed, and some other circuit tweaks were done to improve bass and clarity. The result was a more muscular sounding 999, benching 55+ watts/channel and with better (still not massive, but improved) bass response.\nI\u2019ve used the AU-999 in similar set-ups to the AU-555, with the same speakers and as pre-amp with the same power amplifiers. On its own (in integrated mode) it has a more audiophile presentation than the 555 with less \u201cthickness.\u201d It displays more authority with the inefficient KEF Calinda\u2019s, but I prefer it combined with the NAD 2600 with those speakers. I like the AU-999 in integrated amp mode but love it as a pre-amp both with the Dynaco ST-70 and the NAD; both power amplifiers negate any bass deficiencies and allow the wonderful musicality of the Sansui to shine through.\nIn spite of \u201cissues,\u201d I\u2019m very satisfied with my AU-999. I love the AU-555 too, but it doesn\u2019t get a lot of use these days; I keep it more for nostalgic reasons than anything (a topic I plan to address in a future article).\nI haven\u2019t heard any of the other Sansui products from their golden age, but there are several that have piqued my interest. Of the XXX range, I understand the AU-777 (or more precisely the AU-777A) is the one to own from a pure sonic perspective. The AU-9500 is also desirable for its combination of sonic purity, clean appearance and power (75 old-school watts/channel is pretty solid for an integrated amp).\nFor pure power and refinement, I\u2019d love one of the BA series (3000 or 5000) power amplifiers to use with the AU-999 as pre-amp, or one of the CA (control amplifier) range of pre-amplifiers. And then of course, the ultimate would be the one that really started it all for Sansui: the AU-111\u00a0pre-main tube amplifier. That would be a blast!\nWhat else should I consider? Would love your input on an expanded wish list.

        "title": "The Vintage Marantz Dilemma: The Budget Audiophiler",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/vintage-marantz-dilemma/",
        "content": "Vintage Marantz components have seen some dramatic price increases of late and there is an increasing amount of debate on whether or not those prices are warranted. Supply and demand plays a huge part in all of this because nobody is manufacturing this equipment anymore; I think it\u2019s fair to say that vintage Marantz gear is more popular than the current lineup.\nMarantz made some excellent equipment during specific periods and there is a specific aesthetic that clearly appeals to a lot of music listeners and people who appreciate the industrial design.\nI have a Marantz 2245 and since I purchased it almost three years ago, the prices have doubled and for some examples in mint condition \u2014 even tripled. The aesthetic of the 2200 Series is no doubt iconic with its silver face, black accents, blue/green lighting and of course the fonts. The sound is always described as the \u201cwarm Marantz sound.\u201d\nThe 2245 features the standard equalizer adjustments of the time but also a midrange adjustment dial as well. I am personally a fan of the mid adjustment dial, because with the music that I listen to, it can bring the vocals a little more forward in the mix.\nIt also delivers 45 watts/channel and was designed to properly drive the loudspeakers of the period. Marantz were smart enough to include preamp outputs so that users could add an external power amplifier to their system.\nPutting all of those accolades aside, vintage Marantz equipment has pushed away from the dock and is no longer \u201cbudget\u201d which means that we need to explore some alternatives.\nDo they exist?\nThey certainly do and let\u2019s move on to some solid-state alternatives between $250-$500.\nThe first alternatives are the mid-\u201870s Harman Kardon Twin Power 730 or 430 models that I discussed inthis article. Both units are really solid options if you can find one in excellent shape.\nThe oldest model on my list is theHeathkit AR-1500A; which had its debut in 1967 (as the AR-15) and was a very hefty piece of steel weighing almost 35 pounds. The 60 watts/channel amplifier was sold in both kit form and prebuilt direct from the factory.\nThe specific model in my collection came from the factory and sold for $650 plus an additional $35 for the optional wood case in 1971. That\u2019s an astonishing $4,303 in 2021. For a Heathkit.\nThe tonal balance is rather warm and almost tube-like in its presentation.\nA bit of perspective, I normally listen to vintage equipment with the loudness button on, the bass dialed back, and treble tilted slightly higher.\nI rarely have to do this with the Heathkit; it\u2019s far bolder sounding than you might expect.\nThe styling of the Heathkit is certainly that of the late 1960\u2019s and the bulbs behind the green tuner display may benefit from an LED update to brighten the dial.\nOverall, I have been quite surprised with the build quality and sound from this unit. I think I would be hard pressed to find anyone who wouldn\u2019t enjoy the sound from the Heathkit AR-1500A and expect to pay between $200-$250 for a unit in decent shape.\nI\u2019m calling the next alternative the \u201cDon\u201d because it looks like it could have come off the set ofMad Men.\nThe Bogen BR-360 (this particular model is the rare BR-360W with the decorator white cabinet and tangerine-accented panel) was manufactured in 1969 and this receiver delivers 60 watts/channel into 8 ohms. It has a bold look and I rather like the push buttons and linear slide control styling.\nIn real world performance, it has zero difficulty driving myOhm 3XO speakers. It\u2019s definitely more than enough for most vintage and modern speakers within limits; you can\u2019t drive a pair ofWilson Audio loudspeakerswith it.\nThe tonal balance and presentation are vintage solid-state; there is a similarity to the vintage Marantz 2200 Series, and it probably comes the closest of all of these suggestions.\nIn addition to the loudness and bass/treble adjustments, this model features a \u201cCrescendo\u201d control which Bogen states will electronically expand or compress the sound without distortion.\nFrom a visual perspective, the Bogen BR-360W is a very unique looking product and is now part of my permanent collection. I\u2019m also increasingly impressed with its clarity and overall tonal balance. Yes \u2013 I did purchase it because the industrial design is very unique, and it is the source of many questions from guests.\nAlthough somewhat rare, these can be found in the $200 range. Very few people know the Bogen product lineup, and this is definitely a strong budget purchase.\nMy final suggestion this week is a big departure from the models above that were offered in the 1960s and 1970s.\nThe Kyocera (they also make knives) R-861 is from the mid-1980s and a very interesting piece that clearly flew under the radar. This 100 watts/channel receiver has impressed me so much that it has earned a place in the system that we use the most in our home.\nThis is clearly a \u201cmodern\u201d design with the majority of its buttons and dials hidden behind a panel on the front of the unit. The tuner is digital and only a single red LED light indicates that it is powered on and which input has been selected.\nThe Kyocera R-861 offers the ability to adjust the bass, midrange, and treble and I found the range of adjustments to be quite useful. You can certainly keep the fairly neutral tonal balance as it is or add some warmth to the sound.\nBoth the CD and Phono inputs are gold plated.\nThe phono preamp is the biggest surprise with this unit; it works exceptionally well with the MM cartridges that I\u2019ve tried so far and might be the best part of the unit in terms of its sonic capabilities. It\u2019s clear that Kyocera\u2019s engineers still considered vinyl playback to be the most important source when this component was designed.\nI have also managed to find the matching CD player and remote control which makes operation of both components that much easier.\nThe only issue with the Kyocera R-861 is that word has already spread in the vintage audio community about the quality of this particular unit. You can still find a unit in good condition, but demand has begun to affect the prices; expect to pay $300-$400 right now.\nSo does that mean that you shouldn\u2019t look for vintage Marantz components? Absolutely not.\nJust be more realistic about what people are asking for their components and don\u2019t be disappointed if the prices push them out of reach right now.\nAll of the above picks or the HK 430/730 are worth searching for. Adjust the sound to your liking, or add an external amplifier (tube or solid state) to increase the output as all of the above can be used as a preamp with the exception of the Bogen BR-360W.\nYou may find a fantastic deal on a Marantz out there, but until then, these are some rock solid alternatives. Obviously these are not the only choices, post your favorite budget receivers in the comments!\nI\u2019d like to personally thank@retrodiggsfor providing me with the serviced Bogen and the Heathkit receivers.\nRelated reading:The Budget Audiophiler: Learning to Fly with the Pilot 602 Tube Receiver\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission."

If you scroll through the features of most of these amplifiers, you\u2019ll notice that many offer support forTIDAL Connect, Spotify Connect,Roon,Qobuz, Chromecast, Apple AirPlay 2, and different Bluetooth codecs.\nWhat features should you look for when selecting a new integrated amplifier or network amplifier?\nA subwoofer outputto conveniently connect apowered subwoofer. This output may or may not include a low-pass crossover or bass management settings.\nDigital Inputssuch as USB, Optical Toslink or Coaxial enable enable connectivity to external music sources such asCD playersordigital music streamers. Such inputs mean the amplifier has an internal DAC.\nA USB inputto access digital music locally from USB stick, hard drive, laptop, tablet or computer.\nA headphone outputgenerally means the amp includes a special amplifier just for headphones, mainlyaudiophile headphoneswith high impedance requirements. Ideally it makes headphone listening sound better.\nA remote controlis usually included, but not always.\nBuild quality matters. Circuit design does too. And most importantly, equipment matching to speakers and other devices matters more than one would think.\nDo not be seduced or turned off by power ratings. Someloudspeakersonly require a few watts into an 8 ohm load, while others require an amplifier that can double its output into 4 ohms and is stable at that impedance. You are more likely to damage a loudspeaker with less power than more.\nShould you go with a tube or solid-state integrated amplifier? Tube amplifiers certainly require more hands-on maintenance and it is incorrect to state that all tube amplifiers have a \u201cwarm\u201d or \u201crich\u201d sound. Not all solid-state amplifiers are neutral sounding; we can think of more than a few that are darker or warmer sounding than some tube amplifiers.\nRemember to budget accordingly when building your stereo system. This guide should provide a great starting point for building your first stereo system or upgrading an existing one.\nWhether you\u2019re looking for a purist integrated stereo amplifier or one packed with features, we think these are some of the best to buy right now for the money.\nLearn more:A British Audiophile Review\nLearn more:See our full review\nLearn more:See our full review.\nLearn more:See our Rega IO Audiophile System Builder\nLearn more:See our full review.See Tarun\u2019s video review.\nLearn more about the Powernode.\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission.\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

A sonic Stradivarius, the craftsman, engineer, businessman and inventor holds dozens of patents for his breakthroughs, many of which he harnessed when introducing the Klipschorn loudspeaker in 1946. Known to obsessives as a corner-horn speaker, Klipschorns are built with a Klipsch-invented horn-loaded tweeter and midrange compression driver. The company\u2019s patented folded-horn 15\u2033 woofer produces low-frequencies that seem to flood the floor.\nLike many geniuses, Klipsch had an extremely organized mind but \u2013 as illustrated in the two-part documentary below \u2013 worked among a mess of scattered gear, papers, prototypes and experiments.\nIn 1991, a semi-retired Klipsch invited a videographer into the company\u2019s Hope manufacturing plant (where the company\u2019s headquarters remain) for a (very) casual tour of the facility, including Klipsch\u2019s lab and its hand-built anechoic chamber. Though it\u2019s hardly a professionally-made documentary, the video is a revelatory glimpse at how one visionary, armed only with curiosity, ambition, brains and drive, created exquisite products, the kind that not only produced magnificent sound but whose minimalist design were visually stunning.\nWatch part 1 here:\nPart 2:\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

But as I was watching a superb video fromCheapaudiomanthe other night at 3 a.m., I realized that there is a growing movement within the community that understands that high-end audio can\u2019t grow without a serious conversation about affordability and teaching people how to properly build a system within a budget that doesn\u2019t involve selling a kidney.\nI\u2019ve been there.

I had multiple pairs of perfectly fine MartinLogan loudspeakers that I am on some fanatical quest to reclaim and start from scratch with again.\nDo you want to know why?\nBecause there was nothing wrong with them.\nNone of us hate really expensive high-end products. Some of them really push the performance envelope and that\u2019s a good thing if the technology eventually trickles down into products that are more affordable.\nBut is that really happening on the loudspeaker side?\nI see it on the digital front with better quality DACs getting more affordable; Schiit Audio, Denafrips, Helm Audio, and many others should take a bow.\nPeople getting into high-end audio for the first time do have a lot of quality affordable loudspeakers to select from in 2021, but once you get out of that category, the prices escalate rather quickly.\nHow many people jump from $500 speakers to $2,000 or $5,000 speakers?\nThe more I think about it \u2014 the more I understand the interest in used high-end and vintage components, but the flip side to all of that is that demand is pushing prices a lot higher.\nI desperately want a pair of MartinLogan Aerius i (oak finish) in great condition; but I\u2019m not going to pay a stupid price for them because I will need to replace the panels almost immediately because they were designed to only last 15 years.\nWhat about Vandersteen? I wrote about theVandersteen 1Ci speakersin my recentAudiophile System Builder columnand the feedback from a number of readers was that it was about time that someone in the audio press covered these speakers which are still in production.\nThe Vandersteen 1Ci speakers are not old enough to qualify as vintage audio (give them another 12 years and they will) but these American-made floorstanders are almost 8 years old at this point and still very much in production. The Vandersteen 1C were available back in 1996 so the earliest versions of the speaker are almost as old as the generation who probably need to listen to them the most.\nThe Vandersteen 2 (and all of its variants) loudspeakers have been in production since 1977 with more than 100,000 pairs sold; a remarkable number that very few high-end brands could ever hit with even their entire lineup.\nThe Vandersteen customer is a loyal one; most started with the Vandersteen 2 or Vandersteen 1 and have moved up the food chain over the years at great expense. The top Vandersteen loudspeakers now retail for almost $65,000.\nWhat makes the Vandersteen 1Ci so compelling is that you can find it used rather easily if you are prepared to look and you are unlikely to spend more than $900 for them even if they are in excellent condition. A brand new pair costs almost $1,700 so consider that 48% discount to be a huge bargain.\nRichard Vandersteen did some creative things with his original designs and that thought process has continued with the 1Ci that still don\u2019t have a loudspeaker cabinet; a huge cost savings for both the manufacturer and customer.\nSince its inception, Vandersteen has always focused on putting better quality woofers and tweeters and crossover components into its designs and less on the cabinet\nRichard Vandersteen has always taken a performance-first approach with the Model 1Ci focusing on the internals, with a first-order crossover, minimum front baffle, and time-aligned design.\nThe Model 1Ci is a time- and phase-correct speaker constructed in such a way that the alignment and positioning of the drivers allow a point-source wave front and maximize the phase coherence of the loudspeaker at the listening position.\nThe listening position and loudspeaker setup are critical with every Vandersteen design but the Model 1Ci benefits from very careful set-up; more than most speakers I\u2019ve tried over the years regardless of cost.\nThe active components used in the Model 1Ci combine classic strength and durability with innovative design and construction. The8-inch wooferuses the same type of cast-metal basket used in costly esoteric loudspeakers. The cast-metal basket\u2019s inherent rigidity and superior vibration resistance increase cone movement accuracy and reduce sympathetic resonances for cleaner and more natural sound.\nThe 1-inch metal alloy dome tweeter is a dual chamber design to improve range and linearity. It is critically damped to extend the high frequencies past audibility without the excessive ringing associated with open or underdamped metal dome tweeters.\nThe specific alloy used for the dome was chosen for its superior strength and resistance to break-up compared to common fabric and plastic domes. The quality materials and advanced features of the Model 1Ci\u2019s tweeter result in smooth and accurate response throughout the audible range.\nThe 1Ci no longer uses traditional banana posts but screw-down terminals instead which are directly wired to the crossover.\nThe Vandersteen 1Ci are a chunky 44 pounds and 36\u2033H x 12\u2033W x 10\u2033D; making them a rather hefty 2-way floorstanding loudspeaker on custom stands manufactured by Sound Anchors.\nSo why are we so impressed by these speakers that have dozens of competitors below $2,000 new?\nThe 1Ci are 90 dB and a relatively benign 6.8 ohm load making them a very easy loudspeaker to drive. Tubes and solid state work great with these speakers.\nCan you drive them with 35-50 watts of power? In a smaller room, you won\u2019t need any more power than that and the focus should be more on the quality of those watts versus looking for a blowtorch to open these loudspeakers up. A slightly larger room can work but 50-100 watts might be a better scenario.\nThere are some excellent vintage amplifiers that will work with these speakers but I would focus on those that can output a minimum of 35-50 watts if you lean in that direction.\nThe Vandersteen 1Ci can sound dreadful if you get the setup wrong. I\u2019ve heard them go from simple average to great with 20 minutes of proper setup.\nThe setup requires very careful attention to the distance from both the side and front walls; make sure they are never the same dimensions. The key with these speakers is getting the time-alignment right and that requires some math and experimentation with the rake. You will find very clear instructions inside the manual and my advice is to follow them because they work.\nMore than most speakers in the category, the Vandersteen 1Ci have a unwavering sense of balance. No part of its tonal balance is tilted either way and it\u2019s definitely more neutral than warm sounding.\nThe absence of a cabinet also increases the transparency and soundstage depth and width.\nWith proper setup and the right amplifier, the 1Ci can sound quite large and recreate a huge stereo image. Get the rake of the loudspeaker wrong and the midrange can sound slightly closed-in and the treble slightly harder; a warmer sounding amplifier helps tame the tweeter with rock and EDM.\nYou can certainly crank the 1Ci but I think that\u2019s a mistake; moderate to conversation levels work better and allow you to discern more detail and hear more of the amplifier and the rest of your components.\nVandersteen makes better sounding speakers but the price grows rather exponentially as you move up the ladder and you can pay over $2,000 for a used pair of Model 2Ce Signature speakers.\nVandersteenjust announced a replacement for the 1Ci called the 1Ci+which offers some internal changes. The best part about that announcement is that prices for used 1Ci loudspeakers in solid condition are dropping.\nFor more information:vandersteen.com/products/model-1ci\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission.\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/the-advent-loudspeaker/",
        "content": "Once upon a time at an estate sale in the middle of Missouri, two lucky gear hunters stumbled across a beast of a sound system that, when first acquired in the 1970s, was dense with top of the line components. Driven by a massive Pioneer SX-1250 receiver, a Thorens TD 135 turntable, and an Aiwa AD-6400 cassette deck, the system was channeled into a pair of Advent Loudspeakers. They bought the lot for $200 and divided the riches.\nAudiophiles may have read the above rundown and stumbled on the Advents. Unlike the other components, when introduced into the market in the late 1960s the speakers were so shockingly affordable that many connoisseurs passed over them on the way to pricier, more aesthetically pleasing Klipsch, JBL and Acoustic Research models.\nAdvents, however, were built by a partnership that included sound engineer Henry Kloss, who had cofounded Acoustic Research before launching Advent in 1967. Kloss and a partner had earlier been responsible for a number of innovations, most notably a unique acoustic suspension system. With Advent, Kloss\u2019s goal was to build a brilliant speaker for the masses, one that would open ears to the possibilities and glories of audiophilia and listening.\nWhoever the Missouri estate seller was, they obviously had the means to purchase any pair of speakers on the market \u2013 and stuck with the Advents. They weren\u2019t alone: vintage Advents were a hit with young buyers and across the next decade the Boston-based company sold hundreds of thousands of sets.\nFifty years later, those simply-named speakers areubiquitous on the used marketplace, where, once again, they\u2019re often passed over by collectors searching for prettier, fancier speakers. That means that budget-minded searchers can track down a pair of Advent Loudspeakers \u2013 which were renamed Larger Advents after the introduction of the Smaller Advent Loudspeaker in the early 1970s \u2013 for a few hundred dollars. Hardcore fans argue that stacking two pairs delivers sound on par with systems double the cost.\nEarlier this month audio writer Ian White penned an excellent rundown ofbest vintage audio speakers for the modern audiophile, to inform those looking for guidance on new speakers. Consider this an asterisk to his invaluable overview.\nWhich is to say, at least one rural Missouri audiophile \u2013 and their inheritor (this writer, who landed those Advents and remains a disciple to this day after owning JBLs, B&Ws and ARs) \u2013 would suggest adding Advents to the list of vintage speakers to buy."

        "content": "Consumers and manufacturers love to wax poetically about \u201cvintage\u201d when it comes to loudspeakers and amplifiers but I\u2019m not sure I buy into it as much when it comes to most vintage loudspeakers.\u00a0Vintage speakers\u00a0require a lot of work and some luck if the previous owners have been less than gentle with them.\nA clumsy mover destroyed a pair of vintage Celestion Ditton 33 MKIIs that I had taken care of for over 13 years without a scratch. Getting the drivers replaced wasn\u2019t very easy and the cabinets were a loss.\nNostalgia is one powerful drug. The\u00a0vinyl revolutionwas certainly inspired by a heavy dosage of it but that isn\u2019t enough to sustain a movement. What has given vinyl\u2019s unexpected comeback some solid legs is that new generations have discovered\u00a0the benefits of ownership; the generation that grew up on iTunes and\u00a0Spotify\u00a0finally have a physical piece of media that they can own \u2013 just like their parents and older siblings.\nLoudspeaker manufacturers have taken that newfound interest in nostalgia and reintroduced updated versions of their most popular vintage audio speakers with a great deal of success so far.\nProducts like theWharfedale Linton HeritageandKlipsch Forte IVloudspeakers are all the proof one requires.\nAll of the loudspeakers on our list have sold well; the Linton Heritage has been an enormous success for Wharfedale and for good reason.\nSupply chain issues and inflationhave also made all of them more expensive. Our prices below have been updated to reflect an increase of over 10% or more for all of them so far in 2022.\nThe Linton Heritage have jumped from$1,499 to $1,799 USDwhich is not an insignificant amount of money if you are working with a tight budget.\nTheJBL have increased by $400and the Klipsch are now $5,000 USD which is a$500increase from January.\nKLH Audiois back in the game now with the brand newKLH Model Five($2,498/pair at AmazonorCrutchfield) that has earned rave reviews from both the press and consumers. Eric Pye has his rather in-depth review forthcoming at the end of May and he\u2019s put a lot of hours through his pair.\nThe company started by Henry Kloss, Malcom Low, and Josef Anton Hofmann in 1957 sold over 30,000 pairs of loudspeakers before it was sold off in 1964; the brand had numerous owners including Kyocera who stopped manufacturing audio components in 1989.\nKLH Audio is a new company owned by Klipsch and VOXX executive, David P. Kelley. The vintage audio vibe is very strong with the Model 5 and the backlog of orders is considerable.\nVintage audiohas never been more popular; ourtwo weekly columnsdeliver consistent traffic and comments that match the response to our most popular reviews of new products.\nThe interest invintage audio loudspeakershas never been higher; especially as brands continue to refresh popular models that have been around longer than most millennials who are getting into better sound quality for the first time.\nQuality matters. Especially when there is a premium attached to ownership.\nConsumers are willing to spend a lot of money; often more than the price of a new high-end system, for really rare vintage audio components from brands like McIntosh, Mark Levinson, Krell, and Quad \u2013 so it should not surprise anyone that people are very interested in new loudspeakers from some of the oldest high-end brands that pay homage to classic designs that once occupied the front covers of every Hi-Fi magazine.\nJBL, Klipsch, and Wharfedale have been manufacturing award-winning loudspeakers for almost 73 years; all three companies entered the loudspeaker business in 1946 run by three visionaries who had spent the previous decades working on loudspeaker drivers for other audio components such as radio consoles and movie theater loudspeaker systems. It is a remarkable bit of history that all three brands not only still exist but are category leaders and some of the most popular in the world.\nAll three have survived generational changes in listening habits, format wars, advancements in amplification technology, the home theater revolution, and the shift to active and wireless loudspeakers.\nAll of these selections have an old-school aesthetic but sound nothing like their predecessors; these are modern sounding loudspeakers with advanced driver technology and certainly require quality amplifiers and sources. Green shag carpeting is optional.\nWharfedale\u2019s founder, Gilbert Briggs built his first loudspeaker in 1932 in his home in Ilkey, Yorkshire; the town was based in the valley of the river \u201cWharfe.\u201d Briggs opened Wharfedale Wireless Works in 1933 supplying advanced loudspeaker drivers to the growing radio industry and the company became a leading supplier selling more than 9,000 units per year until the outbreak of World War II. The company flourished after the war and became one of the first companies to offer a two-way loudspeaker in 1945 \u2013 the prototype for the modern loudspeaker.\nWharfedale introduced the original Linton in 1965 and the model which utilized three drive units developed a strong following with its smooth midrange, punchy low end, and sense of scale. The model disappeared from their line-up in the 1970s but was recently reintroduced as the stand-mounted Linton Heritage. Wharfedale has also designed a custom stand for the Linton Heritage that puts the tweeter around 36\u201d from the floor and includes room for records as well.\nThe three-way loudspeakers are larger than mostbookshelf loudspeakersmaking the stands a logical accessory to maximize their performance. The modern Linton feature an 8-inch Kevlar cone woofer, 5-inch Kevlar cone midrange driver, and 1-inch soft dome tweeter. Listeners may decide to ditch the woven grille covers, but we think they give the Linton that old-school look that makes them stand out.\nWharfedale designed the Linton with two rear ports which requires giving these loudspeakers some distance from the wall behind them; the 8-inch woofer can deliver the goods playing Led Zeppelin with only 20 watts so don\u2019t confuse old with polite. The Linton Heritage offer all of the midrange resolution and natural sound of the original, but with a lot more detail, speed, and transparency.\nThey deliver scale and image rather well considering their boxy looking cabinet. If your budget can stretch to $1,500 which includes the stands, the Linton should be on your short list.\nThe Linton Heritage can work well with a lot of different amplifiers; Audiolab, Cambridge Audio, Naim, Croft Acoustics, Creek, and vintage amplifiers from Marantz, Audio Research, and Sansui are all solid options.\nFind your local dealer:https://www.wharfedale.co.uk/global-distributor/\nJames Bullough Lansing founded JBL in 1946, after the death of his partner, Ken Decker, with whom he had spent twenty years developing successful speaker drivers and movie theater sound systems under the Lansing Manufacturing Company brand name. Decker had been responsible for the business end of Lansing and his demise sent the company into a financial tailspin until it was acquired and renamed as Altec Lansing in 1941.\nBoth companies went their separate ways and Lansing introduced several innovative Alnico drivers that became signature JBL products over the decades. Lansing died in 1949, but the company pushed forward under the guidance of JBL\u2019s vice-president, Bill Thomas. JBL was eventually acquired by Sidney Harman who turned the brand into the world leader in pro audio, movie theater loudspeakers, and high-end systems that exists today.\nJBL introduced the original L-100 Century in 1970 and they soon became one of the best-selling loudspeakers of all-time. Priced at $250 each, The L-100 Century were derived from JBL\u2019s 4310 studio monitors and the home version were fussy beasts that needed space and a lot of power.\nThe L-100 were detailed and dynamic sounding loudspeakers that worked well with classic rock but were not the last word in refinement. Their trademark orange, blue, or black foam grille covers are still coveted by collectors today.\nJBL re-introduced the L-100 Classic in 2018and after the sticker shock wore off, audiophiles discovered that decades of driver innovation at JBL were something to appreciate in the new design.\nThe L-100 Classic utilize JBL\u2019s pure-pulp cone five-inch midrange drivers, 12-inch bass driver, and 1-inch Titanium dome tweeter in a stand-mounted loudspeaker that deliver all of the accuracy of the world\u2019s best studio monitors, but with a lot more finesse and a warmer tone than the original.\nThe L-100 Classic still require a lot of space and a powerful amplifier, but they fill a large room with ease and are one of the most dynamic sounding loudspeakers available for the price. If you crave an intense listening experience, the JBL are well worth an audition.\nFind your local dealer:https://www.jbl.com/specialty-audio-dealer-locator.html\nThere are few American loudspeaker brands as iconic as Klipsch. Founded by the late-Paul W. Klipsch in 1946 in a tiny shed in Hope, Arkansas, Klipsch has remained true to its founder\u2019s ideals for more than seven decades. Paul Klipsch developedthe legendaryKlipschornwith the premise of recreating the sound of live music in the home.\nThe corner horn Klipschorn have been in production for over 70 years and still deliver on Klipsch\u2019s four key design elements: high-efficiency/low distortion, controlled directivity, wide-dynamic range, and flat-frequency response.\nPaul Klipsch designed loudspeakers that were easy to drive, directed sound directly towards the listener in an attempt to minimize the room\u2019s impact on soundstage depth and width, could reproduce both the quietest and loudest sounds with both clarity and free of distortion, and sounded as transparent and uncolored as possible across the entire frequency spectrum.\nThe Klipsch \u201csound\u201d has remained true to Paul\u2019s technical goals but the boldness of the presentation hasn\u2019t always been for everyone. The physical size of the Klipschorn doesn\u2019t make them practical for most rooms, but the Heritage Forte IV loudspeakers are one of the most engaging loudspeakers available and the updated version are much easier to use in most listening spaces \u2013 with a few caveats.\nThe Forte was introduced in 1985, but there is considerable daylight between the original and the latest version that still looks like something your father had in his living room in the 1970s. The Forte IV are large, heavy, and unlikely to impress initially with their dated look.\nAll of that changes the moment you drive the super-efficientForte IVwith 10-15 watts of tube power and put some distance between the loudspeaker and your listening position. Music pours out of the Forte IV\u2019s drivers and smacks you in the face; in a good way that becomes more natural sounding once you get over the shock. This refreshed vintage audio speaker sounds much more dynamic than a lot of other new designs.\nUnlike other Klipsch models which can sound bright and forward sounding, the Forte IV sound more restrained without sacrificing the tone, dynamics, and sense of realism that they deliver. All genres of music work with the Forte IV and with warmer sounding amplifiers and sources, they make a lot of really super expensive audiophile loudspeakers sound rather lifeless.\nFind your local dealer:https://www.klipsch.com/products/forte-iv-floorstanding-speaker#buy-now\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission.\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "title": "The Budget Audiophiler: Fisher 400 Tube Receiver",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/budget-audiophiler-fisher-400/",
        "content": "The Budget Audiophiler is going to begin this week with a little rant. I need to vent aboutMcIntosh. The folks in Binghamton have my utmost respect, but they have created a problem that they can\u2019t fix. I\u2019m laying my obsessive love for tube amplifiers at their feet. I remember the first time I saw aMcIntosh MC240 stereo tube amplifierand just getting lost in the moment; almost becoming transfixed by the industrial piece of art and its illuminated exposed tubes.\nAt some point, I will own a McIntosh tube amplifier, but the cult surrounding these gorgeous vintage pieces has pushed the prices well out of reach. I\u2019m a practical person. I have a normal day job like everyone else, kids, mortgage payments, and I did what any other sane person in my position would do \u2013 I sold one of my organs as a down payment on that amplifier. Just kidding. Instead of obsessing in the short-term, I began conducting research and one amplifier began showing up in almost all of my searches; the Fisher 400.\nAnd so begins our little journey.\nI\u2019m a hunter. Not like Steve McQueen in his last film with the cool car chase in the tower in Chicago that ends rather violently in the river below \u2013 but a hunter of vintage audio. I hunt for audio bargains online and can smell one when I find it. The more I read about the Fisher 400 tube receiver, the more I realized that I might have discovered something wonderful that I never knew that I wanted. Finding a bargain in this scenario was most likely not going to pan out, but I was going to try.\nGrowing up in the 1980s, I remember Fisher as a manufacturer of mid-fi (I\u2019m being polite) receivers and stereo systems. Sanyo had purchased the company and brand name in 1975 (from Emerson who bought the brand in 1969) and nothing was ever the same. The products produced in the 1960s and 1980s are miles part; both in terms of sound quality, and the level of industrial design. The original Fisher products were gorgeous and designed for people who cared about sound quality.\nThe clarity from this amplifier manufactured almost 6 decades ago was startling. The detail, transparency, and level of engagement was superb.\nAvery Fisher started the Fisher Radio Corporation in 1945, and in the 1960s they focused on high-end tube audio components, consoles, and phonographs. The models that caught my eye were the 400, 500, and 800 (and their variants). Fisher was actually the first manufacturer to offer audio separates; McIntosh, Marantz, H.H. Scott, and Harmon Kardon would eventually do the same. \u201cThe Fisher\u201d was the actual brand name that was marketed.\nFisher\u2019s first receiver was the model 500, a mono AM/FM receiver using two\u00a0EL37\u00a0output tubes. It had a brass-plated face panel and an optional mahogany or \u201cblonde\u201d wooden case.\nAll three had different features and power ratings, but they were all tube receivers or integrated amplifiers. I set out to find one of these models, but I was seduced by the iconic \u201cbird\u201d icon featured on the 400 and 800 model receivers. The more I hunted for one of these tube receivers \u2013 the more I found myself drawn to all of the marketing material and catalogs that the brand produced.\nThey knew back then what a lot of modern brands forget \u2013 this is about lifestyle.\nAt the beginning of my journey two years ago, I was definitely in a learning phase in regard to tube technology. I had not yet learned how to solder and the last time I used a multi-meter, I set a small fire in my house. My wife wasn\u2019t so happy with the Budget Audiophiler that weekend.\nWith my pride slightly wounded, I had the intelligence to focus on finding a \u201cserviced\u201d model. That term means very different things to a lot of people. When looking for any kind of vintage component you really need to ask a lot of questions. There are no stupid questions when it pertains to plugging a 60 year-old piece of electrical equipment into a power receptacle.\nAt the very bottom of the list is the seller who claims that the unit is \u201cserviced\u201d but is unable or unwilling to provide you with the information to determine If that is true. You should avoid this type of transaction. Been there. Done that. Not a good result.\nAnother seller might claim that the unit is \u201cpartially serviced\u201d; which means that the unit has been tested and specific components that were out of spec or broken have been replaced. I would ask specific questions about which components were replaced, the timing of those repairs, and who performed them.\nAny seller who gets weird when you ask these questions should be a red flag.\nDemand exceeds supply in this particular case so expect to pay in the range of $400 \u2013 $1,400 for the Fisher 400 tube receiver.\nThe final seller might claim in their advertisement that the unit has undergone a \u201cfull restoration.\u201d The same comprehensive list of questions from #2 seller have to be applied here as well. I would also want to know which tubes (new or NOS) are being included in the transaction. Are they new or the from the original tube set?\nYou want a seller who knows the product and understands the nature of the changes that were made. If the \u201cfully restored\u201d unit is selling for an amount that seems too low (do your research), you might not be getting the full story.\nAfter a few near hits and a month of comprehensive searches, I found an excellent version of The Fisher 400 and bid. I was not successful at winning this specific model, but I did discover the type of seller that you want to work with. \u201cFrank\u201d (whom I found on eBay) was very open about all of the changes and modifications that he made to the models that he had for sale.\nWhat made him unique was that he focused specifically on Fisher components from the 1960s and was able to provide very detailed photographs and videos about each component. He was the type of seller who was methodical about the restorations performed. He only sourced the best possible examples of each model and had the entire component restored internally; brand new capacitors, new tubes (if required), new wiring, and with or without the refinished wood case.\nAfter building up some trust, he informed me that he had one of the \u201cbest\u201d model Fisher 400s coming in with the original \u201c65 watts\u201d sticker attached to the front panel. I decided to bite. We agreed to a fair price and I was elated.\nThe prices for vintage components like the Fisher 400 are rising. Substantially. Collectors know that there are a finite number of these prized components available, and that people are willing to spend to own one.\nTwo very long weeks passed before I received confirmation that the unit was ready. I made the decision to not purchase the restored wood case because it reduced the price by a few hundred dollars. I suspected that I would be able to find one at a later date and what kind of Heathen would want to cover up so many beautiful glowing tubes.\nThe seller also made a point of providing me with test results from the unit before it was shipped.\nWhen I received notification from FedEx that the unit could be picked up, I rushed out to get a case of my favourite cold nourishment, and drove home with a stupid grin on my face. The Crate & Barrel shipping box was a nice touch.\nThe Fisher 400 tube receiver that I purchased uses Electro Harmonix 7868 output tubes; the 65 watts of output make the receiver far more useful with more modern loudspeakers and its sound quality impresses me more and more with each new loudspeaker that I try with it.\nThe first night with the Fisher 400 was one of experimentation. I paired the receiver with Ohm 3X0s, Jensen Model 4s, EPI Time/Energy, and my prized Ohm Walsh F loudspeakers. All of them sounded amazing but I ended up keeping it paired with the Ohm Walsh 3X0.\nThe clarity from this amplifier manufactured almost 6 decades ago was startling. The detail, transparency, and level of engagement was superb.\nI have since added a case and some right-angle spade forks so that I can use loudspeaker cables terminated with banana pins. Not a huge amount of money and far preferable to bare wire.\nMy experience taught me that there are some reputable sellers out there and if you do your homework, there is a great chance of finding a solid example of this amplifier or one of the other models from the 500 or 800 series of amplifiers.\nAs I mentioned, demand exceeds supply in this particular case so expect to pay in the range of $400 \u2013 $1,400 for the Fisher 400 tube receiver.\nIf you can find one inside a console at an estate or garage sale, I can provide you with some guidance on getting it repaired or restored \u2014 and help you find a case.\nThe Fisher 400 is one of my greatest finds and will be part of our home for many years to come.\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission."

        "content": "A lot of ink has been spilt about the Klipsch RP-600M; I rather enjoyed my time with them but I also have firsthand experience with them driven by a lot of amplifiers and have been exposed to their limitations and warts over a much longer period of time.\nMost consumers will order them online without even an audition and that\u2019s often a recipe for disappointment if the rest of the system isn\u2019t a good match.\nI had the chance to listen to them again recently with another batch of amplifiers and I still stand by my original review; you learn something new every time you switch out an amplifier or source.\nOver the past year, I\u2019ve watched a number of YouTube videos where reviewers and even manufacturers of other loudspeakers have taken these loudspeakers apart to explain their limitations and also point out areas where they can be improved.\nI don\u2019t have an issue with the DIY crowd making \u201cimprovements\u201d to their samples but let\u2019s be honest \u2014 99% of the people buying these speakers are not taking them apart and I\u2019m pretty sure that most would screw them up somehow if they tried.\nUnless you know what you are doing \u2014 don\u2019t take apart your loudspeakers and get upset when they don\u2019t sound any different (or worse) based on what someone told you in a video.\nBack to Klipsch.\nKlipsch have been in business more than 70 years but the past 5 years must feel like some serious vindication for them. I\u2019m not going to burst that balloon because they deserve their current success; and all of the bootlicking coming from the high-end press.\nTake a bowKlipsch Audio RP-600M.\nBootlicking? An endless supply and it must feel rather sweet going down \u2013 like some of that fine Kentucky Bourbon.\nThe RP-600M are not even part of their vaunted \u201cHeritage\u201d Series but I\u2019m 100% certain that Klipsch would sell out of a Heritage RP-600M model if it were ever introduced. I would buy the first pair.\nFor years, the high-end press told audiophiles that Klipsch were for home theater customers; that no serious music listener should consider them.\nTwo of our columnists usevintage Klipsch loudspeakersat home and I trust their ability to discern excellent sound quality. Klipsch never stopped making great loudspeakers. The audiophile press just found other brands to promote.\nThe Klipsch RP-600M loudspeakers ($769.00/pair) benefit from some trickle down technology borrowed from its more expensive siblings in the Heritage line-up, and it\u2019s ironic that audiophiles who swore for the past few decades that they would never be caught dead with a pair of Klipsch are lining up to buy them now. Apparently, there is something to the Klipsch sound that people really like.\nAt their asking price, the RP-600M are not without some level of compromise; using the wrong amplifier and not paying attention to set-up affects their performance just enough to make them an exciting listen at first, but not very fulfilling over the long haul. Getting things right with the Klipsch RP-600M from the very beginning will change how you perceive your music collection for many years to come.\nMusic has a presence that few loudspeakers priced below $1,000 can really match; competing products from Quad, Wharfedale, Polk Audio, PSB, KEF, and Paradigm all do a very fine job with all kinds of music, and offer a well-rounded presentation \u2013 but they don\u2019t have the swagger of the RP-600M. Some might find the RP-600M to be too much of a good thing, but they are probably using the wrong amplifier if that\u2019s the case.\nKlipsch loudspeakers have a reputation for being forward/bright sounding, and while there is certainly a lot of top end energy and detail emanating out of the RP-600M\u2019s 1-inch titanium-dome tweeter with hybrid cross-section Tractrix horn, the loudspeaker never really crosses that line. If anything, the RP-600M are the most laid-back sounding pair of Klipsch loudspeakers that I have heard over the past 25 years.\nHorns, in particular, have a healthy degree of bite and tone making them a vibrant listen with great jazz recordings like Hank Mobley\u2019sWorkout(Tidal/MQA) and Donald\u2019s ByrdA New Perspective (Tidal/16-bit/44.1 kHz). Byrd\u2019s signature track \u201cCristo Redentor\u201d had me a little nervous leading up to the moment where his trumpet enters, but the combination of the RP-600M along with a number of warmer sounding amplifiers from Schiit Audio, Heed, Cambridge Audio, and AmpsandSound retained all of the magic without a loss of detail.\nThe RP-600M\u2019s 6.5-inch Cerametallic cone woofer does an admirable job with vocals but nobody will ever confuse it for a paper or polypropylene driver; there was a slight hardness on some recordings like Sam Cooke\u2019sNight Beat(Tidal/16-bit/44.1 kHz) that I have never heard when playing tracks like \u201cLost and Lookin\u2019\u201d though the Quad S-2, PSB Alpha P5, or Wharfedale Diamond 10.1s.\nSwitching over to my vinyl copy of the aforementioned album, there was less of an edge in the upper midrange compared to the same tracks when streaming via Tidal, but it\u2019s clear that the Klipsch sacrifice some midrange warmth for a sharper edge, and more immediate sounding presentation. It\u2019s not a bad thing if you can balance it out with an amplifier or sources that dial back the RP-600M\u2019s exuberance \u2013 but it\u2019s clearly there.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a bass heavy two-way loudspeaker, the Klipsch RP-600M get you part of the way there \u2013 but not completely. Having spent time recently with the Forte III, and La Scala II, I\u2019ve noticed a bit of a trend with Klipsch loudspeakers and bass response. If you\u2019re looking for subterranean bass response that will rattle your walls, the RP-600M are going to leave you hanging somewhat; what you get instead is quick, tuneful bass that is somewhat on the lean side depending on your choice of amplifier.\nListening to Aphex Twin\u2019s \u201cTo Cure a Weakling Child\u201d (Tidal, 16-bit/44.1 kHz) made it pretty clear that the RP-600M are very adept with electronica; the track energized my 16 x 13 x 9 den with relatively tight bass that was fairly extended, but there is no question that it could have benefitted from a subwoofer.\nIf you can pull them 2-3\u2019 from the front wall, they do a reasonable job recreating the space between you and the musicians, but there is trade-off in tonal balance and bass response. Because they are rear ported, I left them 26\u201d from the wall and that proved to be a good compromise in my listening space; the RP-600M sounded fuller to my ears pointed straight ahead and 72\u201d apart.\nAnother positive was their overall appearance, which earned a lot of positive comments from both family and friends who walked past them during the review process. Most people didn\u2019t believe the price and were not turned off by their size (15.7\u201d H by 8\u2033 W by 11.9\u2033 D). The magnetically attached grill covers reduce the overall output by 1dB and there is no question that they impart a tiny veil over the sound. The RP-600M do require robust loudspeaker stands if you really want to pull every last bit of performance out of them.\nThe RP-600M are efficient, high-sensitivity loudspeakers but Klipsch\u2019s claim of 96dB/W/m is not something that I was able to verify. Every amplifier will make the RP-600M sound different; low-powered tube amplifiers carved out the best sound, but 25-50 watts from the right amplifier will be more than you ever need.\nThe RP-600 are above average in the imaging department, but don\u2019t expect them to reproduce a palpable, three-dimensional soundstage in your room.\nThere is a slight level of hardness in the upper midrange that may bother some people with vocals depending on your amplifier. If you stick with warmer sounding amplifiers or sources, the issue will probably never rear its ugly head; and you\u2019ll think they have unbelievable presence.\nAt $769, the Klipsch RP-600M are capable of over-achieving with the right electronics. Drive them with a cheap receiver, or even expensive analytical sounding amplifier and you will find very little joy with them.\nConnecting them to something like the Schiit Audio Aegir or Ragnarok 2,Heed Elixir,or any robust sounding EL34/EL84 tube amplifier will be a match in sonic heaven and end the argument that inexpensive loudspeakers can\u2019t move you emotionally.

        "title": "Nine Affordable Phono Cartridges to Upgrade Your Sound",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/nine-affordable-phono-cartridges/",
        "content": "Vinyl finds itself at an unexpected crossroads in 2022; a new generation of listeners has turned the format into a billion dollar industry again and there are not enough phono cartridges in stock to satisfy global demand. Streaming might be 85% of the market but phono cartridges are one of the hottest categories right now and that caught some with their pants down. Our picks for best affordable phono cartridges are all proven winners and compatible with a wide range of tonearms.\nAmericans bought a lot of new records in 2021.41.7 millionLPs according to the folks at MRC Data. That\u2019s an increase of 51.4% year over year and the first time vinyl records have outsold CDs since 1991. Phono cartridge manufacturers are struggling to keep up with demand.\nIf you are in the market for anaffordable audiophile turntable, or replacement cartridge, it\u2019s easy to get lost looking through the hundreds of affordable phono cartridges that are available. Deciding if you want a moving coil or moving magnet (or moving iron if select one from Grado Labs) cartridge is just one part of the decision making process.\nCompatibility with the tonearm is also something that you need to pay attention to; just because you want to mount a specific cartridge on yourturntabledoesn\u2019t mean that you should without checking with the manufacturer or dealer for advice.\nMany entry-level turntables come with a pre-installed cartridge from Audio-Technica, Grado Labs, Sumiko, or Ortofon. Aside from confirming the tracking weight and that the anti-skate is properly set, you\u2019re usually only a few minutes from listening to records in this scenario.\nBut if you\u2019re looking to upgrade what you already own or don\u2019t love the sound from the pre-installed cartridge on your new table, these are very worthy alternatives and excellent value for the money.\nBut if you want to elevate the level of playback quality from your records, there are a number of options below $750 that extract a lot more information from the grooves and help shape the tonal presentation of the music.\nYour choice ofphono pre-amplifierwill also impact the overall sound quality in a significant way.\nDo not spend more on the cartridge than the table. A better turntable with the right arm will maximize sound quality with even an inexpensive moving magnet cartridge like a Nagaoka MP-110 \u2013 versus a $750 Dynavector on an entry-level turntable.\nProper set-up of your cartridge is more important than what you spend. Clean your records and your stylus. Nothing ruins a stylus faster than dirty records.\nJapanese manufacturer, Nagaoka, has been manufacturing outstanding moving magnet phono cartridges for almost 70 years. The entry-level MP-110 is an excellent tracker digging into worn out grooves with authority and delivers a very open and detailed sounding presentation across the entire frequency spectrum. The 5mV output is on the high side, but that also makes it compatible with a wide range of phono pre-amplifiers.\nThe cartridge is a good match on both entry-level and more expensive turntables and offers a lot of performance in a Rega, Pro-Ject, or SME tonearm for under $130. It may not be as popular as the 2M Red from Ortofon which shows up pre-installed on a lot of entry-level tables, but it offers a smoother ride and with less top end bite.\nFor more information:www.nagaoka.eu\nWhere to buy:$145 at Amazon|Turntable Lab\nLooking through their extensive lineup of phono cartridges can be somewhat confusing, but Audio-Technica have some really affordable cartridges below $200 that really shine on a better table. Install on something entry-level, and the sound will be fine but nothing really special considering how much potential lurks inside the cartridge body. But which one should you buy and do they really sound all that different? Not only do they sound different, but the type and shape of the stylus will have a huge impact on the sound. Even at this price level.\nThe AT-VM95ML is a moving magnet cartridge with a microlinear stylus and rather quiet in the grooves. The 3.5mV output makes it compatible with most internal phono preamps that you\u2019ll find in your receiver or integrated amplifier, and it has excellent channel separation. It\u2019s not the warmest cartridge that we\u2019ve ever heard so pair it with a warm sounding phono preamp or amplifier. Detail freaks will love this cart. Bass freaks will find it somewhat lean and quick sounding in the lower registers. It\u2019s a clean sounding cart that has a little more emphasis in the treble than the Sumiko Moonstone.\nFor more information:www.audio-technica.com/en-us/at-vm95ml\nWhere to buy:$169 at Amazon|Turntable Lab\nSome cartridges fly under the radar because the brand doesn\u2019t get them into the hands of enough members of the press or because the price doesn\u2019t create enough buzz in comparison to rivals. Goldring have been in business almost as long as Danish rival, Ortofon, and that puts them in rather elite company.\nThe Goldring E Series are natural rivals to anything Audio-Technica and Ortofon have to offer below $180 and the E3 might best them all. I\u2019ve been listening for the past two weeks (the E3 replaced both the Ortofon 2M Red on my NAD table) and it\u2019s not even close.\nThe E3 has an aluminum cantilever with an elliptical tip (0.3 x 0.7mil) while the base E1 model swaps the aluminum for carbon reinforced ABS and the tip for a 0.6mil spherical design.\nThe E3 is impressively clean sounding at the price, with excellent pace and just enough top end energy to keep things interesting. Unlike the 2M Red that can sound quite etched at the top, the Goldring E3 is far more balanced sounding and demonstrates better control within the grooves. This is an affordable MM cartridge that sounds quite poised with all genres of music and one that has permanently replaced the Ortofon 2M Red on my table.\nRead our full reviewof the Goldring E3 MM Phono Cartridge.\nFor more information:goldring.co.uk/goldring-e3.html\nWhere to buy:$169 at Amazon\nDenon introduced theDL-103in 1962 for professional broadcast use, and it has proven to be of the most popular and reliable phono cartridges of its kind. The low output moving coil design (0.3mV) requires a higher mass tonearm; opening the door to used Fidelity Research, SME, or EMT arms or more expensive modern arms from Kuzma, or Jelco (which recently decided to cease production). Jazz listeners have long prized the DL-103\u2019s tonal balance and open presentation that make both brass instruments and vocals come alive.\nThe DL-103 requires at least 60dB of gain to come alive; sticking a step-up transformer between the affordable DL-103 and the moving magnet input of your phono stage can be a transformative experience when everything is set-up correctly. Third party manufacturers have been offering modified DL-103 variants for the past few years at considerable expense, but our advice would be to stick with the stock model from Denon.\nFor more information:denon.com/en-us/product/turntables/dl-103\nWhere to buy:$349 at Amazon|Turntable Lab|Denon.com\nSumiko offers an extensive lineup of both moving coil and moving magnet cartridges; a number of models come pre-installed on Pro-Ject tables being distributed in North America and there is a lot to like about the Moonstone at under $300. This 3mV moving magnet cartridge is in the middle of the range and possibly the smoothest sounding of the bunch. The Moonstone has excellent channel separation and tracks exceptionally well.\nHow does it compare to the other cartridges in this survey? It\u2019s certainly smoother sounding than the Audio-Technica, but that comes at the expense of some detail in the treble and it doesn\u2019t create a huge soundstage like the Dynavector or Hana. Out of the box, it\u2019s a tad polite but that changes for the better after about 20-30 hours of use. Clarity, refinement, and a punchy low-end describes the Moonstone rather well. Do not use this cart with overly warm sounding phono preamps \u2014 way too much of a good thing.\nFor more information:sumikophonocartridges.com/product/moonstone-mm-phono-cartridge/\nWhere to buy:$299 at Amazon|Turntable Lab\nHana\u2019s parent company has been an OEM manufacturer for a number of prestigious Japanese phono cartridge brands for years, but the decision to enter the marketplace with their own cartridges under the \u201cHana\u201d label has been a huge success so far. Hana offers three tiers of phono cartridges; creating some welcome competition for Ortofon, Grado, and Audio-Technica, and it is the low-output EL (0.5mV) utilizing an elliptical stylus that shines the brightest with a quality moving coil phono pre-amplifier.\nAn excellent tracker, the EL offers a lush sounding midrange, and slightly rolled-off treble making it an excellent cartridge with a wide range of music and systems. Partnered with a phono pre-amplifier from iFi Audio or Moon by SimAudio, the Hana EL can deliver a lot of performance for only $475.\nFor more information:musicalsurroundings.com/products/hana-el-mc-cartridge\nWhere to buy:$475 at Amazon|Turntable Lab\nA century of cartridge development expertise and manufacturing has to count for something so it\u2019s not surprising to see at least one cartridge from the Danish manufacturer on our list. Ortofon offers a wide range of cartridges from under $100 to almost $10,500 for the Anna MC cartridge, but our favorite affordable model from their line-up is the 2M Bronze. The 2M Red comes pre-installed on a lot of entry-level turntables but we think the additional $375 is well worth it for a lot of reasons. The 5mV output makes it compatible with almost every available external phono pre-amplifier and integrated amplifier, and it\u2019s extremely easy to install \u2013 although those who are thinking about installing it on a Rega tonearm will require spacers to achieve the correct set-up height.\nThe 2M Bronze delivers tonal accuracy, pace, and a boldness that love with tube pre-amplifiers or warming sounding systems. Imaging is excellent, and the top end is far smoother sounding than the 2M Red. We\u2019ve long believed that a better table is more important than spending a fortune on a cartridge and the 2M Bronze is a decided overachiever on expensive turntables. You may listen and decide that your records have never sounded any better.\nFor more information:www.ortofon.com/ortofon-2m-bronze-p-325-n-1579\nWhere to buy:$419 at Audio Advice|Amazon|Turntable Lab\nGrado Labs has been designing and manufacturing its award-winning moving iron cartridges in the same Brooklyn facility for more than 40 years, and this family-owned business rarely changes its designs unless the improvements are going to be significant. The Timbre Series Sonata3 moving iron cartridge housed in an Australian Jarrah wood chassis may be one the best from the venerable brand for under $600.\nThe 4.0mV output makes it compatible with a wide range of phono pre-amplifiers and it\u2019s almost impossible to not pick-up on the Grado house sound; extended dynamics, low end punch, and a warm tonal balance that is highly addictive. The new Timbre models are quieter than the previous models with improved levels of detail. The wood body Grado cartridges sound particularly robust on VPI and Clearaudio turntables.\nFor more information:gradolabs.com/cartridges/timbre-series/item/121-sonata3\nWhere to buy:$600 at 4OurEars(Official Grado Store)\nDynavector has offered this high output moving coil cartridge (2.5mV) for more than 20 years, and while not inexpensive, the 10\u00d75 Mk2 may be the best overall cartridge of its kind with superb tracking, a balanced presentation, and excellent dynamics making it a great choice for jazz listeners. Installation used to be a tad cumbersome, but that issue has been resolved with some minor changes to the headshell.\nThe 10\u00d75 Mk2 may not be the \u201cbest\u201d at anything, but it has earned its reputation as a workhorse cartridge that manages to survive expensive table and tonearm upgrades. Vocals and brass have impressive presence, and there is a synergy between the 10\u00d75 Mk2 and tube phono pre-amplifiers that makes it a final destination for many.\nFor more information:www.dynavector.com/products/cart/e_10x5mk2.html\nWhere to buy:$750 at MusicDirect\nRelated reading:Best Budget Phono Cartridges Below $300\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission."

        "title": "EMT 927: The Holy Grail of Broadcast Turntables",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/emt-927-the-holy-grail-of-broadcast-turntables/",
        "content": "Massive, industrial, monochromatic, and most of all outright intimidating, the EMT 927 doesn\u2019t look like most coveted vintage hi-fi turntables. Entirely stripped of the delicate wood finishes and sleek design efforts that often define quality gear, the 927 seems built to withstand a firefight, with a tank-like appearance cast straight out of a prewar industrial Germany.\nAesthetics, however, were far from the developers\u2019 intentions. Quite literally built to be indestructible, the 927\u2019s were designed in cooperation with the \u2018Rundfunktechnisches Institut\u2019 (Broadcasting Technique Institute) directed by Walter Kuhl. With Kuhl at the helm, the EMT team set out to create a \u2018large studio turntable\u2019 that could be used 24/7/365 in a professional radio broadcast setting.\nThe need for it to blend with home furnishing with striking design \u2013 or even look merely presentable \u2013 wasn\u2019t in its DNA. Seventy years later Kuhl would be stunned to discover that this turntable now nests primarily as the center fixture of some of the best home systems and is one of the most desirable vintage HiFi tables on the market.\nAgain, quality, not appearance: These were the principles upon which Elektromesstechnik was founded. Created in 1938 by Wilhelm Franz in Berlin, EMT was established with a sole purpose: to produce elite and affordable broadcast technology. And from 1951 to the late \u201980s, just before they embraced the digital playback era, the company produced what is considered the most outstanding 16-inch turntable ever built. Their first born was this, the monolithic 927.\nSitting in an all-aluminum skeletal chassis, the 927 measures at a whopping 67.5 x 52 x 21.5 cm and weighs the same as a baby rhino (approximately 80-plus pounds). Above its exposed innards is a hefty and absurdly oversized 44 cm platter (roughly 17 inches). At the time, a 16-inch turntable was necessary for broadcasting stations of the 1930s through the 1950s to play 16-inch transcription discs, mainly containing soap operas that were a mainstay of the world-leading radio networks.\nNext to the platter sits a 12\u201d Ortofon (or EMT) tonearm, all resting on a hammer-tone face that\u2019s\u00a0 fitted with military-grade switches, levers, knobs, and a lifter so smooth you can feel the movement. The platter sits on a ridiculous ball bearing with a shaft that\u2019s 16.6 cm long and has a diameter of 2 cm (!). The most significant component in the assembly is, of course, its motor. On paper it seems more suited for some kind of engine than a turntable. It comes in either 50 hertz or 60 hertz, measuring 13.5 cm in diameter and 20 cm long.\nA precision manufactured three-step pulley is mounted on the motor axis, and a precision idler transfers the power from the motor to the inside rim of the platter. The 927\u2019s idler drive is so detailed that it\u2019s said to guarantee the most competent bass and ensure that the music keeps its most accurate pace, a quality most frequently mentioned when compared to Gerarrd turntables. Many say that because of this, the music being played, with all of its variables and instruments, is recreated in its complete totality and flows the most effortlessly forward.Its unique motor brake also allows for fine adjustment of the speed, about +/-10% adjustment. It can, literally, dead-stop a record playing at 78 rpm (!).\nEMT followed up the 927 with the 930, which has just a little less of everything \u2013 a more economical turntable developed to reach more stations and studios.\nSoundwise, it\u2019s tough to express the superlative ability of this complex machine. Like with all playback, it can never fully reproduce source music; it will always be a reproduction, slightly altered, a shadow version of the original sounds. However, this is where the 927 exceeds that expectation. Due to its robust, muscular, and legendary build quality, it produces a sound that\u2019s\u00a0 precise, immense, and effortless. These uncommonly large puzzle pieces come together to create an unmatched stability that lends itself to a more authoritative and authentic sound presentation.\nThis, in essence, is why so many HiFi forums have subject lines that ask why no other turntable beats the EMT 927. It\u2019s also commonly listed atop answers to the question, \u201cWhat is the best turntable ever?\u201dTo hear it is to believe it. But, unfortunately, as with all great gear, getting your hands on one will make too deep a dent in anyone\u2019s savings. But keep your fingers crossed at the next showroom (like we are).Until then, here is a video that will paint a miniature musical portrait of this holy grail machine."

        "content": "Most people love the idea of a pair of floor standing loudspeakers in their living room or den, but domestic concerns often put a serious dent in that plan. There\u2019s also the issue of cost; consumers don\u2019t necessarily want to spend thousands of dollars on speakers and the truth is that the quality of bookshelf or stand-mounted loudspeakers in 2021 has never been better.\nThe idea that you have to accept mediocre sound quality if you can only afford to spend $500 for a pair of speakers is completely false. Let\u2019s put that nonsense to bed.\nGetting more for less now means that you can spend more on a better amplifier or network streamer or turntable to go along with your new loudspeakers. Building a great sounding hi-fi system on a budget below $3,000 is actually the new normal and don\u2019t let anyone shame you into thinking you\u2019re not an audiophile if that\u2019s where you need to start.\nNever judge a pair of speakers by its grille covers or its price. The Paradigm Monitor SE Atom will not impress with their boxy and somewhat austere appearance \u2013 and that\u2019s exactly why you need to give these overachieving two-way bookshelf loudspeakers a serious listen. Where the rubber meets the road with these loudspeakers is when you remove the grille covers and discover that Paradigm is spoiling you with a scaled-down version of their X-Pal perforated phase-aligned tweeter and a robust 5 \u00bd\u201d mid-bass driver that belongs on loudspeakers that are double the price. The Monitor SE Atom are relatively easy to drive but take a significant step forward if you reward them with power. Tubes or warm sounding solid-state is the way to go if you want to hear what these loudspeakers can do.$318/pair at Amazon.\nThe updated 3030i is larger than its predecessor, featuring a new crossover, reinforced internal bracing, as well as recessed binding posts for those who may want to wall-mount or set-up close to the wall. Q Acoustics have gone the extra mile with the finish options as well; the English Walnut, Graphite Grey and Arctic White give the 3030i a modern look that belies its price. The 3030i are not particularly difficult to drive but they benefit from some power; its 6.5\u201d mid/bass driver is capable of excellent bass extension with the right amplifier. The 1\u201d soft-dome tweeter (taken from the more expensive 3050i) balances out the warm tonal balance, and slightly recessed presentation of the speaker with some needed bite. Pair these up with an integrated amplifier fromNADor Cambridge Audio and you\u2019ll be in sonic heaven.$399/pair at Amazon.\nRead ourQ Acoustics 3030i Review.\nGet system recommendations in ourQ Acoustics 3030i: Audiophile System Builder.\nFor almost forty years, Paul Barton has been engineering high-performance loudspeakers with a focus on value/performance. TheAlpha P5are small two-way bookshelf loudspeakers at a price point with a lot of competition \u2013 a scenario that makes it hard for products to differentiate themselves enough to be considered category leaders. Make no mistake, the Alpha P5 are remarkable loudspeakers with even modest amplification, but they blow past anything in their price range with a better amplifier with wonderful resolution, tonal accuracy, and a very dynamic presentation that makes them a solid long-term purchase for anyone who loves music.$399/pair at Amazon.\nSee ourPSB Alpha P5 review.\nThe Wharfedale Diamond 12.1\u2019s are the ideal size for a desktop loudspeaker or placement on a credenza in a home office scenario. These stand-mounters are a two-way, bass-reflex\u00a0design. The\u00a05-inch mid/bass driver\u00a0uses a polypropylene/mica composite cone material, and the tweeter is a 1-inch textile dome design that offers a very smooth sounding top end and excellent dispersion. Coherency and detail are both excellent, and we were pleased to hear that they don\u2019t make excuses for poor recordings. Feed them garbage and you\u2019ll know it. Bass response is surprisingly robust to a point; hence the reason why I\u2019m suggesting a subwoofer in this scenario. The Wharfedale Diamond 12.1\u2019s can deliver a punch \u2013 just not a knock-out blow. They work amazingly well with theNAD C316BEE V2integrated amplifier.$399/pair at Amazon\nSee ourWharfedale Diamond 12.1 review.\nGet system recommendations in ourWharfedale Diamond 12.1 Audiophile System Builder.\nThe KEF Q350 bookshelf loudspeaker looks and sounds very little like its predecessor; thanks to the next generation of its Uni-Q driver technology with its tangerine waveguide on the tweeter which helps the concentric driver direct sound more evenly. The sleek minimalist design dispenses with everything but a clean looking baffle and is only available in either satin white or black. The Q350 are rear ported and require some space between them and the wall to retain their open presentation, while benefiting from boundary reinforcement. They are slightly more reserved sounding than some of their competitors, but they reproduce music with a greater sense of scale and coherency that is hard to resist.$699/pair at Amazon.\nTheRP-600Mhave been a huge success story for Klipsch and helped renew interest in their more expensive Heritage-series loudspeakers at the same time. Despite their reputation for being forward/bright sounding, the RP-600M\u2019s 1-inch titanium-dome tweeter with hybrid cross-section Tractrix horn never crosses a line that makes them sound etched or bright. Horns have ample detail, and it is their overall presence and strong dynamic capabilities that makes these speakers such an engaging listen. The RP-600M are a large set of bookshelf loudspeakers that require proper stands. While not bass monsters, the RP-600M are incredibly easy to drive and benefit from warmer sounding amplifiers.Was $729/pair.Check pricing at Amazon,CrutchfieldorKlipsch.com.\nSee ourKlipsch RP-600M review.\nGet system recommendations in ourRP-600M Audiophile System Builder.\nB&W prolonged the lifespan of the award-winning 685 S2 bookshelf loudspeakers before introducing the 606, but the wait was certainly worth it. A truly engaging pair of loudspeakers designed for both stand or media console placement, the 606 deliver a taste of B&W\u2019s more expensive Continuum cone technology which is usually reserved for its more expensive models. Its 6.5\u201d midrange/bass driver can deliver deep, tight bass that is well balanced against the rest of the sonic spectrum. The lively sounding tweeter will never fail to retain your attention, but don\u2019t get the impression that these loudspeakers are bright sounding. They are engaging and very balanced sounding.\n$899.99/pair at AudioAdvice.comandbowerswilkins.com.\nSonus faber has been manufacturing loudspeakers in Italy for almost four decades (2023 will be its 40thanniversary), and the luxury brand started by the late-Franco Serblin has preserved its reputation for manufacturing the world\u2019s most beautiful loudspeakers with great skill. Sonus faber\u2019s loudspeakers are aspirational products for many audiophiles for both their visual appeal and acoustic capabilities. The Sonus faber Lumina 1 continue that tradition at a much more affordable price.\nOne of the most unique design aspects of early Sonus faber designs was the use of leather on the front baffle; a detail the Lumina I forgo for a leather-wrapped enclosure instead that looks especially striking with the Wenge-finished (real wood veneer) multilayer front baffle. The Lumina collection are available in Walnut, Piano Black, and Wenge \u2013 the magnetic grille covers should be left in the box for both sonic and aesthetic reasons. There are two sets of binding posts on the rear panel for bi-wiring or bi-amping.\nRead ourSonus faber Lumina I Review.\nGet system suggestions in ourLumina I Audiophile System Builder.\nTheChora 806are part of larger group of affordable loudspeakers from Focal that have instant appeal; they are well made, modern and clean looking, and the sound quality is excellent for the asking price. The Chora 806 are front-ported two-way bookshelf speakers that can be set-up close to the wall on a media unit or credenza if that reality applies to you and your room. The Chora 806 offers a really pleasant balance in the upper frequencies and I doubt too many will find the loudspeaker to be hyperdetailed or bright sounding at all. You get all of the extension and detail that you need and nothing more.$990 at Crutchfield.\nSee ourFocal Chora 806 review.\nThe first things you notice about the affordable EVO4.2 are their size and weight; very few bookshelf speakers are 30 pounds and 18\u201d tall. The robustness of their construction translates to their sound quality as well. Wharfedale has built a full-range sounding loudspeaker with layers of resolution, a laid-back sounding presentation that makes it compatible with a wider range of equipment, and an exceptionally airy sounding top end that you rarely find in loudspeakers below $2,000. The overall coherency and midrange transparency make the EVO4.2 one of the best sounding and affordable bookshelf speakers you can find. The one caveat would be the need for heavy-duty loudspeaker stands between 18\u201d-22\u201d to place the tweeter at the right listening height.$999.99 at Crutchfield.\nPolk Audio have been manufacturing loudspeakers for over 40 years, and the L100 might be one of their crown achievements. Unless your listening room is cavernous, the L100 might be one of the best sounding full-range bookshelf speakers we have come across in many years; they do require a lot of power to show off their capabilities and we would suggest 75-100 watts of power (not A/V receiver watts) as the bare minimum. The L100 utilize Polk\u2019s 1\u201d ring radiator tweeter, and 5 \u00bc\u201d turbine cone midrange/bass driver with great sonic results. This is a bold and accurate sounding loudspeaker with a warm midrange and a lot of detail.$999.99/pair at Crutchfield.\nSee ourPolk Audio Legend L100 Review.\nLearn what components pair well in ourPolk L100 Audiophile System Builder.\nELAC\u2019s Andrew Jones has a remarkable track record of designing both price-no-object and entry-level bookshelf speakers that deliver the sonic goods. It is his affordable offerings, however, that continue to inspire delivering sound quality that few designers have proven capable of squeezing out of two-way bookshelf designs priced below $1,500. The Carina BS243.4 raise the bar with its JET folded ribbon tweeter, and 5 \u00bc\u201d aluminum cone mid/bass driver that can energize a room and create an enormous sounding soundstage when set-up properly. The Carina can sound a tad dry with the wrong amplification; tubes are a great option with these sleek looking loudspeakers which do require some power to open up.$1,379.98 at Amazon.com.\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission."

        "content": "Not all vintage buys are wins. I hate to burst that bubble with this week\u2019s installment, but it needs to be said. Now that I\u2019ve had a few years to try a lot of vintage equipment, restore it, and experiment with a lot of amplifiers, turntables, CD players, and loudspeakers \u2013 I\u2019ve discovered more than a few dogs along the way. None of that diminishes the excitement I get from the equipment that has taken up permanent residence in my systems at home, but reality bites sometimes.\nTwo companies that have\u00a0recently\u00a0struck my interest areDynacoandHeathkit;\u00a0specifically their\u00a0homebuilt\u00a0kits which to some degree you can still buy. DIY amps, receivers, and audio scopes\u00a0were not\u00a0uncommon in the 1960s and\u00a01970s. There is certainly a cult of people in the vintage audio community who love both brands; I\u2019ve noticed that a number of high-end audio dealers have a constant flow of Dynaco ST-70 power amplifiers available for sale at really high prices so there must be some demand for it.\nHeathkit and Dynaco sold products that\u00a0featured quality components, detailed instructions and could be completed over the course of a few days with decent soldering skills and patience.\nThe products were available factory-assembled,\u00a0but what made all of these specific\u00a0pieces unique was that they were mostly assembled by hobbyists. Some of these people were quite skilled and knew what they were doing. The finished product could be excellent, or really terrible if the person made serious mistakes.\nThis week, I\u2019m going to dig a little deeper into my own personal experience with two Dynaco and two Heathkit models that I purchased. The results varied from excellent to horrific nightmare worse than the 4 consecutive Super Bowl losses by my beloved Buffalo Bills in the 1990s.\nDamn you Scotty Norwood.\nDynaco was formed in\u00a01955\u00a0by Ed Laurent and David Hafler\u00a0in Philadelphia, and the brand quickly became popular for its affordable and wide range of audio components. The ST-70 stereo tube amplifier was its most popular component; Dynaco sold more than 350,000 units before the brand was liquidated in 1980.\nDavid Hafler had become popular in the Hi-Fi world in the 1950s with his brand,Acrosound. The company had developed high-quality output transformers for use with DIY home electronics and when Hafler moved on and formed the new company with Laurent, they realized that there was a big market for build-it-yourself kits.\nTheStereo 70(ST-70)\u00a0was\u00a0Introduced in 1959 and\u00a0was available as a kit (Dynakit) intended for assembly by the purchaser or as a complete factory-wired unit. The ST-70 used\u00a0four\u00a0EL34\u00a0output tubes, one GZ34/5AR4 rectifier tube, two 7199 input (driver) tubes, two output\u00a0transformers, one power transformer, and a preassembled\u00a0printed circuit board\u00a0(PCB) containing the driver circuit.\u00a0The power output was 35 watts/channel.\nMy journey with the ST-70 started off without a lot of drama; my wife located one that was for sale at a record store in Vermont and we made the trip for New York to take a look. What gave me confidence was that it was the personal unit of the shop owner and he knew everything about it and it\u2019s always reassuring to have the history of a piece of vintage audio equipment before you open up the wallet.\nAfter we agreed on a price, he packed it up really well for our journey back to Buffalo, where it now resides at the home of our neighbor. He has helped me with a number of vintage audio projects, and it seemed like the best way for both of us to enjoy the product. The vintage audio community really has a different attitude in regard to trying products out.\nSince\u00a0the\u00a0purchase,\u00a0the RCA plugs have be updated and the small hum it\u00a0developed\u00a0was remedied by placing it on a book or some vibration isolators.\u00a0DIY indeed.\nThe 35 watts/channel power rating gives one some latitude with loudspeakers; I\u2019ve mated it successfully with every bookshelf loudspeaker I\u2019ve tried with it and it\u2019s a workhorse of an amplifier.\nThe overall tonal balance is quite warm, and I love the powerful presentation that it can deliver with the right pair of loudspeakers. The EL34 is one of my favorite output tubes; for both its tone and the availability of tubes (both new and NOS) from dealers online.\nI can recommend the\u00a0ST-70\u00a0with the\u00a0one\u00a0caveat that you\u00a0really need to\u00a0understand the owner/builder and learn as much history as you can about the specific sample that you find. None of the tubes are very expensive to replace, but you don\u2019t want to get into the business of buying new output transformers when you\u2019re spending a decent amount of money on this kind of amplifier.\nParts are readily available from a number of online dealers so you\u2019re never going to be left out in the woods with the ST-70. The amplifier is a really a great looking piece of equipment and an iconic piece of audio equipment.\nAnother Dynaco amplifier that I purchased was the STA-120. It has a similar case like the ST-70, but that\u2019s where the similarities end. The STA-120 is a 60 watts/channel solid state amplifier, which was rather powerful for the period. I had read numerous very positive reviews of this amplifier, so I made the decision to purchase one without any hesitation.\nWhen I got home and connected the amplifier to the rest of my system, I was somewhat shocked by the differences between the two amplifiers. I was very puzzled by its sonic presentation; cold and distant and nothing changed when I increased the volume level.\nI wondered if I had created a mismatch between the power amplifier and the pre-amp, so I began trying other preamplifiers and loudspeakers. Nothing improved. In some cases, the changes made the amplifier sound even worse, and I could barely get through a few songs before turning everything off.\nI conducted a more thorough examination of the amplifier and did some more research online. What I discovered made me feel that I had wasted money on an amplifier that could be restored and modified with some rather expensive parts but that I was not really listening to a Dynaco STA-120 at that point. This was definitely a huge miss. Not an amplifier that I could recommend.\nHeathkit have been around since the 1920s and are still making kits available for sale.\nThey sold just about every type of electric/electronic kit that you can think of for you to build; their radio kits being the most popular. In the 1960s, they sold tube amplifier kits like the AA-100 which looked and sounded great \u2013 but only if the hobbyist knew what they were doing.\nI found a model AA-21D transistor amplifier and purchased it just because of the industrial design. It reminded me of a \u201860s car dashboard and it was a very clean example.\nWhen it arrived in the mail, I was impressed by the level of packaging. The previous owner clearly wanted it to arrive in perfect working condition and without any dents or new scratches.\nThe power button (hidden behind the logo) was quite clever, and I became very excited to use the amplifier.\nAll the \u201cdashboard lights\u201d came on but that was it. No sound, not even white noise. I opened up the case and checked the usual suspects. I discovered the issue rather quickly. This unit was designed with a handful of self-resetting glass breakers.\nThey were advanced technology a few decades ago (apparently), but every single one was broken inside the unit. I also discovered that replacements were not that easy to locate. The Heathkit has in the repair shop for 6 months. This product earns a \u201cmiss\u201d at this point.\nI was a little depressed after misstep. You want a vintage component to work out but it\u2019s never a good scenario when it\u2019s DOA.\nBut did I swear off Heathkit for life after this disappointing experience?\nNope. I\u2019m a curious type of person and there was another Heathkit product that I really wanted to find.\nAfter seeing an audio scope for the first time, I was hooked. I needed one. The \u201cHoly Grail\u201d of audio scopes is the Pioneer SD-1100; a rare component that is prized for its beautiful silver front faceplate, audio oscilloscope, and VU meters. Anon-functioning sampleof this product fetches more than my audio budget allows.\nMuch to my delight, I discovered the Heathkit Model AD-1013. In a moment of pure madness, I purchased two samples that came with the original build manuals. The price was right, and I hedged my bets that at least one model would work properly with some restoration.\nKarma is a thing. Sharing with others in the community must have earned me some luck because the first unit worked perfectly, and the second unit only required a replacement CRT tube that I was able to source on eBay for a reasonable price.\nThese audio scopes allow you to troubleshoot L/R channels which is extremely helpful when testing vintage equipment. What I use the most is the \u201cstereo\u201d setting which allows you to see (not just hear) the channel separation. It\u2019s neat to see a well-engineered and produced track on the scope \u2014 and easy to see one that isn\u2019t. If you already own or want an audio scope, you need to check out the rather interesting \u201cAudioscope\u201d music being created byJerobeam Fenderson.\nBoth of these brands offer some great value in the vintage audio category, but you really need to do your homework and ask the right questions. The Dynaco ST 70 is a very special audio component that can work in a lot of new systems; not just the vintage variety. Partner this amplifier up with a good pre-amplifier and it delivers so much presence and gestalt with music. If you can find one in perfect shape and you have the right loudspeakers \u2013 a very smart purchase.\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission."

        "title": "The Dual 701 & Yamaha YP-701 Turntables: Exit to Vintage Street",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/dual-701-yamaha-yp-701/",
        "content": "In the early \u201890s I took the digital plunge, and I sold my trusty Technics SL-220 turntable and four milk crates of records. I was moving abroad so this was somewhat of a forced choice, but like many, I also believed the future was digital. The Dual 701 and Yamaha YP-701 were not yet on my radar.\nLittle did I know that vinyl would come storming back 25 years later. I resisted the call to buy a turntable and get back into records, but finally succumbed in September 2018. At this point, I was committedly riding the retro audio train, so the turntable was definitely going to be avintage modelfrom the \u201870s or early \u201880s. I just didn\u2019t know which one. Much to my surprise it became two.\nThe decision to go analog again brought on some serious online research. Being \u201cnew\u201d to vinyl, I didn\u2019t want to spend a lot of money, but very much wanted a reliable turntable that could deliver great sound. On the high-end side I was drawn to models like the Thorens TD-160, Pioneer PL-518, Marantz 6300 and Linn LP12, but my wallet firmly rejected these options. Perhaps someday in the future, but not right now.\nOne brand that consistently popped up in searches as a potential price-to-performance winner was Dual; with plenty of article mentions, and every third or fourth vintage table on eBay and Kijiji being one of their tables. They obviously manufactured a lot of turntables in the \u201870s, and their prevalence was proof of quality and durability.\nDual produced their first turntable in Germany in the late 1930s. They started selling internationally in the late \u201860s with\u00a0their 1009 idler wheel table and added belt and direct-drive players to the product line in the \u201870s. Dual\u2019s best-known units were undoubtedly the 1009, 1219 and 1229 (all idler drives competing with the pricier\u00a0Garrard, Lenco and Thorens tables of the day) and the 701 direct drive.\nI was quite attracted to the design and reported sound quality of the Dual 701, but it was still a bit expensive for my liking. After much research, I settled on a 604 semi-automatic, direct drive for its simple mechanism, low noise, reliability and price. Reports called it one of the more underrated Duals, and I\u2019m a fan of underdogs. A search on Kijiji found one in good, recently serviced condition with a reputable Empire 2000E/iii cartridge. I decided to take the plunge.\nTo get off on the right foot, I also quickly picked up several essential records:Kind of Blue,Aja,New Gold Dream,Avalon,Blue Train,Flight to Jordan,Blade Runner OST,Idle Moments,Wish You Were Here; all great albums with superb sonics.\nTo be honest, I didn\u2019t expect to be so smitten by the entirety of the vinyl experience. On the tactile side, I derived great pleasure from the ritual of interacting with the record and player. Removing the record from the sleeve and placing it gently on the platter, engaging the player and setting down the tonearm, settling in to listen, holding the cover and reading the notes and lyrics, flipping the record part way through \u2014 This sense of musical ceremony was something I\u2019d missed over the preceding 27-odd years of CDs and digital files.\nAnd the ritual element was matched emotionally on the sound side; the warmth and dynamics of analogue \u2013 even the occasional snap, crackle and pop of dust on the record \u2013 touches the soul in a way the purity and perfection of digital never can. Vinyl playback is imperfect. Like real life.\nI found the Dual 604 to be a very satisfying player and was happy with both my turntable choice and the immersion back into vinyl. Fast forward a few months and we moved from condo to house. Suddenly I had two systems in different parts of the house. Initially the upstairs, living room system consisted of just amp, speakers and an Apple AirPort Express for wireless play from my laptop. The main system had turntable, CD player and wireless sources, but soon enough I wanted a second table for the living room, too.\nMy interest in the Dual 701 had only grown in the intervening months. Some of my Instagram friends were proud owners, and they regularly encouraged me to pick up \u201cthe best Dual ever made.\u201d I started looking out for one, but price was still a hindrance.\nOne day, shortly before my birthday, an eBay search brought up a new \u201c701\u201d turntable. Not a Dual, but a Yamaha. This wasn\u2019t a turntable I\u2019d heard of before, but it looked beautiful, and I decided to look into it further.\nThe YP-701 (or YP-700, depending on where it was sold) was Yamaha\u2019s top-of-the-line mid- \u201870s turntable. The belt-drive, auto-return player\u00a0is a bit of a monster, measuring 480 x 410 x 161mm (18.9\u201d x 16.1\u201d x 6.3\u201d) and weighing 9.2 kg (just over 20 lbs).\u00a0It features a medium-mass S-shaped tonearm with universal plug-in head shell, heavy die-cast aluminum platter, and double float suspension (arm and turntable are sprung separately from the motor to insulate against vibration and motor noise).\nNo signal is passed until after the stylus is actually on the record, so there is no thud as the needle comes in contact on start-up.\nThe sound of the YP-701 has been compared in reviews with Thorens tables of the same time period, which may be at least partially due to similarities in the suspension design; in fact this model of Yamaha was nicknamed the \u201cpoor man\u2019s Thorens\u201d by some. I decided this would make a great addition to my audio collection, and a great birthday present, and so a purchase was made.\nAs a side note, I\u2019ve since learned that turntable purchases on eBay can be fraught with issues, the most pervasive of which is shipping damage. I got lucky with the YP-701 in that the seller knew what they were doing and shipped with all pieces suitably wrapped and protected, with bomb-proof double boxing and insulation from vibration and impact. Fortunately, the table arrived in perfect condition. If you\u2019re buying a turntable online, always check seller feedback and confirm proper packaging before finalizing a purchase.\nOn arrival, the YP-701 went into rotation in the downstairs listening room, and the Dual 604 moved upstairs to the living room. I was super impressed with the Yamaha from the first few records. The styling is immaculate, and performance was all that I could have hoped for. The independently suspended platter, motor and arm make this a very quiet turntable.\nIt is a delicate sounding player, particularly sweet in the midrange and treble (not surprising for a Japanese table), but some might find the low end a bit thin and lacking in authority. I found (and find) it particularly good with jazz, classical and acoustic music where detail is of the essence. It may not have the thicker midrange of the classicThorens tables like the TD-160 Super and TD-125, but it\u2019s a very capable deck with a good cartridge.\nIn spite of this Yamaha-induced contentment, something still nagged at me. My Dual 701 friends continued to prod me (yes, I\u2019m pointing at you in particular,Chad G), both to get one, and to do a 701 Battle Royale. My Instagram community was rather interested in the Yamaha, so I decided that I needed both.\nEditor-in-Chief, Ian White, who is a huge vintage Thorens user and big proponent of the work performed by New Hampshire-based,Vinyl Nirvana, took a fancy to my trusty YP-701 and made an offer on it that I couldn\u2019t refuse.\nHe\u2019s been running it with aNagaoka MP-110andDenon DL-A110and has had nothing but praise so far for it. He did have one minor setup issue because I forgot to mention removing the motor cover to install the belt.\nThe Dual 701 (1973-76) is a table of pure simplicity, with platter sitting directly on top of an innovative,\u00a0electronic, low speed motor with feedback-controlled speed precision. The 701\u2019s motor is so quiet and resonance-free that it does not require isolation mounting and is attached directly to the table\u2019s chassis. At the time of production, it was considered to be the \u201cquietest turntable ever made,\u201d as evaluated in independent laboratory tests.\nEverything I read and learned from owners online, convinced me that I needed this Dual. Then on the last day of 2019, there was a new Kijiji listing for a Dual 701. Original owner. With Shure V15iii cartridge. In Calgary. Just 30 minutes from my house. And the price was about half of what I\u2019d become accustomed to seeing in other ads. No time for thinking. The call was made, and I was on my way to check it out.\nSome days \u2013 you just get lucky. Like hit the jackpot lucky.\nThe seller was definitely a lover of music. An older gentleman, downsizing before moving into a senior\u2019s home. He\u2019d sold off most of his system, and the Dual was the last piece to go. Aside from a little wear on the plinth, it was in wonderful condition. I could sense his disappointment at this parting, but also felt he was happy it was going to a home where it would be treated for years to come with the same reverence he had for it. A deal was struck, and I ended the year on the ultimate high.\nThe Dual 701 was all I imagined it to be. It features a straight tonearm (common on all vintage Dual tables), shuttle cartridge mounting system, internal grounding (no finicky grounding wire to attach to the amp), a 2.9 kg (6.4 lbs) non-magnetic, dynamically balanced, detachable platter, auto-start and return, stroboscopic pitch control, and a beautiful wood plinth. It has a relatively small footprint at 420 x 362 x 145 mm (16.5\u201d x 14.3\u201d x 5.7\u201d) and weighs a hefty 10.9 kg (24 lbs).\nThe 701 is authoritative and dynamic, with a big, robust tone. The low-end\u00a0is nice and thick; compare it to any inexpensive turntable made overseas today and you\u2019ll hear the difference. The\u00a0midrange is warm and\u00a0fleshed out\u00a0with good detail retrieval. Treble is pleasing and certainly not lacking, though perhaps outshone by the quality of the lower registers.\u00a0The slightly forward presentation and excellent sense of pace make it an excellent choice for any genre of music.\nSo, quest done? Probably not. The Dual 604 was sold soon after the Dual 701 arrived. I\u2019ve since inherited a Technics linear tracking turntable which spends its days as part of the living room system. And I still have a hankering for a Thorens, Linn, or maybe an old Empire. The adventure never ends, but the joy is in the journey and not the destination.\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission."

        "content": "After reading the firsttwo installmentsof my column, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s become obvious that I have a penchant for used and vintage audio. With the exception of a new phono cartridge that I recently added from Audio-Technica, I have never purchased a new piece of home audio equipment. Not ever. We did take the home theater plunge at one point, but the room was not well suited for all of those loudspeakers and we gave it away.\nThat being said, I have sourced used and vintage audio from almost every place imaginable. We\u2019re going to go on a bit of a buying road trip this week in search of audio treasure but also discuss some of the important ground rules when you decide to take this path to audio nirvana.\nVintage and used high-end audio sounds like a really good idea to people; aside from the cost savings (although the prices for some used high-end components can be extremely high), people crave nostalgia. Not all nostalgia is all that it is cracked up to be, however. There are plenty of lemons in the vintage category. You need to do your legwork.\nBefore we hit the road, let\u2019s talk about used audio equipment.\nRemember to use your common sense when purchasing usedelectricalequipment. Always test the equipment if you can, and with a level of knowledge about the product or you\u2019ll end up with an expensive doorstop. Just because it looks expensive, doesn\u2019t mean that the product didn\u2019t suffer a catastrophic malfunction at some point or was dropped during a move.\nDo your research on the component so you know how to test it. If you have no testing skills or desire to learn how to test equipment properly, do not jump when you find a 60 year-old tube amplifier and just plug it into the wall. Older equipment that has not been tested or serviced in decades can be very dangerous.\nEven if you are comfortable and experienced enough to repair your own equipment, these are all things you need to know before agreeing to a transaction.\nUsed orvintage turntablesrequire a lot more investigation and you want to make sure that the following items are addressed before you decide to buy.\nI know this sounds like a lot of items to investigate when buying a used or vintage turntable, but if you have to fix a lot of these items \u2013 it might be cheaper and less frustrating to buy a new one.\nThere are specialist used high-end and vintage audio dealers, but that\u2019s not our focus for this week as we have something special planned for when it\u2019s safer for us to travel. Ecoustics Editor-in-Chief, Ian White, and I will be visiting some local dealers in New York, and New Jersey \u2013 and possibly visiting a factory or two.\nHigh-end audio dealers will almost always have trade-in products but don\u2019t expect too many rare finds that they are giving away.\nOne thing I have to mention before we go any further is that bad pictures and poor product descriptions do not mean that a product is not worth considering.\nBear in mind that a lot of vintage and used equipment has been sitting in basements, garages, attics, and in storage units owned by widows, retirees, and their families. These people might not have any idea what these components are, and they may not consider it important to whip out the DSLR and create photographic montages worthy of Robb Report.\nI\u2019ve purchased some excellent components that were mislabeled as \u201cspeakers\u2019 when it was clearly an amplifier.\nSo where should you look?\nSmart record stores have begun to sell both affordable audio and used/vintage. It only makes sense as they have a captive audience and it\u2019s hard to listen to a record without a turntable.\nNo \u2013 not off the guy who called you names on Twitter.\nInstagram and Facebook Groups have proven to be excellent places to find used audio and vintage pieces from individual sellers. Retailers often post items they are trying to sell quickly, and you may find a bargain.\nGoodwill and other Thrift stores can be a great place to find equipment, but they have become much more aware of the market, especially because of the resurgence of vinyl.\nPeople tend to liquidate equipment when someone passes away or when they decide to empty the basement or garage. You can visit 10 garage sales in a single day and come away empty-handed or visit a single one and discover gold. It\u2019s a lot of luck.\nPro tip: Don\u2019t be the kind of person who takes advantage of someone\u2019s grief or financial situation and give them $50 for an amplifier or loudspeaker they could sell for $200 or even more.Actually be a mensch and do the right thing. If you find a workingMcIntosh amplifieror Thorens TD-125 MKII turntable for $100 \u2013 pay them more or let them know that they should sell it to a collector. Karma is a thing.\nIf a quality piece of equipment is being sold during a garage sale or estate sale \u2013 there is usually something more that might be of interest. Ask!\nI hope this helps starts you on your journey to purchasing vintage audio. As your experience builds, you\u2019ll be more comfortable with the hunt. Do your research, look what others are running, ask how they like it, join and participate inaudiokarma.org. Look at the \u201csold\u201d \u201ccompleted\u201d auctions on eBay to see what market values are. As a beginner, the vintage audio community will always be welcoming and willing to answer questions.\nGood luck.\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission."

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/affordable-vintage-speakers/",
        "content": "A great stereo system, the saying goes, is only as good as its speakers. Spend all you want on amps, speaker wire, and cartridges, but if the rectangular wooden boxes that push out the soundwaves can\u2019t handle the power or lack the clarity, your otherwise immaculately conceived system will be wasted.\nThat\u2019s another way of saying to be prepared to spend more on, and be more finicky when investing in, these essential components than anything else in your system.\nAs with every decision in our capitalist society, you have the option to buy newly manufactured goods or reuse someone else\u2019s (perfectly good, and excellently crafted) used ones. Both have benefits, but the world desperately needs less new stuff and more recycled stuff. Vintage speakers were built to last and are often easily refurbished..\nAs an inspiration on your quest for better speakers, here\u2019s an advisory tip from a veteran hi-fi collector, via the highly recommendedVintage Stereo and Hi-Fi Equipmentgroup on Facebook:\nCheck FB marketplace regularly\u2026..I got KLH6 speakers for $85\u2026.Advent 1s for $100\u2026..Bozaks for $80\u2026. Kenwood 7400 receiver for $100\u2026.Pioneer sx636 for $100\u2026. Philips 212 TT for $75\u2026\u2026Concept 2QD TT for $140\u2026\u2026ELAC Miracord TT for $120\u2026..Point is\u2026..for under $500 you can do pretty well if you want vintage\u2026.all above pieces were in really good cosmetic condition and work as they should.\nAs a follow-up to our recent primer on used amplifiers and receivers, below is a list of quality affordable speaker brands and models to seek from the golden era of hi-fi.\nHistory: Klipsch was born in Arkansas in 1946 by the brilliant inventor Paul A. Klipsch with his unveiling of the historic Klipschorn speaker system, a game-changing creation that harnessed a trio of separate drivers \u2014 woofer, squawker, and tweeter\u2014 to reproduce, respectively, the signal\u2019s bass, midrange, and treble frequencies. Across the following decades, Klipsch introduced an unimpeachable variety of speaker systems based on the inventor\u2019s technology.\nModels: Volumes have been written about various landmark Klipsch models, the consensus being that the best bangs for the buck are the classic Heritage line model the Heresy. Those in the know, though, say that the KG4, which are smaller and less expensive than Heresy speakers, offer sound quality equal to, or even better, than their older siblings. But a quick Google search will offer tons of guidance.\nHistory: Starting in the 1950s, the Boston metropolitan area became home to a number of revolutionary speaker makers. Few were more essential to the hi-fi movement than audio renegade, inventor, writer, and researcher Edgar Villchur and his student, Henry Kloss. Founded in the mid-1950s to produce reasonably-priced high quality speakers. To say they succeeded is an understatement. Along with classic Klipsch speakers, Acoustic Research is considered the Cadillac of manufacturers.\nModels: If you see vintage ARs, buy them on the spot. Their model numbers are easy to parse: AR-1 was the company\u2019s first foray, and across the decades that number increased as its products evolved. The AR-3 is highly coveted, as are AR-10s.\nHistory: Founded by Henry Kloss after he left Acoustic Research, the former protege shared a similar belief: that great fidelity didn\u2019t have to mean high prices. Dubbed, simply, the Advent Loudspeaker, Kloss aimed to equal the quality of sound generated by AR-3s at half the price. He succeeded, to say the least.\nSuggested models: The Advent Loudspeaker (later renamed Larger Advent speakers after the introduction of the equally impressive Smaller Advent model). The company shuttered in the early 1980s, but managed to sell hundreds of thousands of units across the 1970s.\nHistory: Founded in the late 1920s as Altec, it bought James B. Lansing\u2019s speaker company in the early 1940s and eventually became an established seller of theater loudspeakers. Their \u201cVoice of the Theater\u201d line blanketed the country\u2019s movie houses, and the company moved into the home stereo market starting in the 1950s.\nSuggested models: The company is still active but the quality isn\u2019t there. The early models, A-1 through A-5, are huge; the company moved into home entertainment with the AR-7s, which, like the AR-8s, are highly coveted now.\nHistory: Best known for helping advance Sensurround technology in the 1970s, CV was founded by aerospace engineer Eugene J. \u201cGene\u201d Czerwinski in 1954; he made his name after producing an 18-inch speaker able to hit 130 dB at 30 Hz. The company started selling their now desirable \u201cResidential\u201d line of speakers in the 1970s.\nModels: Early models 24 and 26 are historic. Later in the decade, the company perfected\u00a0models A-10 and A-123, while introducing the R-10 (10-inch, 2-way system), R-12 (12-inch, 2-way system), R-123 (12-inch, 3-way system), 12TR (12-inch Tower Reflecting horn), and (per Wikipedia) 15T tower speakers with 12-inch and 15-inch downward firing woofers, and the model S-1 bookshelf speakers.\nHistory: One of the best known speaker brands of the past half-century, JBL remains an industry leader that has evolved as it\u2019s grown. Founded by James B. Lansing (the Lansing of Altec-Lansing) in 1946 after he left Altec-Lansing, JBL continued despite Lansing committing suicide in 1949. It changed ownership several times before its sales skyrocketed in the early 1970s with its home lines.\nSuggested models: The L-100 was the best-selling loudspeaker model of any company up until\u00a0 that time, and one measure of its desirability is its resale value. Still they were so popular that many old pairs remain in the wild. Other than the L-100s, you can rest assured that most JBL speakers from the 1970s are lifetime investments.\nHistory: Originally the Kasuga Radio Company of Japan, Kenwood opened its first U.S. offices in Los Angeles in the early 1970s. A wildly successful stereo company within a few years, its ubiquity was due to its high-quality components, which sold at mid-price levels.\nModels: Any Kenwood speaker with a model # JL-XXXw are killers\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "title": "Seven Vintage Amplifiers That Won\u2019t Bust Your Budget",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/seven-vintage-amplifiers/",
        "content": "Here\u2019s a scenario that virtually anyone who has entered the home listening game by investing in a vintage power amp or receiver has likely confronted. You\u2019re aware of the brands \u2014 Sansui, McIntosh, Marantz, Pioneer, Harman Kardon \u2014 but you don\u2019t know where to start and you don\u2019t want to mess up by buying something too old, battered or temperamental.\nWe hear you. Unless you\u2019re lucky enough to be the offspring of a noted gearhead like Jimmy Carter, who taught his kids to listen to music through a McIntosh amp and high-end speakers, we all enter audiophilia and intentional listening as novices looking for answers.\nThe good news is that the internet exists, and so do very smart people who know how stuff works. Whole forums are devoted to which companies\u2019 components still hum like Cadillacs and which turned out to be Saturns. For instance, we asked a populous vintage gear Facebook group this question: \u201cWe\u2019re compiling a list of 10 great vintage solid state amps for $600 or so (or less). What models need to be on the list to avoid embarrassing ourselves?\u201d The volume and variety of responses were overwhelming: commenters recommended both receivers and integrated amps, resulting in a drool-worthy bunch of potential purchases.\nBelow: Seven crucial amps that will boost your eardrum intake without denting your wallet too much.\nOne of the best-selling brands of the 1970s, Marantz\u2019s receivers remain easy to find, for now. The 2270, which will run you about $1,000 delivers what the company described in ads as \u201ca walloping 140 watts\u201d per channel. If that\u2019s above your budget, try the 2230, which runs about $700. If you don\u2019t care about an AM/FM receiver, we\u2019d recommend the Marantz 1060 integrated amp, which one commenter called \u201cthe most tube-like integrated amp I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d\n\u201cThe NAD 3020 Is a no-frills, moderately priced amplifier designed to provide state of the art performance and volume levels far in excess of what would be expected from its conservative 20 W per channel power rating,\u201d reads the ad copy for the NAD 3020. A perennial favorite, it was a huge seller for NAD. As such, there are a lot of 3020s around. For a deeper dive on this amp, check outEric Pye\u2018s article\u201cThe NAD 3020 and My Quest for the Holy Grail: Exit to Vintage Street\u201dforecoustics.\nThe original Stereo Review rave from 1970 described the Sansui 4000 as a receiver that \u201cstands with a small, select group of receivers with sufficient power to do justice to almost any speaker system at higher-than-normal listening levels. The Sansui 4000 would rate as an excellent receiver at almost any price. Selling as it does for $379.95, it is clearly an outstanding value.\u201d Indeed, this classic has doubled in price since then on the used market.\nA company that earned a reputation for, in its words, \u201cproducing state-of-the-art power amplifiers at rock-bottom prices,\u201d Hafler offered its models as both kits and finished products.\u00a0This beast of an amp is a lesser-known gem, as are the other models in the company\u2019s DH series, including the 220 and 500.\nFounded by hi-fi legend Robert Carver outside of Seattle, Phase Linear started in the basement of a grocery store in 1971 but within a few years was blowing away audiophiles around the world. A massive amp, it\u2019s another easily found, immediately rewarding purchase.\nSeriously. Trust us on this one: The Harmon Kardon 730 receiver is not only a beautiful thing, but it offers a warmth of tone that will transform the sound of any record for the better. In advertisements, the company characterizes its product as \u201cbeyond specifications,\u201d which is true.\nYou may remember this amp from thesecond edition of our room recordings. The Eico Hf-81 was first introduced in 1959 and is a low powered 14W amplifier that pairs well with efficient speakers (they sound great with our vintage Klipsch Cornwalls). It\u2019s a bit harder to find than the rest of these on the list and may take a bit of work to tune and maintain, but once properly set up, this unassuming amp will beat out most anything you\u2019ll find in its $800 \u2013 $1,000 price range. There\u2019s been a growing cult following around this one so grab it if you can find one at a good price!\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/mcintosh-mc3500/",
        "content": "More than 50 years ago, the hi-fi magazine Stereo Review opened its assessment of the then-new McIntosh MC-3500 monoblock power amp with a note of caution.\n\u201cWe try (not always successfully) to avoid superlatives in our equipment reports. They have a way of backfiring \u2014 something better is sure to come along sooner or later and make us eat our words,\u201d wrote the critic in a 1969 review \u2014 with a caveat.\n\u201cHowever, when it comes to the McIntosh MC-3500 power amplifier, nothing less than superlatives will do \u2014 and it is unlikely to find itself as one-of-a-crowd in the near future.\u201d\nLittle did the writer know. The game-changing power amp upended the concert business after its introduction in 1968. Famously, it powered Woodstock and Altamont, and the Grateful Dead\u2019s soundman Owsley \u201cBear\u201d Stanley started employing the amps not long after they were introduced. A dozen of them, including Garcia\u2019s onstage MC2300 unit, were recently auctioned off during aDead gear auction.\nLast week McIntosh stunned the audio community when it unveiled the \u201csomething better\u201d of the review\u2019s prediction: an updated version of the ground-rumbling amp called the MC3500 Vacuum Tube Amplier Mk II.\nThe massive unit will blow the windows out of your penthouse.\nCheck the overview, according to McIntosh:\n\u201cThe MC3500 Vacuum Tube Amplifier Mk II is a conservatively rated 350 Watt monoblock that takes its inspiration from the original 1968-71 MC3500 and incorporates everything we have learned about vacuum tube amplifier design since the 1960s. It has been upgraded to modern standards and with modern components to deliver an audio performance worthy of its predecessor and the legacy of their shared model number \u2013 all while adhering to the original design as much as possible.\u201d\nThe designers succeeded. Distinctively modern, the blue-tinted output meter is larger and centered on the face instead of offset to the side. It exudes serious power, and while we haven\u2019t been lucky enough to experience one in action, we\u2019ll report back when we do.\nIt retails for $15,000, and you\u2019ll need two of them.\nhttps://www.mcintoshlabs.com/products/amplifiers/MC3500"

        "content": "To hear the speaker-maker Devon Turnbull, whose DJ and graffiti name is OJAS, discuss the intentions in creating his audio company of the same name is to capture with perfect clarity In Sheep\u2019s Clothing\u2019s core mission.\n\u201cI started what I think of as my audio practice out of an interest in this form of listening to recorded music in a way that\u2019s ritualistic,\u201d the Brooklyn-based Turnbull told the King of Audiophilia, Steve Guttenberg, in a recently released interview.\n\u201cI want my hi-fi to be a bit like a shrine. I want to enter a space \u2026 where I can get lost in music and experience music in a way that is more intentional than background music, essentially.\u201d\nTurnbull\u2019s vision has captured the imagination of audiophiles and hi-fi stores the world over. The reasons can be found in his exquisitely designed, Guttenberg-approved OJAS speaker systems.\nTurnbull\u2019s biography, published on the company\u2019s fantastic website, provides a few reasons why:\nOJAS is the creative pen name of Devon Turnbull. As a university student studying Audio Engineering he started using the name across a variety of disciplines including graffiti, music, graphic design and clothing design. In 2003 Turnbull co-founded the clothing brand Nom de Guerre with Isa Saalabi, Wil Whitney and Holly Harnsongkram. For the next decade, while primarily working in fashion, the name OJAS was kept alive on sound sculptures Turnbull was crafting for himself and a growing number of audio enthusiasts around the world. With a particular interest in high efficiency speakers and low powered tube amplifiers, Ojas audio equipment aims to bring realistic, natural sound to the listener. These products are the result of two decades of experimentation, engineering and explorations in the audio underground.\nTurnbull\u2019s interview with Guttenberg offers a look inside the mind, and the creative space, of an audio engineer whose innovations are expanding the conversation on listening culture."

        "title": "ISC\u2019s Guide to Audiophile Listening Bars Around the World",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/isc-guide-listening-bars/",
        "content": "In recent years, hi-fi and listening bars have caught on outside its Tokyo origins with what feels like a new audiophile driven cafe or bar opening daily. Taking inspiration from Japan\u2019s well-established institution of record bars, music and audio enthusiasts around the globe have been building unique spaces, creating environments that appeal to fanatics and casual listeners alike.\nSome have taken a more Kissa-inspired approach, creating intimate pocket-sized venues to showcase a humble system solely used to play album sides. Others have created elite Mancuso-style dance floors to elevate the club experience. Whatever the venue size, we\u2019re always excited to explore new places to discover music.\nBelow, a list of listening bars that have cropped up around the world.\nBased in London\u2019s Kings Cross district, Paul Noble\u2019s Spiritland opened its doors in 2016 and still stands as one of the great new entries in the world of hi-fi bars. The cafe-by-day, bar-by-night venue was built strictly for listening, with an emphasis on in-depth musical programming showcased on their world-class Living Voice sound system.\nVinyl Factory did a quickgear tourif you\u2019d like to peek at the goods, which include their custom Living Voice speakers and crossovers, Triode tube amps, a Kuzma XL DC turntable (!), Isonoe modded Technics 1200\u2019s, and (not featured but a recent update) their custom 50kg solid brass paneled Isonoe rotary mixer. The brass beauty has an unheard of 120dB fader cut for complete silence and is capable of delivering +22dBm (power ratio in decibels ) at <0.0003% THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) (1Khz), rendering it (with even all the faders maxed out) nearly impossible to distort. The front panel is also covered in 10mm-thick brass that slowly decays under the acids of each DJ\u2019s fingers, meaning \u201ceveryone that plays will leave their mark.\u201d\nPotato Head in Hong Kong is the second overseas venue by the Indonesian-based hi-fi / hotel family. Designed by Sou Fujimoto, the vibrant space offers a combo of Indonesian archipelago cuisine, cocktails, and of course, a dedicated \u201cMusic Room\u201d for listening. The room is a discrete backspace with inlaid JBL 4355 speakers, an Alpha Recording System 4100 mixer with their 3500 crossover, and a pair of modded Technics tables. We also highly recommend checking their original Hi-fi offering, Studio Eksotika, in Bali.\nThe Sunshine State gets its first listening bar with Dante\u2019s HiFI, which opened last month in Wynwood. One of the owners, Sven Vogtland, said the bar was inspired by a trip to Tokyo where he jumped around listening bars with his friends Khruangbin. Hoping to bring a level of sophistication the Miami music scene hasn\u2019t seen before, the partners enlisted the legendary DJ, professor, author, and music historian/collector Rich Medina to oversee the music. As for hardware, it\u2019s a little hard to make out what they got powering the house, but the booth contains a new Mastersounds boutique Radius 4 valve mixer, and the bar appears to have a Line Magnetic tube amp paired with a fresh pair of Klipsch Cornwalls \u2014 with some Altec horns, to boot.\nMexico City\u2019s Little Tokyo district holds the new hi-fi spot Tokyo Music Bar. Founded by Edo Kobayashi, the main objective of the space is to provide Japanese food made in Mexico on the same level as it\u2019s served in its homeland. Tokyo Music bar appears to be modeled after the great Ginza Music Bar in Tokyo, sharing the same set of Tannoy Westminster speakers bookending the bar, identical McIntosh MC452\u2019s for power and, of course, a beautiful collection of our favorite Garrard 301 turntables for the spinning.\nPublic Records opened its doors in late 2019 and is the brainchild of Brooklyn residents and partners musician Francis Harris, Shane Davis, and VanderWal. The venue features three unique rooms: a hi-fi record bar, an intimate performance space called the Sound Room, and an all-day vegan caf\u00e9 and record shop.\u00a0Working closely with Devon Turnbull of Ojas and Jason Ojeda of Global Audio Systems, the Brooklyn crew built one of the distinguished sound systems available to the public. With the team using a combination of custom Ojas speakers and tube amplifiers, Altec horns, and custom Isonoe mixers in both rooms. But the cherry on top here is the Sound Room, one of the most immersive spaces the US has to offer; it\u2019s lined with perforated walls and built under the council of Arup, a company that\u2019s brought acoustical engineering expertise to opera houses around the world.\nLocated on the second floor of the historic Romano House, this restaurant-bar-lounge has a lovely wooden and analog feel with a vintage soundsystem designed by Eldad Bermanhuge. The system includes custom made 3-way speakers, Tannoy Little Gold Monitors, and eight Amplifiers, including fifty year old lamp amps. The plant vibe is great as well and, from the photos at least, there seems to be magic happening there throughout the day with local and international selectors playing on a classic Bozak rotary.\nChris Manak aka Peanut Butter Wolf\u2019s Gold Line bar opened up in Highland Park back in 2018. The vinyl-only, whiskey high ball on tap, hi-fi bar and lounge is located directly under the Stones Throws office and houses Wolf\u2019s massive, all-genre vinyl collection that local selectors play from nearly every night. The McIntosh amp, Altec Lansing speaker, Bozak rotary mix soundsystem was put together by Kevin Carney of Silverlake boutique clothing shop Mohawk General Store.\nWe first got tipped to this pocket sized \u201cSeinfeld\u201d reference wine bar by our good friend Linus Booth of S\u00e9ance Centre. The vibe is totally up our alley with local selectors sharing mixes and playing frequently on a sound system comprised of Klipschorns, a Condesa rotary, and McIntosh tube amps. The food looks great as well\u2026\nRhino\u00e7\u00e9ros is the closest thing to a jazz Kissa west of Japan, with its ultra-simple concept: one turntable, two speakers, and jazz. No DJ\u2019s here, with most likely the owners Benedict and Martina playing full album sides from their humble collection that focuses primarily on jazz. Serving up wine and drinks, the speakeasy\u2019s proper emphasis is on\u00a0intimacy and sound. At the heart of this cozy, secret music room is a pair of wooden Bowers & Wilkins speakers from 1976, a round Micro-Seiki Turntable from \u201981, and a quad amp and preamp from the early seventies.\nOur good friend Dor from Fault Radio recently linked us up with the good people behind Oakland\u2019s Bar Shiru. The jazz-kissa inspired, vinyl-only listening bar is the first of it\u2019s kind in the Bay area and focuses on jazz records played in their entirety. The sound system was built by Adam Wexler, owner of Resolution Audio Video, and is comprised of Line Magnetic amps and speakers, an Isonoe mixer, and SME turntables. Additional speakers from Devore Fidelity, Dynaudio, and Bowers & Wilkins are also used in the various listening zones in the space.\nChee Shimizuonce statedof Brilliant Corners, \u201cTo have a place like this is the biggest change in years.\u201d Opened by brothers Amit and Aneesh Patel in 2014, Brilliant Corners has established itself as one of the best around. Located in Dalston, the Mancuso-inspired bar and restaurant holds his iconic four point Klipshcorn system with Mcintosh amps, while serving up meticulously prepared Japanese food and natural wine. We also highly recommend looking into their Giant Steps project, a traveling world class soundsystem containing four Klipsch La Scala\u2019s.

Among them, notes Jarnow, is \u201cJerry Garcia\u2019s personal favorite, with a Budweiser sticker on the front.\u201d\nBelow, some highlights, along with details excerpted from the Sotheby\u2019s catalog.\n\u201cLot includes: Sansui 4 channel 130 watt receiver in wooden case. \u2014 2 Klipsch La ScalasSpeakers, painted black, with Grateful Dead spray painted in green, \u201cSupport Your Local Hell\u2019s Angels\u201d sticker, handles on sides. \u2014 2 Hard Truckers D140 Speaker Cabinets, wood, birch plywood, heavy aluminum brackets, one with \u201cSupport Your Local Hells Angels\u201d sticker and \u201cDead\u201d in felt-tip on back.\u201d\nGrateful Dead insider \u201cBig\u201d Steve Parish:\n\u201cThe Klipsch speakers were purchased by Jerry\u2019s mother for the first small PA used by the Grateful Dead, 1966/67, then stored in our warehouse until the early 70\u2019s , when Jerry asked us, as a gesture of friendship, to gift them to the Richmond Hells Angels for a music system for their clubhouse. The 2 black Kllipsch plus the mid range speakers that the crew built and powered by the Sansui amp were used at the Richmond clubhouse from 1973 to 2019. We present this historical small PA with a great history.\u201d\nGarcia\u2019s \u201cBudman\u201d power amp, from the catalog (top): Solid-state power amplifier (10.5H x 19W x 17D), 300 watts per channel or 600 watts per monoblock, with anodized gold and black panel. Serial number: 1Y460. With original \u201cGrateful Dead\u201d black rolling road case with stickers and stencils.\n\u201cBig\u201d Steve Parish:\u201cJerry played through Fender Twins and they were loud, but everyone always wanted to be louder for the big gig, especially outdoors. Dan Healy figured out how to take a line out from Jerry\u2019s guitar amp, first into a McIntosh 350 tube amp during the early Wall of Sound set up. When the 2300 power amp came out we bought 70 of them, and put them throughout the system, but this is the one that Jerry liked the best and he played through it for years. It really made that Twin sound huge and became part of his signature tone at the time. At some point, Ram Rod stuck that Budweiser Budman sticker on it one day and it\u2019s instantly recognizable as Jerry\u2019s.\u201d\nWeir\u2019s power amp (bottom). Solid-state power amplifier (10.5 x 19 x 17\u2033), 300 watts per channel or 600 watts monoblock, with anodized gold and black panel. Front panel with tape reading \u201c1011\u201d below power meters, duct tape reading \u201cM-9\u201d below right power meter. Serial number: ED010. With original white Anvil rolling road case, front with Grateful Dead sticker, lid with Steal Your Face stickers, green tape reading \u201c189,\u201d white tape with \u201cQ2 EQP.\u201d\n\u201cBig Steve\u201d Parish:\u201cThis was used in the Wall of Sound for Bob Weir\u2019s guitar, later used in a keyboard rig for Brent.\u201d\n\u201cBig\u201d Steve Parish:\u201cThese extremely rare old tube McIntosh amps were purchased by Owsley for his P.A. system experiments at Alembic studios, and were used at Altamont. As the years passed, Bear gave them to Ram Rod to use for his home speaker system.\u201d\nFrom the catalog: \u201cThese horn tweeters were standard in the iconic Altec Lansing Voice of the Theater speakers, which were originally part of the Dead\u2019s live sound, before it became evident that the size and weight of these were unsuited to the rigors of extensive touring. The limitations of the Altec cabinets were one of the reasons that the band turned to their own engineers and roadies to design and build the speaker array that became the Wall of Sound.\u201d\n\u201cBig\u201d Steve Parish:\u201cThis was from one of the earliest sets of speakers owned by the Dead and part of a jury-rigged PA system that Owsley built. This tweeter was at Altamont, which is very, very cool.\u201d\nFrom the catalog: Tape recorder (12 x 11 x 6\u2019\u2019). With two \u201cGood Old Grateful Dead\u201d stickers, one \u201cKeep on Trucking\u201d sticker, and one Rhode Island sticker.\nA conveniently sized and sleek battery-powered, four-head recorder with 7-inch reels, XLR microphone connections, VU meters and noise reduction. The present model was one of the best choices of its time for easy recording live in the field.\n\u201cBig\u201d Steve Parish:\u201cRam Rod\u2019s personal reel-to-reel sometimes used by Owsley and Bob Matthews to record live Grateful Dead shows in the late 60\u2019s, early 70\u2019s.\u201d\nFrom the catalog: Speaker cabinet built for the Jerry Garcia Band, ca. 1970s. 4\u00d712 speaker cabinet (19 x 13 x 52\u2019\u2019). Wood and birch plywood, with 4 JBL Model E120 speakers, black cloth grill cover, marked \u201cLOO\u201d in white felt tip, tape on side and bottom.\nFrom the catalog: Open rack for making multiple after show recordings, 1990s. Metal reinforced rolling wooden case (25.5 x 25.5 x 35\u2019\u2019). Crazy Moon smiley face sticker, channels labeled at rear, with two fans for cooling the unit, one on each side.\nRack containing:\nKEBA Research and Development\u2014Real Time Duplication System, consisting of 5 dual open faced cassette decks, patch cables stored in rear. Serial numbers: 111925, 111924, 111927, 111923, 111887.\n\u201cBig Steve\u201d Parish:\u201cThis deck was used to make copies of concerts to give to the band and crew to review the show and adjust the sound and make changes for the next gig.\u201d"

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/tokyo-jazz-kissa/",
        "content": "Currently, about 100 jazz kissa and jazz bars are open in Tokyo. The number of such rooms in the region began to increase in the early 1960s and peaked in the late 1970s. At the peak, an estimated 200 jazz kissas were operating in Tokyo, but only about 20 remaining rooms have been in business since the 1960s and 1970s. In the past, many jazz bars were open in the morning, but as the owners have aged it\u2019s become difficult to maintain extended hours, so many stores open in the evening. Sadly, many shops have lost their founders, so their families and regular customers have taken over management.\nBelow are fifteen jazz kissa and jazz bars founded in the 1960s and 1970s that remain in operation. Each is full of personality and worth a visit. Use this as a reference when you come to Tokyo someday.\n3-14-10 Nishinippori,Arakawa-ku / Founded in 1955/Closed in 2022\nCharmant was one of the oldest jazz kissas in Tokyo. At first, the ground floor was open as a coffee shop and the second floor was open as a bar, but after the founder died in 2010 and the shop\u2019s regulars assumed control of management, only the second floor remained open up until it\u2019s permanent closing in June 2022. The loud volume produced by vintage JBL speakers was intense..\n2-1-11 Nishiasakusa,Taito-ku / Founded in 1962\nA typical jazz kissa in the 1960s, Flamingo was renovated in 1993 to become a coffee shop on the first floor and a jazz bar on the second floor. Its turntables, CD players, preamps, and power amps are all made by McIntosh, and they\u2019re hooked to Altec 802 and TAD TL1601 speakers. The bar has a collection of more than 4,000 records, with an emphasis on piano trios and jazz vocalists. The volume is not so loud, which makes the room a relaxing place to enjoy whiskey and cocktails.\nB1,3-15-2 Shinjuku,Shinjuku-ku / Founded in 1967\nDUG was opened as a sister store to DIG, a jazz kissa in Japan. Conversation was prohibited at DIG, but DUG\u2019s concept was looser, with attendees talking with friends while drinking and listening to jazz. DIG closed in 1983, but after two relocations, DUG is now the most famous jazz kissa in Japan. It\u2019s not a shop where you can enjoy jazz at a loud volume, but the unique and cozy space has created a lot of fans.\n1-8,Yotsuya,Shinjuku-ku / Founded in 1967\nLoud playback with high-spec audio composed mainly of JBL speakers and a collection of more than 20,000 records and CDs, Eagle is a spacious space for relaxing. The venue\u00a0 maintains rules prohibiting conversation from 11:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. but evenings the atmosphere changes to a jazz bar and you can talk until the store closes. If you want to immerse yourself in the world of jazz and enjoy the essence of jazz kissas, please check out Eagle.\n1F Mansion Suzuno,3-2-10 Honcho,Nakano-ku / Founded in 1970\nThe owner is a former staff member of DIG and a well-known record collector. Since its opening in Shibuya, it had been one of the most popular jazz kissas in Tokyo, but in 1989, when it moved from Shibuya to Nakanoshinbashi, it changed its management policy from an orthodox jazz kissa style to a coffee shop that is familiar to the residents of the neighborhood. The audio and records are the same as those used in Shibuya. The volume is low. The owner is old but still alive and well \u2014 and still plays maniacal records.\n5-6-14 Daizawa,Setagaya-ku / Founded in 1973\nIn the corner of Shimokitazawa, which is crowded with young people, a woman has owned and operated this kissa alone for 48 years. Posy was open during the day until about 20 years ago, but due to the owner\u2019s age, she now only opens at night. She has traveled often to jazz festivals in the United States and Europe, and the walls are decorated with jazz legends\u2019 autographs on colored paper. Posy\u2019s not loud, but it has an atmosphere unique to an owner who loves jazz.\n7-61-8 Nishikamata,Ota-ku / Founded in 1975\nChyokuristu Enjin is a Japanese translation of \u201cPithecanthropus Erectus,\u201d the founder\u2019s\u00a0 favorite Charlie Mingus album. After the original owner retired in 2015, a regular customer assumed management responsibilities. The founder\u2019s concept of wanting people to enjoy jazz while drinking coffee or alcohol rather than focusing solely on the records has been inherited. The interior of the store is the same as when it was founded more than 45 years ago. Open only at night.\n1F Izumi Heights 5-31-14 Daizawa,Setagaya-ku / Founded in 1975\nThe owner started this jazz bar after presiding over a theater company and has produced many cultural events so far in the space. Shimokitazawa is a town where many people work in theater and film, which means that actors, film directors, theater producers, writers, poets, painters, illustrators, etc. often come to this shop. Paintings and photographs are often exhibited in the space, and the musical focus is on various types of jazz, from bebop to avant-garde. The system\u2019s not overwhelmingly loud, but it sounds excellent.\n5-33-19 Hakusan,Bunkyo-ku / Founded in 1976\n\u201cEigakan\u201d means \u201ctheater\u201d in Japanese. Before opening the bar, the owner worked on making movies and television, which means it\u2019s decorated with vintage movie posters from around the world. Of particular note is the store\u2019s excellent sound system, which the proprietor has assembled over a long period of time. It\u2019s one of the best in Tokyo, and with a vast collection of rare jazz records, an excellent place to visit.\n2F MarcoPoroBldg,1-8-14 Honcho,Kichijoji,Musashino-shi / Founded in 1976\nThe town of Kichijoji was once crowded with more than 10 jazz kissas. When the boom was at its peak, Scratch opened as a specialty store for crossover and fusion sounds. About 20 years ago, the founder passed over control of Scratch to the bar\u2019s manager, who has continued the business. The selector plays his share of bebop, but focuses on 1970s fusion, which draws a different clientele than many other kissas. It opens at noon and offers a wide selection of food and drink options.\n1-15-15 Taishido,Setagaya-ku / Founded in 1977\nThis jazz bar has been open in Sangenjaya for 44 years. The founder died about 20 years ago so his wife and son took over. The son, an avid jazz enthusiast, plays hardcore jazz, reflecting the sensibilities of his mother, who frequented jazz kissa DIG. Food and drink options include a wide selection of sake and sashimi, as well as whisky and western dishes. Their speakers? JBL 4312XP.\n5-1-2 Akasaka,Minato-ku / Founded in 1977\nThe name of the store is French because the bar originally focused on French chansons, but after it sold the new owner was a jazz freak so she transformed it into a bar specializing in her obsession. In 2011, she relocated from Harajuku to Akasaka. Sound-wise, Volontaire owns vintage JBL LE8Ts built in the 1960s \u2014 a very popular model for Japanese audiophiles and jazz kissas. The JBLs are powered by a JBL SA600 integrated amp, and amplify classic jazz, pre-WWII swing, New Orleans jazz and be-bop records.\n5-17-12 Minamikarasuyama,Setagaya-ku / Founded in 1978\nThis jazz kissa retains its original appearance, so if you want to know the atmosphere of a room in its 70\u2019s heyday, come here. You can feel as if you have traveled back 40 years. After the death of the founder, his wife and son have taken over the management of the store. It\u2019s a coffee shop during the day but a jazz bar at night. Enjoy grooves while drinking alcohol and tasting the dishes that have been around since the establishment. Ragtaime houses about 4,000 records, which ensures continued variety.\n2F YO Bldg.,1-13-6 Kabukicho,Shinjuku-ku / Founded in 1978\nLocated on the second floor of a multi-tenant building in the middle of Kabukicho, the most obscure area in Tokyo, Narcisse has a long history. The owner\u2019s father founded it before World War II, and became a place where novelists and poets gathered. It transformed into a jazz kissa starting in the 1970s. For sound, Narcisse employs British-built Good Man speakers. The owner concentrates on avant-garde jazz, but plays fascinating records one after another while conversing with her clientele.\n4F Miyazaki Bldg,8-2Asahicho,Hatchioji-shi / Founded in 1979\nHarineko is located in the westernmost part of Tokyo. The nearest station to this shop, Hachioji Station, is about 50 km west of Tokyo Station, which takes about an hour by train. At the time of its founding, the owner also ran a bookstore in the same building. The store\u2019s name is derived from the title of one of the owner\u2019s favorite children\u2019s picture books and has an interior designed as a relaxing cafe, but you can listen to serious jazz at a loud volume coming from JBL 4343 speakers.\nNext month, Katsumasa will publish a photo book of jazz kissas including 130 of the Japanese jazz kissas he visited in 2014.\u00a0Divided into Vol.1 and Vol.2, Vol.1 will be published next month and Vol.2 will be published in December. A4 variant version, all colors, about 140 pages each.\nLook out for the upcoming likely essential release on:\nInstagram:https://www.instagram.com/jazz_kissa/\nWebsite:https://jazzcity.store/\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "content": "Though his name is nearly lost to time, starting in the 1950s the writer Hans Fantel was a ubiquitous presence in audiophile and stereo-curious households. A gear columnist who regularly published in Hi-Fi Stereo Review, the New York Times and Opera News, Fantel was the guy who\u2019d sit you down and, without condescension, explain difficult technical concepts in plainspoken, eloquent language.\nTake this basic explanation on the concept of \u201cacoustic feedback,\u201d which, writes Fantel, \u201coccurs when sound vibrations from the loudspeaker travel back to the record player. The phono stylus then picks up the vibrations from the speaker along with the modulations in the record groove and feeds both signals to the amplifier and speaker. The result is \u2014 at best \u2014 a slight tonal blur or a rumbling noise. At worst, the reamplified vibrations pile up, overload the amplifier, and produce a loud rumbling, humming sound that, if sustained, could damage the speakers.\u201d\nFantel\u2019s brief rundown on the importance of choosing a cartridge is concise and jargon-free:\n\u201cAfter the loudspeaker, the phono cartridge has the most noticeable effect on the kind of sound you get from your records. In fact, some golden-ear types have been known to use one cartridge for its warm, blending effect on large-sound orchestral or choral works and another cartridge with a sharper, more analytic response for jazz and chamber music.\nThe reason cartridges differ so widely in the tonal coloration they produce is that, like loudspeakers, they are transducers. Cartridges translate information from one form of energy to another-from mechanical motion into electric signals. As in most translations, certain subtleties are lost-or added-and these account for the sound differences between one cartridge and another.\nAlmost all phono cartridges-or pickups, as they are sometimes called-are miniature electrical generators in which the motion of the stylus as it follows the record grooves generates a voltage proportional to that motion. Precise tracing by the stylus is the first requirement for faithful reproduction.\u201d\nIn 1973, the writer adapted his regular column, Beginners Only, which he changed to Audio Basics in the mid-1960s, to become \u201cThe True Sound of Music: A Practical Guide to Sound Equipment for the Home.\u201d A tool that will help those looking to explore the world of vintage hi-fi, the book tackles the nuts and bolts of sound reproduction with the aim of simplifying the processes for the layperson.\nBelow is a column from the Oct. 1970 issue of Stereo Review.\nThough out of print, \u201cThe True Sound of Music: A Practical Guide to Sound Equipment for the Home,\u201d is easy to find used for under $15, and is filled with illustrations and photos to further amplify his points."

        "content": "The whole thing can be overwhelming, building a sound system, especially for those whose listening habits have been shaped by device-to-eardrum headphones, which have no concern for the environmental pleasure that comes from filling a room with sound.\nBut broken down, a stereo system for playing records need only involve four elements: Amplifier, turntable, cartridge and speakers. Each piece is essential, of course, but first on your list should be speakers.\nThat advice stems from the truism that a system can sound only as good as its speakers. The reasoning is simple, as hi-fi writer Norman Eisenberg so eloquently wrote in the November, 1975 issue of High Fidelity magazine, one of a half dozen expert glossies covering the then-thriving audio entertainment market.\n\u201cThe speaker is the mouthpiece of your system: it is the device that stirs the unwilling air in your room into the patterns of molecular compression and expansion that you perceive as Mozart or Mancini, Chicago or the Chicago Symphony,\u201d Eisenberg writes.\n\u201cYour big, fat, dumb amplifier just sits there devouring AC power through its umbilical line-cord and converting it into electronic replicas of sound,\u201d the writer continues. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t care less, for its basic operation, whether it reposes in a high-ceilinged restoration of an 18th-century drawing room or in a four-by-four planked outhouse. But your speakers are much fussier. They have to bite into their acoustical environment \u2014 to taste that environment, so to speak. If they are displeased by what they taste, they will let you know at once, like a kid with a plate of spinach.\u201d\nEisenberg\u2019s essay makes an incredibly convincing argument, and is worth reading in its entirety."

        "title": "A New World of Deep Listening with the Syng Cell Alpha Triphonic Speaker",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/syng-cell-alpha/",
        "content": "I wasn\u2019t quite sure what to think when I first saw Syng\u2019s Cell Alpha speaker. The clear, almost droid-like design seemed a world (and maybe light years) away from traditional hi-fi speakers or x-point surround setups that I had seen before. Syng\u2019s website provided a few clues. \u201cCell Alpha marks the birth of a new standard in spatial sound. With Triphonic audio, it transforms your space into a field of clear, detailed sound \u2013 a fully immersive experience that puts you at the center of your favorite music and entertainment.\u201d\nI spent an afternoon listening to a dual Cell Alpha setup with Syng\u2019s co-founder Damon Way. The session featured Suzanne Kraft\u2019s\u201cNo Worries,\u201dSlowdive\u2019s\u201cSugar for the Pill\u201dand The Haxan Cloak\u2019s\u201cExcavation,\u201dalong with a few selections of my own including Knopha\u2019sNothing NilEP and the tried-and-true classics\u201cI Believe in You\u201dby Talk Talk and Tracy Chapman\u2019s\u201cFast Car.\u201d\nYou\u2019re not just listening to the song, you\u2019re listeninginsidethe song, which opens up an entirely new world of deep listening.\nIt was immediately apparent that this was not your typical hi-fi speaker. Despite being in a two-speaker configuration, the classic triangle \u201csweet spot\u201d idea did not seem to apply here. Instead, the Cell Alphas produced a crystal clear field that filled the surrounding space. While the traditional instrumentation of \u201cI Believe in You\u201d and \u201cFast Car\u201d was produced perfectly, the speakers seemed to really shine with modern electronics, providing pinpoint accuracy in placing wide stereo sounds within the spatial field. I loved the way heavily panned drums and synthesizers seemed to sweep across the massive sound stage like waves. The dark, ambient white noise of \u201cExcavation\u201d was a particular highlight.\nThe listening session led to an ongoing event series at ourNeuehouse residencyshowcasing the Cell Alpha\u2019s \u201cSuper Spatial Sound\u201d on a four speaker configuration. Curated by dublab\u2019s Mark \u201cFrosty\u201d McNeill, the series has featured modern ambient music with Leaving Records\u2019Matthewdavid and Celia Hollander, spatial dub withThe Scientist, and celestial sounds fromMary Lattimore and Julianna Barwick.\nAfter a month of listening to a broad range of music through these futuristic speaker pods, I\u2019ve found that the best way to explain the experience is that \u201cit\u2019s like you\u2019re sitting inside of the track.\u201d You\u2019re not just listening to the song, you\u2019re listeninginsidethe song, which opens up an entirely new world of deep listening.\nThe Cell Alpha is available now starting at $1,799. Join us for our next listening event withSilent Servant and Robert Laneto hear the speakers for yourself or visitsyngspace.comfor more info and how to purchase.\nTo dive deeper into the origins of the Cell Alpha, I spoke to the team behind Syng about Triphonic sound and how they\u2019re rethinking the art of speaker design.\nThe Syng Cell Alpha is the world\u2019s first Triphonic speaker. Can you explain what that means and what the speaker does differently from traditional stereo speakers?\nTriphonic audio is our object-based sonic architecture. It starts with the Cell calibrating to\u00a0the room that it is in, including wall detection and the position of any other Cells, if you\u00a0have multiples. The software spatializes the music, while the hardware projects the\u00a0 sound to the right place in the room. We deliver a listening experience unlike any other; it\u2019s spatial sound out loud without having to rely on content that has been pre-mixed for\u00a0it.\nWhere does Syng\u2019s Triphonic sound sit within the world of typical 5.1, 6.1, 7.1 surround stereo systems?\nSurround formats are limited to a discrete number of channels that require a separate\u00a0speaker for each one. The Syng Triphonic technology renders those channels in their\u00a0respective spatial locations by appropriately combining the beam patterns of all\u00a0available Cells in the system. As a result, it can render all surround formats (current and\u00a0future) by optimizing the spatial mapping of each channel to a position in the room with\u00a0a much smaller number of speakers.\nI was really surprised by the clarity of the lower frequencies. I\u2019m used to bigger is\u00a0 better when it comes to subs\u2026 Can you provide more detail on how the force balanced subwoofers work?\nThe Cell Alpha subwoofers use extremely powerful motors and have very high\u00a0excursion capabilities compared to typical speakers this size. As a result we are able to\u00a0 move more air, more efficiently, than would be expected from a speaker this size.\u00a0 Additionally, the force balanced configuration prevents unwanted vibration from the\u00a0 speaker enclosure resulting in cleaner sound.\nI love the idea of creating a space where you can feel and touch the sound. It reminds me a bit of dub sound systems where you feel the frequencies through\u00a0 your whole body. What were some of the team\u2019s inspirations when designing the\u00a0Cell Alpha?\nThe founding principle of Syng is to create a single device, that can cooperate in any\u00a0quantity and in any layout such that it forms a single sound field, that can play any form\u00a0of audio content and fill your entire space with precise sound.\nFrom a design perspective, a quote from Christopher Stringer that I think really\u00a0encapsulates his approach is:\n\u201cI don\u2019t ask what shape that I want to impose on a speaker. I ask, what shape does the\u00a0 speaker want to be? My job as a designer is to get out of the way, to pay attention, find\u00a0the simple path through the clouds of complexity and artfully embody principle. Speakers are wonderful subjects in that the biggest component is air, so it is an\u00a0 opportunity to have an expressive design, but what you express is its purpose and our\u00a0purpose is to shape sound, to distill and find the purest embodiment in support of the\u00a0founding principle.\u201d\nObviously, there\u2019s a lot spatially that the Cell Alpha can do besides just playing\u00a0 tracks. It\u2019s still very early but what are some creative ways you\u2019ve seen the Syng speaker system used so far in spaces?\nFrom the beginning our thesis was that music was trapped in an aging format that could\u00a0not support immersive new media experiences due to its lack of flexibility and range.\u00a0We felt that we could push through this, and create new ways for sound to be\u00a0experienced. This led to a number of experiments involving the separation of songs into\u00a0 their discrete parts, and allowing for the listener to apply agency over what they were\u00a0 hearing through interactive and spatialization tools. Pieces of this will be introduced over\u00a0 the next year for which we will be sure to keep you informed about.\nSyng seems to have a much broader goal of advancing sound. Do you consider\u00a0 these speakers to be a replacement for traditional hi-fi systems or an alternative?\nThe problem with traditional hi-fi systems is that while they sound amazing, they are too\u00a0 complex for the average user, with a steep learning curve. The alternative options on\u00a0 the market are easy to use but sacrifice on experience and sound quality. Syng can be\u00a0 an alternative for people who want great sound but a simpler system or a rest of the\u00a0home addition for people who have existing hi-fi systems.\nWebsite:https://syngspace.com/\nInstagram:https://www.instagram.com/syngspace/"

        "content": "Though it might now seem hard to fathom, there was a time when record retailers and hi-fi shops earned enough bank to advertise on television. Some were local ads hawking super-saver deals; others were paid for by record companies in exchange for placement. Thanks to the magic of the internet, many of these spots have been salvaged and are available to view.\nBelow, a few highlights.\nBritish retailer W.H. Smith cut this choreographed gem of a commercial, one that mirrors how we at In Sheep\u2019s Clothing enter our favorite shops.\n\u201cHere is Jim Coyne, a nice guy in a tough business.\u201d He\u2019s got the deals at the Cleveland Sound Chamber.\n\u201cSuperstars are here at super values.\u201d This spot for Music Plus highlights classic releases by The Doors, ZZ Top, Black Sabbath, Talking Heads, and Genesis.\nThis 1978 ad for the Ronco Record Vacuum features a pitchman who\u2019s obviously on a mission. He walks through a dense shop, album in his hand, ready to slide it into his Ronco and save the day.\nThe best cassette player jingle ever? This song for Panasonic\u2019s Take-N-Tape is way up there.\nFinally, if you\u2019ve got a half-hour to kill, this collection of vintage stereo ads offers a lot of inspired retro salesmanship."

        "content": "After more than a year of forced isolation, creating spaces to share experiences with friends, family, and our local community seems more important than ever. We truly miss the listening sessions we were able to share at the In Sheep\u2019s Clothing hi-fi bar in the Arts District. Our desire has always been to make a place to share music and build a community around the ceremony of deep listening.\nSince shuttering the bar in March, 2020 we\u2019ve been patiently waiting for another opportunity to share music with everyone. That time has arrived. We\u2019re excited to announce that starting on June 23rd, we\u2019ll open the first of many popup listening experiences. We\u2019ve partnered with Neuehouse Hollywood to transform their penthouse floor into a dedicated listening space with the intention of once again creating moments around shared listening.\nThe indoor room will be designed for dedicated listenings on a top-tier hi-fidelity sound system constructed by our friends at Commonwave hi-fi. The outdoor environment will provide a casual hangout space with cocktails, wine, and food.\nDedicated listening sessions will be hosted by ISC staff along with members from our extended family in the analog space \u2014 tastemakers from vinyl digging communities, the hi-fi\u00a0 world and music-focused businesses. Each night will offer different programming around classic albums, artists, musical movements, and audiophile equipment/pressings.\nAs was tradition at the ISC listening bar, all sessions will focus on full album sides. Before each program, guests will fill the seats of the indoor listening space and will be encouraged to stay for the full duration of the recording. New guests will be allowed to enter after each session.\nVisit ourevents pagefor more information and info on how to RSVP.\nJune 23 \u2013Opening Night\nJune 24 \u2013Aquarium Drunkard presents ECM Night\nJune 25 \u2013Motion Ward x Quiet Time\nJune 26 \u2013Sonrisita\nJune 30 \u2013Forager Records Acid Folk/Psych\nJuly 1 \u2013Cell Alpha Listening Session w/ Leaving Records\nJune 25 \u2013Day End Records (Post-punk, No Wave, Dub)\nJuly 3 \u2013dublab w/ DJ Kerry (The Basement)\nJuly 7 \u2013Wandering Spirits: Herbie Hancock\u2019s Mwandishi and Beyond\nJuly 8 \u2013World of Yellow Magic Orchestra\nJuly 9 \u2013Listening with Sam Wilkes\nJuly 10 \u2013Caf\u00e9 Ale + Suzanne Kraft\nJuly 14 \u2013Commonwave Hi-Fi\nJuly 15 \u2013Cell Alpha Listening Session w/ The Scientist\nJuly 16 \u2013Alice Coltrane \u2018Kirtan: Turiya Sings\u2019 (Release Listening Party)\nJuly 17 \u2013Xica Soul\nJuly 21 \u2013Future Days: Krautrock / Berlin-School Night\nJuly 22 \u2013Mount Analog w/ Mahssa Taghinia\nJuly 23 \u2013Lovefingers\nJuly 24 \u2013Numero Group w/ Ken Shipley & Rob Sevier\nJuly 28 \u2013Discreet Music: Brian Eno\u2019s Instrumental & Ambient Works\nJuly 29 \u2013Cell Alpha Listening Session w/ SYNG \u2219 Mary Lattimore and Julianna Barwick\nJuly 30 \u2013Aloha Got Soul w/ Vinyl Don\nJuly 31 \u2013Stepping into Tomorrow: Jazz-Funk Night\nAugust 4 \u2013Analogue Bubblebath: Aphex Twin Night\nAugust 5 \u2013From Brazil to Japan: Global Psychedelic Sounds Night\nAugust 6 \u2013When Love Breaks Down: 80\u2019s Synth Pop / Rock\nAugust 7 \u2013Dublab w/ Jeff Parker (Tortoise)\nAugust 11 \u2013Ragas and Sacred Sounds: Indian Classical Night\nAugust 12 \u2013Cell Alpha Listening Session w/ Syng \u2219 Silent Servant\nAugust 13 \u2013City Pop Night with Kapsoul and Tsugu\nAugust 14 \u2013Confusing Mix with Josh Da Costa\nAugust 18 \u2013Dan the Automator\nAugust 19 \u2013Devendra Banhart and Noah Georgeson: Refuge Listening Party\nAugust 20 \u2013Discostan (Diasporic Discotheque)\nAugust 21 \u2013Make Some Room: Sade Night\nAugust 25 \u2013Liquid / Devotion Songs with Josiah Steinbrick\nAugust 19 \u2013Wild, Weird World of The Boredoms\nAugust 20 \u2013Victor Rodriguez (Bears in Space)\nAugust 21 \u2013Songs of Innocence: David Axelrod Night\nSeptember 1 \u2013Sakura 1999: Susumu Yokota Japanese Ambient / Electronic Night\nSeptember 2 \u2013Dublab w/ Caf\u00e9 Ale & Laura Shumate (Shoegaze & Space Rock Night)\nSeptember 3 \u2013Vin Du Select Qualitite: Contemporary Guitar Music\nSeptember 4 \u2013World of Echo: Arthur Russell Night\nSeptember 8 \u2013Global Spiritual Jazz Night\nSeptember 9 \u2013Lee Scratch Perry Tribute\nSeptember 10 \u2013Reverberation Radio\nSeptember 11 \u2013Studio Ghibli / Joe Hisaishi\nSeptember 15 \u20134AD & Factory Records Night\nSeptember 16 \u2013Wouldn\u2019t You Love to Love Me: Prince Night\nSeptember 17 \u2013ATO Records: Label Showcase\nSeptember 18 \u2013Sceneries Not Songs: Larry Heard Night w/ Franchise\nSeptember 23 \u2013Closing Night: Adrian Younge (Jazz is Dead)"

        "title": "10 Brilliant Takes on Turntable Plinth Design",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/10-turntable-plinths/",
        "content": "The physical experience of playing vinyl helps listeners rationalize elaborate customizations, from record shelves to speaker stands. One of the most gratifying, and perhaps most important areas to upgrade, is the turntable itself.\nManufacturers in the \u201860\u2019s and 70\u2019s like Garrard and Thorens actually created record players meant for aftermarket meddling. In fact, in early department stores merchants made selecting the perfect plinth \u2014 the oft-wooden or metal turntable base \u2014 as easy as selecting the stain color of new kitchen cabinets.\nFor the most part these turntable bases do have some utility. Heavy woods, metals and raw stone all help mitigate the ricocheting of sonic waves that come with listening, which contain the potential of affecting sound quality \u2014 though there is something to be said for design for design\u2019s sake, so expect that to be celebrated here too.\nBelow, some exquisite turntables embedded in custom plinths.\nRon Arad\u2019s \u201cThe Concrete Studio\u201d was in one of his 1983 exhibitions and is among his most iconic works. Arad used concrete to convey an apocalyptic HiFi aesthetic, in the process conjuring up fantasies of a science-fiction dystopia. The complete set-up includes a concrete turntable, amplifier and two speaker towers.\nThis acrylic base is no doubt inspired by dutch abstract painter Piet Mondrian, with its irregular grid pattern of mostly primary colors. A Garrard 401 is cradled in the plinth; the turntable\u2019s compact design made it ideal for an easy weekend customization project.\nThis plinth is a hi-fi masterpiece made by forum user \u201cOvenmitt\u201d and shared on the popular vinyl lovers platformwww.whatsbestforum.com. The hobbyist used a Garrad Pearl for this plinth project, and details the components of his turntables as being made up of \u201cPanzerholtz, Ebony, cherry and/or maple, bamboo, aluminum, and soapstone\u201d. Each of these materials was used in a variety of different ratios, and each created a different sonic personality.\nThis Garrad 301 is set in a stunning block of marble that looks like a 3-D snapshot of the deep ocean. Made by Holger Trass ofanalogue-classics.com, this singular set up does a beautiful job highlighting the turntable and the contrast of the stone.\nThis Garrad 401 was planted into a solid mass of marble by another hobbyist with the username \u201cDoctor Hugocat\u201d fromdynacotubeaudio.forumotion.com. The stone offers a \u201charder\u201d sound, and is most definitely a statement piece. If you\u2019re curious why this one has two tone arms , it\u2019s because having two tonearms or more in your setup makes it less of a hassle to switch-up needle cartridges.\nAudiowood, based in New Orleans, makes custom turntables informed by nature. This burnt piece of burl wood is imposing and serious, and it\u2019s wild organic shapes make for a stunning display.\nThis Garrard 301 sits in a plinth made out of Baltic Birch Plywood, Panzerholz\u00a0 and a layer of man made Slate. It\u2019s the most conventional looking plinth on the list but its intricate wood grain and warmth is worth marveling over. The plinth was made by hi-fi outfitWoodsong Audioin Sandpoint, Idaho.\nYes, another Garrad 301, this one set in a beautiful 90\u2019s acrylic plinth made by DAS Acoustics. The stands that support the unit help reduce environmental noise, creating a perfect listening experience.\nThis Garradd 401 has a minimal coolness that\u2019s evergreen; it was shared by theanalogdept.com. Two cross-sections of what appears to be birch are immaculate specimens, part of a brilliantly designed project.\nThis Plinth was an official option for buyers of Thorens turntables in the 70s. The two tone wood has a balance that\u2019s both sophisticated and playful.\nIf you\u2019re feeling inspired to make your own plinths now, The New Yorkshire Workshop has a well documented how to.

        "title": "Intro to Hi-fi Audio: Speaker Placement & Room Treatment Basics",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/speaker-placement-room-treatment-basics/",
        "content": "With all the time, money and effort spent buying and putting together the hi-fi components of your dreams, if your speakers aren\u2019t positioned properly in your listening space, your goal of achieving the best possible acoustics will remain elusive. All speakers are built differently. As such, each pair has unique placement specifications. At the same time, your listening room has its own dimensions and layout. Most often, proper speaker placement for any given room is achieved by trial and error. The fix can be as easy as moving your speakers closer to your listening positions or doing the opposite: pulling your chair or sofa closer to the speaker themselves. But other variables come into play when plotting for your own sonic sweet spot.\nBelow, we offer tips on how to best attain optimal fidelity in your listening room. With any luck, the pointers here will help enhance your sound with a few relatively simple tweaks that will allow you to inhabit your own audio Nirvana.\nBefore you start moving around your speakers around your listening area, first try to figure out where you will be situated in relation to your setup. Identify the ideal listening spot\u00a0 \u2014 called the focal point or the center of the space \u2014 where the sound will be most balanced. You will want to be in the exact middle and approximately 5 to 10 feet away from your primary speakers. With two-channel arrangements in particular, it\u2019s crucial to maintain a balance between the speakers in order to give equal weight to each channel. Otherwise, you run the risk of one channel overwhelming the other, muddling sound quality and drowning out nuances in the recording.\nThe importance of symmetrical speaker placement for near field listening, especially in small to medium sized rooms, is hugely important for optimizing stereo sound quality. For the truest stereo image when setting up for a 2-channel speaker system, the pair of speakers and your head should form three points of an equilateral triangle. The listening position is determined by the \u201ccenter to center\u201d distance of the speakers from each other and the distance to the listener\u2019s ears. It does not refer to the room dimensions in any way.\nCheck 7 Quick Tips from U-Turn Audio here:https://uturnaudio.com/pages/speaker-placement\nThe \u201ctoe-in\u201d is the way you aim your speakers, and there\u2019s no specific answer to how much adjustment your specific system will require. Some speakers require none at all, but most will show notable improvements in overall sound quality and imaging when they are slightly toed-in towards your listening position. Be forewarned: too much toe-in will neutralize the stereo imaging to the point where you hear two independent speakers. It is very important that both speakers be equally toed-in.\nThe simplest way to accomplish this is with a measuring tape. It\u2019s also helpful to have a partner help with this procedure. Start by toeing the monitors one inch in. Listen to some good recordings \u2014 such as anything with a wide dynamic range \u2014\u00a0 and pay attention to the stereo imaging. Increase the toe-in to two inches and repeat. Did the sound waves become more pin-pointed and detailed? You\u2019ll want to do this several times using various measurements, depending on the types of music you listen to. Feel free to experiment. The goal is to make the sound field as life-like as possible.\nGiven their inherent size, bookshelf speakers allow for many placement options. They can be positioned on stands, put on a rack or a desk, hung from the wall or ceiling. They can even be put on an actual bookshelf. As with any speaker, try to create an equilateral triangle between the speakers and your seated position.\nBookshelf speakers are widely used in custom installations where the speakers are fitted into wall units, with excellent results, and can often provide an even richer, more full-bodied sound. Nonetheless, try to isolate your bookshelves as much as you can, leaving as much space around them as possible.\nAs with any speakers, they need room to breathe. The more space they have around them the better. Place them at least six inches out from the back wall and try to keep them away from anything that could potentially be an obstruction. The ports that are built into these things are usually in the back, which allows for the airflow that controls the speakers bass response. Giving them space will only maximize their performance.\nPro tip: bookshelf speakers should never be placed on the same rack or shelving unit as your turntable. If you do, the speakers will resonate sonically through your turntable and vibrations will play back through the speakers themselves. You do not want this. As well, because bookshelves and cabinets are usually located close to the wall, situating speakers on them will generally reduce the soundstaging and imaging performance of loudspeakers.\nGenerally these are the biggest speakers you can buy for your home. They stand somewhere between 3 and 8 feet tall and need a lot of space to get the most out of them. This usually means a larger room, as they should be given room both behind and to the sides. A good estimate is at least two feet from the back wall and a foot from the side walls. This \u201cboundary loading,\u201d as it is called, will ensure proper bass dynamics with the least amount of speaker reflection and reverberation.\nTower speakers are powerful but if they are too close to the walls they will create too much bottom end and be boomy. Not good. Speakers work in tandem (stereo), so the equilateral triangle rule remains the goal for optimum sound performance.\nThe room itself has a huge impact on sound. Rooms are constructed with a range of materials\u00a0 and each has its own distinctive sound architecture. More often than not, your listening space hasn\u2019t been designed for optimal acoustic sound dynamics. While there isn\u2019t really anything you can do with the inherent dimensions of the room, \u201croom treatments\u201d are available to make the sound in your space as good as it can be. Fortunately, furniture, rugs, curtains and even plants can help control a room\u2019s reflective echo chamber, but these things alone are not enough to properly control most listening environments. This is where \u201croom treatments\u201d come in.\nFor obvious reasons, the sound reflection off of bare hard surfaces does not resonate and is never your friend. A rug placed near the speakers or, ideally, carpeting, will sound better than hardwood or concrete floors. Carpeting will help control that bounce off the floor, and is by far\u00a0 the best way to dampen sound reflections.\nAudiophiles like to put spikes and cones under everything. They look very \u201cpro\u201d, and while they add a certain cool factor to the aesthetics equation, in many cases they do more harm than good. Plywood sub-floors are, in many ways, similar to acoustic guitars in that they can act as a resonating surface. Spiking a speaker \u2014 placing pointed \u201cfeet\u201d on the speakers \u2014 to this type of sub-flooring, whether it has hardwood, tile or carpeting, creates a large vibrating sound-box. This is especially true with subwoofers. However, spikes work wonders if you have carpet over concrete and will go a long way toward minimizing vibration and enhancing your sound.\nWalls are giant reflective surfaces. Windows, mirrors, artworks with glass frames and even your television are even worse. Furniture, bookcases, curtains, drapes, non reflective artwork and/or anything that absorbs sound and breaks up that flat wall surface will help minimize a room\u2019s reverberation and improve your acoustics in a big way. One of the other best ways to reduce this echo chamber effect is to get sound panel diffusers. Diffusers are a room treatment that breaks up the room\u2019s reflection through, as the name suggests, diffusion and sound dissipation.\nOne of the leading room treatment companies isGIK Acoustic. They offer a variety of sound solutions and can do custom orders and installations to suit your own treatment needs.\u00a0Check GIK Acoustic Panels here:https://www.gikacoustics.com/product-category/acoustic-panels/\nAll speakers and listening rooms come in all different shapes and sizes. The best way to determine how to glean the best sound from your set up in any given space is to experiment. Along with the tips provided here, be open to the idea of moving your speakers around to find the best sound for them within your listening room. Using the equilateral triangle as your baseline, there is much tweaking to be done, whether it be \u201ctoeing-in\u201d your speakers, throwing down a rug or adding some simple acoustic panelling. By trying out some of these different speaker positions and room treatment techniques, you should be able to find what sounds best for you."

        "title": "Discrete Circuits: An Interview with Condesa Electronics Founder Mehdi El-Aquil",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/interview-condesa-electronics/",
        "content": "Based in Adelaide, Australia,Condesa Electronicsin the past decade has been quietly assembling some of today\u2019s most sought-after hi-fi DJ mixers and equalizers. Crafted by hand with an emphasis on clear and present sound, Condesa takes cues from the iconic makes of the past and arguably rivals those great rotary models it\u2019s aspiring to.\nSince its humble beginnings, the boutique mixer makers have found fans in respected DJ acts such as Marcellus Pittman, Sadar Bahar, and Palms Trax. Its machines have piloted the dance world\u2019s greatest booths and facilitated intimate deep listening rooms across the globe. We had a Condesa Carmen at the In Sheep\u2019s Clothing hi-fi listening bar.\nOur conversation details Mehdi\u2019s trajectory into discrete circuits, from the small electrical bits of his youth to discovering the ultrasimple yet beautifully colored signal paths of the great seventies rotary mixers. We touch on Condesa\u2019s future, the \u201crotary cult\u201d and how desperation for a coveted sound spawned one of Australia\u2019s greatest musical exports.This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing: To dive in, I\u2019d really love to hear Condesa\u2019s \u201corigin story,\u201d how did it all start?\nMehdi: Basically, I was always interested in pulling things apart and putting them back together when I was a kid. I remember ruining some watches, wearing them in the bath (laughs), then taking them out, drying them up, and trying to get them to work again. Little remote cars and stuff. I had an interest in electronics. I was into art as well, so I wanted to be a bit creative with things. But yeah, I was obsessed with batteries, light bulbs and motors and how they could work together. I remember finding some in school. I was put in detention or something funnily enough, and I was put in a room. I was bored, I\u2019d done my lines, and I found this box with electrical bits, and I started connecting them and began playing around with that stuff.\nWhen did that evolve into building music-related equipment?\nWhen I left school, I got an apprenticeship in electronics that had nothing to do with musical stuff. I was into music, from breakdancing and electro music, how all that was mixed together.\u00a0 That really caught my imagination. I was into music and when I left school I was trying to DJ, and just you couldn\u2019t get stuff like that. The first DJ mixer I got, when I was about 17, was a Phonic DJ mixer and I had to order through a PA shop and it took ages to turn up. I had two really crap turntables, one Technics that took me a long time to save up for and I had a rubbish sort of belt-driven various speed deck, and for a long time that was my set up (laughs).\nI think growing up in that era and not having affordable DJ products made it happen. Like, you can make something. That\u2019s kinda how I got into electronics and wanting to make bits. I always had jobs in electronics like setting up sound systems. Eventually, electronics went away from average jobs and I started working on sound systems and repairing stuff. I saw a lot of how things could fail. That helped me a lot when I started building mixers myself.\nIt\u2019s funny, Ikutaro Kakehashi, who created Roland, also started with watches. I love how a lot of these respected electronic engineers all started there.\nYeah, it\u2019s amazing, maybe it\u2019s a craft thing or needing to concentrate and see how things come together on small detailed things.\nSeems like a simple entryway, for sure.\nYeah, definitely. And I think it applies to that sort of thinking in the end. Electronics was never hard for me. Like, there was just a nice overview, the same with math. I know it scares a lot of people, but I could always think of shortcuts through the numbers and ways to simplify that wasn\u2019t the \u201cofficial\u201d way to do it. So yeah, that side of things wasn\u2019t that hard. And I remember looking at electronics and seeing them, to be able to see them as blocks. \u201cThat bit is the preamp and this bit is the mixer and this bit is the output.\u201d\nWas there a mixer that you discovered in that early period that inspired you to start building your own?\nReally there\u2019s two, and it was much later running into all of this. I did electronics. I left school in \u201887 at the age of 16 and started doing an apprenticeship that took me ages to actually get that job and then I was doing electronics full stop. And at that age, I was into collecting records and attempting to DJ, I say attempting, because I mean, unlike now it seems that because of online courses and stuff, people can learn how to DJ quite quickly.\nIt took me about two years of practicing and recording mixes at home to get to some proficiency. Every day I would get up or every evening I would get back from work and mess around. Maybe sometimes it was the same four records trying to put them together, trying to work out really bad, wrong mixes (laughs). Yeah, but learning techniques. I always used to use fader mixers. And I got introduced to the idea of rotary mixers, it must have been around 2008. I was reading, looking up stuff like the history of the original discos and clubs. I did know before then the Ureis and Bozaks, I knew of them, but I never was able to put my hands on one and test it. And I remember, I got my hands on a Bozak here, for a club owner \u2014 a friend of mine that actually bought one to put in the club and I needed to service it. I listened to it and I was really impressed by the original \u201870s circuitry and how amazing it sounded. At the same time, I\u2019d been making studio equipment, I\u2019d be making clones of compressors and micro-pre\u2019s from the same era that use discrete circuitry. So I knew a lot about the circuitry and how these simpler circuits sounded so much better than a lot of the newer stuff. That blew me away.\nThat's discrete circuits versus integrated circuits?\nYeah, but that said, I also worked on an Urei 1620 as well and that sounded amazing. And that does have integrated circuits, but it has a blend of integrated circuits and discrete circuits. But the signal path, once again, is minimal. There\u2019s not much in the signal path. I remember checking a Rane scratch mixer at the time. A TM 52 or something like that. And from the beginning, from the first input to the last output, it went through, I can\u2019t remember but a ridiculous amount of operational amplifiers \u2014 27 of them in the signal path! Even though each little microchip has super good noise and distortion figures and everything else, it degrades it a tiny bit, and even if there\u2019s 27 of them they can still sound good. But when you put it against something like an Urei 1620 or an original Bozak, it\u2019s day and night.\nI'm a bit of a novice when it comes to mixer builds and circuitry, but for faders and rotaries, is there a simple way to distinguish them? Other than a smaller signal chain, and obviously the knobs versus the faders..\nI mean the knobs versus faders. But in my thinking, it\u2019s really just a different approach. Both of them are valid, I wouldn\u2019t say one is better than the other. It depends on the person. Like horses for courses, tea versus coffee, it depends on the person using it. But I think if you\u2019re making the switch, being able to put yourself forward as a DJ and say, look this is what I can do: the faders allow me to do this, this and this, and I think when you make a choice to go to rotary, you\u2019re saying hold on a second, I\u2019ll put what I can do technically aside. What I want to be first and foremost, at the front, is the best sound quality. I want it to sound as best as it can. And I think that\u2019s the distinction that rotaries versus faders usually makes. There can be fader mixers that can be as good sounding or have exactly the same circuitry as a rotary mixer. It just doesn\u2019t seem to happen as much.\nIt seems like a lot of companies are starting to make them too. Resident Advisor wrote an article a few years back called \u201cThe Cult of Rotary Mixers.\u201d What are your thoughts on the rotary boom? At the same time, it may not just be a DJ thing. There really seems to be a collective, growing desire for higher quality audio.\nWhat I used to say was, \u2018Wow, we were really lucky to start making mixers when we did, to catch this wave. This was really good.\u2019 And then I thought about it a second time and I thought, \u2018No, actually, maybe we just added some water to that wave. Maybe what we\u2019re doing at Condesa is a small part of this growth. So we\u2019ve contributed to it rather than just being lucky and being in the right place to jump on it. We\u2019re one of the companies that inadvertently helped to grow this thing. So I think it\u2019s really good. I think if anyone that\u2019s into music is going, \u2018Can I get it to sound better? Can I have the experience oflisteningto it?\u2019 It\u2019s the same in venues. If I go to a venue, so many of them are badly set up for sound.\nReally nothing worse than a great room with a terrible setup.\nHappens all the time, when you find yourself in a great venue, even if you weren\u2019t dancing, ultimately, it\u2019s the music. My thinking is, I want the music not to bash you over the head, not to drag you onto a dance floor, not to force you into anything, but to seduce you. I want the sound to be seductive. I want it to catch you. So you\u2019re like, \u2018Wow, I\u2019m going to get a bit closer to this. This is a good feeling. You know, it\u2019s not a bad feeling. It\u2019s not a hurtful feeling. It\u2019s not giving me a headache.\u2019 I mean, a lot of that counts on the source music being played, of course.\nThat\u2019s one thing with the discrete circuitry. It has a clear presence. Discrete circuitry can be as good or bad as the design, but if we go into what we make, it has clear highs. They have presence but they\u2019re not aggressive. There are so many times I\u2019m out and I hear top end, sharp, and cutting like that(stabbing motion). And it\u2019s like, Whoa. Even when you EQ it, even if you go up to the front-of-house mixer and you turn the highs down, it\u2019s still there! That aggressive top end is horrible.\nThere is a lot of bad audio out there. And if people move into rotary mixers means that they\u2019re going to a place where they\u2019re reallylistening,it can only enhance the enjoyment of the music. Another way to think about it is if a Condesa makes you, the music lover, the DJ, have a better connection to the music or the listeners have a better connection to the music then our job\u2019s done. If the connection\u2019s better \u2014 if people turn up at a venue or come to someone\u2019s house and play some records, or even\u00a0 digital that\u2019s mastered well and goes \u2018Wow. I spent my whole night really listening to stuff that I had and never realized how good it sounded, then our job\u2019s done. That\u2019s really the price of it.\nDid you happen to make it down to that Fairfield Amphitheatre show recently with Marcellus Pittman?\nI didn\u2019t! No, I didn\u2019t see it.\nI saw a few clips and the setup looked amazing. Thought you might\u2019ve had something to do with it.\nYes. I spoke to him about it. That was brilliant, used all Klipsch speakers. He\u2019s been staying over here for awhile and I\u2019ve caught up with him and Driller for dinner the other week. And I think he\u2019s back over this weekend, so I\u2019m going to go and check him on Saturday night, but yeah, the Fairfield setup looked amazing.\nThink they had La Scala's as monitors. When I saw that I was just like, oh my god.\nYes! They really went to town! I spoke to the guy who set it up and he was asking me about levels with the mixer to try and get the volumes right, too and it seemed to work really well. I heard it was an amazing vibe, really rich sound.\nDo you have any ideal speakers in mind in the design of these? I mean, it seems that Klipsch and Condesa are a perfect marriage.\nYeah, that\u2019s a nice mixture. I don\u2019t, what I would say with the Condesas, like people say, \u201cOh, it\u2019s really colored. It\u2019s really colored.\u201d But it\u2019s pretty flat. I mean, the isolator does add some peaks to the sound but there\u2019s a bypass switch. That means that the sound is quite flat. But what people don\u2019t realize is the Condesas run all the way down to 10 Hertz. So you\u2019ve got extended bass and even if you don\u2019t have bass there, you have the harmonic subsonics there that most manufacturers are rolling their bass off of 30 Hertz. They\u2019re cutting that 20 Hertz off. And I know we\u2019re only meant to hear to 20 Hertz, but it\u2019s open. I\u2019m not going to change that design but that makes a big difference if the system\u2019s set up right.\nSo full-range speakers are what I think would sound really good. I\u2019ve never had an ultimate idea, but when I hear how fast and reactive the Klipsch speakers are, they sound really good. But I also think that they do need some extra support for subsonics and modern music too, just to give it that little extra oomph if it\u2019s a dance vibe. But if it\u2019s set up in a listening room and they\u2019re in the corners of the room, they could work beautifully.\nIt really does, that's what we had in our space. Klipschorns and a Carmen.\nYeah, that looked brilliant. That setup was so amazing. I was planning to come over, but this whole covid nightmare.\nHope you guys were alright during the pandemic and were still able to operate and fulfill orders safely.\nYeah. It was weird for the first month. It was quiet, we didn\u2019t get one email and I was like, okay, all right, this is how it\u2019s going to go. Let\u2019s just batten down the hatches, catch up with what we want to do and put one foot in front of the other. And then after that, bam, the next month went crazy. It was twice the amount of orders and it\u2019s been busier than ever, ever since really.\nYeah, I feel like a lot of people turned to music during this time, started to approach it differently, and rethinking their home setups... I'm sure a lot of people sought you guys out for that.\nHave you seen people buy more vinyl and wanting to buy different, more broad music, and good home listening music?\nWe have a very humble, curated selection so it's not a great way to gauge, but I do know of a lot of people that refined their personal systems due to all of the home-time.\u00a0 Even me, I bought a.... I'm so sorry\u2026. A _____ mixer.\nThat\u2019s alright! (Laughs) That\u2019s a great mixer and actually, they\u2019re really good value. Yeah. That\u2019s amazing.\nI'm saving up for a Carmen V. You\u2019ll see my order in a few months. (laughs)\nStill, it\u2019s the same movement and I really had to think this through and it took a bit of time. Cause I think I used to feel quite a bit of pressure when new mixers and other things got introduced. And then I thought to myself, I\u2019m being really precious about this. You know, this is an open market and there are plenty of good mixer designers out there.\nHas the Condesa operation grown? Are you still building everything yourself?\nYeah, I can\u2019t build everything myself, we have help. We\u2019ve got a crew, there\u2019s about five of us which is great. Everything\u2019s done here locally in South Australia, we get the circuit boards in, we get the parts in, and the guys begin to solder and populate. Everything\u2019s done by hand, solder and populate the boards. Looms are made up. Someone draws out the wood and lines it, faceplates have controls put on, wirings put together with the circuit boards, mostly done by Dave, my right-hand man. We\u2019ll do batches of 10. Everything comes from me even if I\u2019m not building every one of them.\nI\u2019ve been really enjoying your guys\u2019 mix series. (Discrete Circuits)\nYeah, Lauren\u2019s been running that and sort of picking stuff. I know a lot of people kind of approach me and say, Oh, can I do a mix? I\u2019ve got a mix. Lauren\u2019s on quality control. So I can\u2019t undermine what she\u2019s doing. It\u2019s been a nice series. One quick thing about the mix series is our connection to, if I could use the term, the scene and DJing. Like, digging and discovering new music and discovering old music, vinyl, but also digital, all mediums \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter. But our connection to all of that is really strong. It\u2019s really an important part of it. We\u2019re not doing it to feed off of that. We\u2019re doing it because we believe we\u2019re part of it as DJs and music lovers too. I\u2019m referring to, say, maybe me, Lauren, and how the ethos of the company is, otherwise I wouldn\u2019t have made a mixer. The reason I made one is because I looked at the Ureis and Bozaks and I said, \u2018I\u2019m fucked! I can\u2019t afford one of those, and I really want one but hold on, I can make one.\u2019 That\u2019s where it all came about. Like, this is a side effect of liking the music and wanting technology that can work with the music rather than, \u2018Oh, let\u2019s make a mix series and let\u2019s infiltrate ourselves in this scene to be seen as part of it, to sell more mixers. No, forget that, we feel we\u2019re part of it.\nYeah, during those early years, was there a person, a DJ, someone you looked up to that you were really excited about who bought your mixer. Someone that made you realize, like, oh I\u2019m actually doing something pretty cool here?\nYeah. There were several. And sometimes it would just be like email inquiries. And even if they didn\u2019t follow through, there were several that really excited me and was like, \u201cWow, this is coming full circle because I\u2019ve been buying this person\u2019s records for ages. And now they\u2019re asking for a mixer. This is crazy.\u201d So it happens all the time. Even now it happens. But I guess one of the first people, was maybe Marcellus himself, he went, \u201cOh, I want a Carmen, but you need to put an isolator in it for me.\u201d\nI was always gonna do it, it was always in the cards for me to get to there, but him saying that really pushed me to go, all right, I\u2019ll get it done. And I\u2019ll do it on the strength of him asking me. That was a good, inspirational shove to get me to develop it. So, yeah, he was definitely a big one, but there have been lots of different artists and DJs that I\u2019ve looked up to now that have bought mixers. And there\u2019s sometimes I didn\u2019t even realize, and I\u2019ve seen stuff posted, Oh, that\u2019s the person that owns that label. I didn\u2019t even realize that. Wow.\nYeah, I feel like I see them everywhere.\nYeah. And I think we\u2019re looking at about a thousand mixers out there now, and next year will be 10 years, 10 years of making them.\nWow, that\u2019s great. I think we only have time for one more question, so I'll keep it pretty simple. What have you been listening to lately? Any records you wanna shout?\nYeah. So I\u2019ve been listening, I\u2019ll just show you this one actually, I\u2019ve been listening to this. This new Emanative LP that just dropped about a month ago, that\u2019s been brilliant. It\u2019s pretty jazzy, pretty laid back.\nAnd apart from that, I\u2019ve been buying a lot of older used reggae. And I just got the reissue of this African Head Charge album.\nWe're all about the On-U over here.\nYeah, like all the On-U I\u2019m working my way through it. And I also like this, album here. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve got it, you might have.Oh yeah, the new Time Capsule.Yeah, Gabrielle Roth & the Mirrors. That\u2019s beautifully recorded too. I love the sound of that.\nAnd apart from that, I\u2019ve been buying obscure bits of house music from the late eighties and nineties. Not necessarily even expensive bits, but just bits that have been sort of catching my ear and \u201cI need a copy of that.\u201d Some early British bits and pieces too. At some point I\u2019m going to put a brit funk mix together. I\u2019ve been promising my friend I\u2019ll be doing it. And I\u2019ve been, building the pile up, just stuff that sounded pretty funky and loose that started from about 78 to about 83, 1983. There was this burst of really nice jazz-funk and brit-funk. And then it sort of just disappeared as drum machines came in. So yeah, I\u2019m working on compiling this mix.Excited to hear it.\nLearn more about Condesa here:https://condesaelectronics.com/\nFollow Condesa:https://www.instagram.com/condesaelectronics/"

        "title": "Digging in the Mags: How cassette and tape culture was captured in classic ads and illustrations",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/digging-in-the-mags-cassette/",
        "content": "When Lou Ottens, who invented the cassette tape, died in March, a host of stories celebrated the life of a man who upended the music business. Ottens\u2019 device wasn\u2019t the first to capture soundwaves onto magnetic tape, but his machine checked all the boxes for what the public wanted: portability, durability and recordability. It didn\u2019t skip when you hit a bump, you could toss it in your backseat without scratching it and \u2014 most important \u2014 you could record your own music onto it.\nIts creeping success starting in the 1960s moved into the mainstream in the early 1970s. Reel-to-reel tapes were already a key component in most respectable hi-fi systems at the time, and Ottens\u2019 invention was basically a reel-to-reel \u2014 but miniaturized and encased in plastic. A similar format, the 8-track tape, was making inroads but its shortcomings were obvious. It was\u00a0 hard to record onto and longer songs were interrupted by loud clicks as the recording switched from one to length of looped tape to another.\nAudiophile magazines and their illustrators embraced the audio cassette revolution. But, then, why wouldn\u2019t they? Major manufacturers had tape decks to sell, and to do so they needed to market the nascent technology. Add in that blank tape manufacturers such as TDK, BASF and Maxell were also eager to tap the audiophile community, and an advertising boom commenced. That boom resulted in competition among various tape-driven components.\nWith tape culture continuing its decade-long renaissance, we figured we\u2019d highlight a few ads and illustrations that drove the first wave of the format.\nFew ads are as iconic as this one for Maxell tapes. \u201cSome tapes show their age more than others. And when a tape ages prematurely, the music on it does too,\u201d reads the text below this two-page spread. The problem? Poor oxide particle binding. Maxell found a solution: \u201cEven after a Maxell recording is 500 plays old, you\u2019ll swear it\u2019s not a play over five.\u201d That\u2019s impressive, yes, but more impressive is that Maxells will blow you away like this guy in chair getting pushed by\u00a0 soundwaves.\nTwo simple circles and eye-popping green ink make this ad for a 1970 National Electronics Week trade show in Chicago worthy of framing.\nAt first it\u2019s tough to parse this illustration by the impossible-to-research artist named Cork. Published in the 1970 issue of Tape Recorder magazine, your perception shifts once you realize the machine is an upside-down phono cartridge, and the guy is meant to be projecting music onto tape.\nA sound so real you\u2019d swear there was a five-piece band in your mid-1970s bedroom every time you pop a BASF into your dinky player.\nThe implication of this ad is obvious: Why interrupt a make-out session to flip your Dan Fogelberg album 20 minutes in when an Akai cassette deck can play tapes that last 45 minutes per side? Enjoy your sex for at least 25 more minutes, basically \u2014 and even more if you\u2019ve got autoplay. The Japanese company Akai was a leader in tape deck components, and a few of their models from the 1970s remain in demand.\nThis illustration from a 1971 stereo buyers guide captures that moment when cassette decks, reel-to-reel players and 8-track tapes were all vying for a spot in your component chain.\nThis 1971 ad for BASF tape is simple and effective: flowers, first love, birds, stars, sunshine, two-toned rainbows and \u2026 tape.\nA classic and professional advertisement for TDK, which competed with Maxell for market dominance throughout the cassette era. Note: This was published during the Watergate era, when the discussion of taping systems in Richard Nixon\u2019s White House was part of the national dialogue."

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/hi-fidelity-illustrations-1970s/",
        "content": "If you were lucky enough to be a music freak who could also illustrate, in the 1960s and \u201870s you could actually earn a living from working the hi-fi magazine circuit. After all, there are only so many ways to photograph a Marantz, McIntosh or JBL component, and with advertising money pouring in art budgets were fat.\nBecause of the nature of advertising and magazine work, the names of many of these for-hire illustrators have been lost to time, but their loving, occasionally cheeky depictions of gear and the listeners getting lost within it endure.\nBelow, a few illustration highlights from Stereophile, High Fidelity and other glossy magazines of the era.\nTaken from a 1977 advertisement for Pickering cartridges and styli, this illustration identifies \u201cStylus Carnivorous,\u201d a pest that \u201cmay look cute but he\u2019s a nasty little creature. He shows up when the stylus in your phonograph begins to wear.\u201d\nThe early 1970s saw the arrival of the first successful mass-market format since the LP: the cassette. Before its adaptation by component makers, cruising music was dictated by radio DJs. Cassettes changed the game, and the result was a huge push in the marketplace.\nOne of the major innovations of the golden hi-fi era was in stereo separation and amplification. Hellbent on exploring the capacities and engineering potential of room-filling sound, writers reported on innovations \u2014 and illustrators tried to capture ways of manifesting those ideas.\nMixing photos and illustrations, Harman Kardon\u2019s 1977 ad for its straight line tracking turntable the ST7 explains through similar images why the technology was deemed superior when it was introduced. The market spoke, however: few manufacturers make linear tracking turntables anymore.\nIf you look closely at the cover to this primer on hi-fi, you can see the canvas upon which the anonymous illustrator painted the original. With bold colors and a simple, brilliantly conveyed idea, the image pops off the page.\nBy the mid \u201870s, Marantz was so successful that they could apparently commission artists to drop a lot of acid, put on some tunes and start painting. This 1975 ad compares its competitors\u2019 flat sound to Marantz\u2019s more hallucinogenic energy.\nWho is this man, and why does he look like he\u2019s getting ready to go bartend at a saloon? Why isn\u2019t he sitting in front of the speakers? Whoever he is \u2014 and where are the speaker wires? \u2014 the ad campaign didn\u2019t hurt. Frazier Inc. is still in business making boutique speakers, part of Mitchell Acoustic Research."

        "title": "Thorens TD-160: A Classic, Floating Chassis Turntable from the 70\u2019s",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/thorens-td-160/",
        "content": "The famed Thorens TD-160 is pretty much unparalleled when it comes to classic vintage turntables models. The Swiss clock company first launched its phonograph division back in 1903 when much of the world didn\u2019t even know what a turntable was. That changed in 1928 when Thorens produced their first electric (motor-driven) record player and quickly became one of the most heralded phonograph machine manufacturers in the world.\nHoning their craft over the years, the company went on to develop an entire range of audiophile record players in the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s. In 1965, building on the suspension chassis design of Acoustic Research\u2019s XA model, they created their first suspended table, the Thorens TD-150. The entry level TD-160 would be introduced in 1972 and go on to become the company\u2019s most popular seller, with its manufacturing and production continuing pretty much nonstop for the next two decades. It was the apex of the 1970\u2019s hi-fi boom and there was no shortage in demand for these specialized audiophile units.\nBeing at the right place and time may have helped Thorens make its mark in the audio fidelity world, but this relatively affordable and well appointed turntable has since become a thing of legend. Considered by many the gold standard by which other turntables are judged, the TD-160 has endured.\nThe good news? Because so many were made back in the day, anyone looking to find a working model or parts for one will have little trouble finding one on the aftermarket.\nA lot of thought went into the stability within the design of this machine, making it an exceptionally quiet playing unit. At the basic level, the TD-160 is in fact a minimal yet stylistically handsome record playing machine. With its sturdy (usually) wooden-framed plinth and stance, it exudes stability and commands respect as part of any hi-fi set up based on its aesthetics alone.\nSimple in theory but technical in its construction, the Thorens TD-160 is a belt driven turntable with a floating sub-chassis suspended by three adjustable springs. The sub-chassis carry the main bearing via a mounting platform for its pickup arm. Which means that the turntable platter and arm are both rigidly coupled to a common sprung chassis, making them entirely independent of the plinth. When adjusted correctly, this innovative design ensures exceptional isolation from feedback and plays a vital role in the fidelity of the deck.\nThe sub-chassis and suspension construction allows a lower center of gravity, and because the mass stabilization of the sub-chassis and outer frame are so well balanced, the entire system is untethered from almost anything that might make noise and vibrations. The build quality on these things is fantastic. If properly maintained and cared for, a Thorens can last a lifetime or two of pure listening enjoyment.\nTo this day, the Thorens TD-160 is the deck of choice for turnable enthusiasts who are seeking a collectable piece of audiophile history that will provide amazing sound quality from a solidly made unit built to last.\nAnd make no mistake, it is a superb turntable in its stock format. But what really drives people to the TD-160 is its ability to be modified, improved and adjusted.\nIf trying out a new tone arm (straight or curved) for more sensitive tracking is your thing, have at it. The suspension springs can be entirely switched out or merely leveled on the TD-160, making for an overall smoother vibration dampening dynamic. Leveling a turntable is also crucial. An evenly leveled turntable has as much influence over the sound performance of your unit as any of its individual parts. Some ambitious audiophilers have even been known to change out the entire motor system within the machine to achieve a quieter running performance.\nOne of the most common modifications is building a custom plinth, the foundation of the turntable, which serves to improve isolation as well as the aesthetics of the turntable. Another common mod is, of course, replacing or switching between cartridge headshells or styli. Whether it be a moving magnet (MM), moving coil MC or a mono cartridge, swapping out can be quite easily achieved for an improved \u2014 or just different \u2014 sound dynamic.\nThe internet is dense with information, manuals and step by step instructions; with a little (or, okay, a lot) of patience, you can learn how to make these tweaks yourself. Whether you want to simply change the belt on your platter to keep consistent rotation speed or change out the unit\u2019s entire plinth, you can do it with the Thorens.\nhttp://www.thorens.com\nhttp://www.qaudio.comhas genuine Thorens replacement belts with the Thorens Logo.\nhttp://electricwarriorturntables.com/buying-a-thorens-td-160/Great resource on what you should know before buying a Thorens TD-160.\nhttp://www.analogue-classics.com/English language site, written by Holger Trass in Germany, with info on many collectible Thorens turntables.

        "title": "The Art of Japanese Portable Record Players",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/japanese-portable-record-players/",
        "content": "Portable technology has always been an essential part of humanity. Whether a stone tool or\u00a0cellular phone, there\u2019s an undeniable enjoyment that comes with being able to carry your favorite device anywhere. Vinyl is no exception. When it became possible to have a recorded copy of your favorite song, it was only a matter of time before engineers and designers created\u00a0record players as easy to carry around as the records themselves.\nManufacturers in Japan including Toshiba, Columbia and Takt led the way with an array of designs in the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s to accompany this novel new phenomenon. Collector Fumihito Taguchi recently helped preserve and share these marvels of design by showcasing more than a hundred portable Japanese made players in anexhibit and bookreleased last year. This selection of players brings together a few found in thebookplus a few other noteworthy favorites.\nTakt brand record players were made by Tomikura Electric, and these turntables come in some of the most impressive colors and minimalist designs. The TP-880 had a stunning walnut trim and was Tact\u2019s premium player. This solid state machine had AM radio and a sleek look that was less playful than other models they carried. The tone arm nests in a concave nook and is held down by tension clasp that protects your needle. The cover for this one isn\u2019t shown here, but it\u2019s transparent, which means the design is always in view.\nThe TP-5 plays both 7-inch and 12-inch records. Its simple lines and bold use of colors runs through many of the company\u2019s other models. The speakers are comparable to other mid-range portable players, and the video just below demonstrates what it sounds like.\nThis tiny ultra portable turntable could almost fit in a back pocket, and most definitely in a school bag for recess time jams. The tone arm is on a spring that can be pushed flush with the body of the unit, and the metal speaker grill makes this model small and durable.\nThis stunning player integrates a 23 key electric piano that\u2019s perfect for playing along to your favorite tune. It plays both 7-inch and 12-inch records, and has a speaker that\u2019s small but mighty.\nThis player has a beautiful perforated metal grate for the speaker that would look great poolside. You can easily switch to AM radio or, if you need a bit more oomph, connect it to your favorite pair of speakers.\nOn this three-piece set-up, you can sequence your favorite tracks without the threat of the dead air that happens when flipping over a record. It even features a pitch fader for the aspiring picnic DJ. It can fit both 7-inch and 12-inch vinyl comfortably and the platter automatically spins when the tone arm is lifted. The audio quality is impressively solid for a small player, as evidenced in the video below.\nThis Columbia model is perfect for those who have a mix of tapes in their music collection. A hearty three-speed player accommodates 7-inch, 10-inch and 12-inch records, its larger profile houses a powerful speaker. It was made as a light standalone media player and has a suitcase handle for maximum utility.\nLeave it to the 80\u2019s to turn convention on its head with these vertically playing turntables. Out of any of the players on this list, this without a doubt has the best functional design for spinning, but it\u2019s also the only one without a speaker attached. It seems to have been designed so it looks like it would digitally read the record, but this is a fully analog device with a linear tracking needle similar to your average horizontal player. The body of the device is about the size of a VHS. But perhaps the best feature of these players are the matching booming speakers that were sold separately. You can listen to these unique objects via the video below.\nThe KP-747F is definitely for a more sophisticated bunch. It\u2019s the only portable player on the list that allows for tone adjustment and it\u2019s also the lone player that can play FM radio. It plays all three standard speeds and has a metal encasement that makes this one perfect for camping or any activity that would require extra durability.\nThe GP-55 was more of a toy for children, and it sports many of the standard features of the other players such as AM radio and basic speed adjustments.\nThis tiny player is meant for an equally tiny human, and this toy machine could play 7-inch and 12-inch records. The sound wouldn\u2019t be exactly satisfying to a music lover, though if you\u2019re a child you couldn\u2019t start playing vinyl on anything more adorable. We call this one \u201cBaby\u2019s first record player.\u201d"

        "content": "Fifty years ago when magazines were the dominant source of information on listening and hi-fi culture, the demand for the latest news on gear, technology and advances in stereophonic sound reproduction sparked fierce competition among publishers looking to connect advertisers with buyers.\nMagazines including Audio, Stereophile and High Fidelity targeted a generation with disposable income and a fierce love of listening to music. Dense with brands promoting then-fresh, covetable gear that a half-century later inspires both wonder and desire, the publications employed full-time reporters, editors, designers and illustrators whose monthly mission was to enlighten the massive American middle class on the wonders of stereophonic listening.\nThough they didn\u2019t realize it would at the time, this writing and these ads on the ins and outs of high-fidelity remain an incredible resource to those curious about the history of the technology driving quality sound.\nBelow, some choice advertisements from the peak hi-fi era.\nWhat kind of people don\u2019t use a Marantz in their system? \u201cBlah people. Middle-of-the-road-people who only listen to the midrange because their power amplifier DISTORTS the high and low frequencies,\u201d that\u2019s who. Judging by the volume of ads that the company placed throughout the 1970s, Marantz\u2019s campaigns worked. Hundreds of thousands of various models were sold, which is why so many remain in circulation.\nHere\u2019s a tip from a smart commenter on the Klipsch website re: securing a secondhand pair of\u00a0 Belle Klipsch speakers: \u201cIf you live near a college campus, knock on fraternity doors and ask, \u2018Do you have any old house speakers sitting in the basement?\u2019 Back in the \u201870\u2019s these things were favorite party speakers in fraternity houses from coast to coast, usually in unfinished oak veneer cabinets. Even if the cabinets are soaked in 40 years of spilled beer & barf, they are worth owning. Rescue them! Refinish them and put them in your audio room.\u201d\nThe early 1970s saw manufacturers bet big on cassette technology. Unlike the front-loaded components that became standard in the 1980s, most decks from the 1960s and \u201870s are designed to be top-loaded. This ad references the noise-reduction technology Dolby, a patented process that eliminates high-end hiss \u2014 but also reduces detail.\nThese little JBL beasts cost $300 new and on the used market now go for three times that. Gorgeous and powerful \u2014 \u201cTwo Lancer 55s and your 10-watt amplifier can get you evicted,\u201d the ad boasts \u2014 the speaker was designed with a smoked glass top, a hand-rubbed, oiled walnut finish and three color options for the speaker fabric.\nNot only is Garrard considered the most desirable turntable brand, their ads were miniature lectures on achieving quality sound. Read the text and tell us you don\u2019t want to dip into your savings and splurge.\nNeed graphics ideas? Glossy stereo magazines hired fantastic print designers and illustrators. Here\u2019s one example as a teaser to a future post on hi-fi graphics."

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/solid-state-vs-tube/",
        "content": "When committing to hi-fi audio gear you\u2019re going to have a lot of choices, and among the most crucial is whether you\u2019ll be looking for a tube or solid state amplifier.\nFor decades, this enduring debate within the audiophile community has divided fanatics into two camps. As with all aesthetic arguments \u2014 Beatles vs. Stones? Biggie or Tupac? \u2014 ultimately it comes down to taste as to whether tube amps or solid state/transistor amps offer a more precise document of the studio session. Both approaches generate a similar result: quality audio reproduction. But they do sound different.\nDeclaring, as many gearheads do, that tube amps will bring you more joy is akin to arguing that a vinyl copy of a record will always sound better than a digital source. Anyone who\u2019s purchased a poorly mastered new release on wax knows that\u2019s not necessarily the case. At best, vinyl delivers a depth and sonic richness that CDs don\u2019t\u00a0 attain. But lossless digital files can sound more accurate and, when remastered correctly, more precise than a record. Comparing solid state and tube amplification prompts similar conversations.\nAs a way to help you make more informed decisions, what follows is a primer on the differences between tube and solid state amps.\nWhen comparing the sound of tube versus solid state amplifiers, take into consideration that these machines work in different ways to generate their sound output. Solid State amps are driven by current throughout the output\u2019s devices. They typically have only one power transformer, and utilize silicon with current.\nTube amps, by contrast, are driven by voltage and as such need output transformers. If you\u2019re looking at, for example, a Luxman- SQ-N150 integrated tube amp, these transformers are the three large, heavy, black square-looking objects located in the rear of a tube amp. They convert the voltage from the output tubes to current that runs through wires and into the speakers to create sound. The tube amp gets its power through glass vacuum tubes with voltage.\nSilicon transistor-based amplification technology has come a long way over the years. Listeners who prefer the sound of solid state often cite their \u2018clean,\u2019 more detailed sound. Solid state amps can be more robust, durable and power efficient than their tube counterparts. They tend to offer more watts-per-dollar, so to speak, and can pretty much blow tube equipment out of the listening room in terms of sheer power. Bass control, say proponents, is tighter and allows for faster gain control \u2014 which results in a more immediate punch and overall presence to the music.\nThe sound of music played through silicon transistors is crisp and technically more accurate. So much so in fact, that higher-end solid state equipment will give you music replication playback that is as close to original source as is possible, minus any sound coloration. And because the \u2018noise-floor\u2019 with transistors is close to nil at 0.005hd (harmonic distortion), they provide an almost distortionless listening experience. This is one reason why electronic and classical music enthusiasts often prefer solid state over tubes.\nIt doesn\u2019t hurt that you can get a lot of sound for your buck going the transistor amp route these days; they\u2019re a great option for the audiophile on a budget. That said, detractors argue that solid state sound can be sterile, brittle and even harsh compared to the warmth that tube amps can provide. This brittleness, critics say, can lead to sound clipping at high volumes and listening fatigue.\nSome find the transparency and accuracy of transistor amplification counter productive. Tube fans suggest that since many recordings aren\u2019t precisely engineered and mastered, allowing for a more forgiving and rounder sound can smooth out the music.\nVacuum tube amplification has been around for more than a century and is still regarded by many as the best way to achieve sound excellence. Also known as valve amps, fans argue that tube amps sound sweeter, with a warmer and smoother sound. They add more texture and realism to vocals and instruments and deliver a richer, fuller mid-range than traditional silicon transistors amps.\nTube enthusiasts cite the \u2018holographic effect\u2019 as a central draw. An apt description of holographic sound is to imagine yourself walking around the singer and having the ability to hear each performer individually as the music played \u2014 as well as the space between them. Every detail of the acoustic guitar and every snare hit creates its own bubble, resulting in more layered, virtually three-dimensional sound.\nIn addition to the organic natural sound that vacuum tubes deliver, tubes can be swapped out and customized to a listener\u2019s liking, a term known as \u2018tube rolling.\u2019 To achieve a desired feel tubes are replaced with warmer sounding, and sometimes larger, tubes of better quality. They\u2019re often imported from Japan or China, and the process can become an expensive hobby. But it\u2019s part of the fun for hi-fi enthusiasts and music professionals alike, many of whom are continually chasing the elusiveperfect soundfrom their systems.\nOne downside with tubes is that they can put off a slightly audible hum. At low volume this can add to the noise floor of your listening experience. But this minor harmonic distortion is easily combated by volume adjustment. And while tubes are held in very high regard, they are fragile music conduits not unlike lightbulbs. They can burn out or even break, and need to be replaced from time to time.\nStill, most tubes will play for more than 10,000 hours (about 10 years) without any trouble at all. They do \u2018run hot\u2019 at times and can even heat up a room once in a while \u2014 a nice bonus for a frigid day \u2014 but keep the small children and house pets away. That said, most quality tube amps are encased in a cage that covers up and protects the valves.\nAre you a tube person or a solid state person? To figure it out, determine the sound you\u2019re seeking based on listening habits and what kind of music you like. Do your research. Test and demo equipment when possible and always ask questions. Countless resources are available online and any reputable specialist at an audio retailer should be able to guide you.\nIn the end, all that matters is connecting as closely as possible to the music itself and building a relationship with the art \u2014 whatever the engine that drove us there.\nReisong- A12 Integrated Vacuum Tube Amplifier \u2013 $500.00\nA relaxed sounding entry-level tube amp that will bring excellent midrange and transparent depth to your listening experience.\nLine Magnetic 34IA- Integrated Tube Amplifier- $1999.00\nThis handmade, push-pull tube-integrated amplifier employs point-to-point wiring and high quality capacitors to deliver dynamic natural sound.

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/oswalds-mill-audio-fleetwood-sound-company/",
        "content": "When Jonathan Weiss first laid eyes on the old stone Oswalds Mill building in the wilds outside of Allentown, Pennsylvania in New Tripoli, he knew it was the perfect location to create his dream sound factory. Built in the early 1800\u2019s, the loft-like, four-story open structure contained more than 10,000 square feet of workspace and had thick stone walls.\nThere were no immediate neighbors, so the spot was secluded enough to make as much noise as he would need to set up shop. So after buying the building in 1998, Oswalds Mill Audio (OMA) was born. Weiss wasn\u2019t setting out to construct just another stereo equipment factory. Instead, this would become his high fidelity sound laboratory \u2014 the Willy Wonka\u2019s Chocolate Factory of stereophonic sound design and manufacturing.\nHis mantra?\u00a0 \u201cMusic is an event, not a soundtrack.\u201d And at ISC Hi-Fi, we couldn\u2019t agree more.\nBridging vintage audio technology with the latest engineering techniques, Weiss relied on his own sound philosophy of old world craftsmanship to realize his innovative high end audio speakers, amplifiers, turntables and stereo furniture. Many characteristics set OMA apart from other brands making state-of-the-art audio gear today, but what makes this brand special is the outstanding acoustic performance of their uniquely designed cone-shaped horn speakers.\nUsing a special process, OMA thermally changes the nature of their wood by roasting it \u2014 akin to making coffee beans. This heat exposure changes the chemical structure and organic properties of the wood, making it more stable and a better conduit for the sound waves traveling out of it. Weiss\u2019 design features \u201cconical horns with straight walls\u201d which allows soundwaves to travel directly to the listener (as opposed to conventionally-designed curved tube speakers that dissipate sound). This innovation minimizes distortion and allows for a more accurate, uncolored soundfield.\nThe directivity of the horn is also crucial: there\u2019s no encumbrance when waves exit the driver. With less constriction, the speakers are far more efficient. Weiss likens this effect to a megaphone.\n\u201cThe conical shape allows the sound to go where you want it to go, and you don\u2019t have to shout. With a box speaker design you will have to shout or, put another way, crank the volume up unnecessarily. It\u2019s all about efficiency,\u201d he says.\nThe details are fantastic. OMA\u2019s are ported two different ways: from underneath or the front. This allows the listener to be able to virtually place the speakers anywhere. Sure, every room has different dimensional configurations, which will inevitably result in acoustic challenges. But it\u2019s nice to know that wherever you put these speakers you\u2019ll be pleased with how they sound.\nWeiss\u2019 passion stems from his time spent working at a theater when he was 14. He could never get over the sound emanating from the 2-meter-tall, horn-loaded Altec loudpeakers, which were\u00a0 powered by vintage tube amplifiers that projected sound over the cavernous auditorium. There was a directness and purity to it, he told me.\nVolume seemed to completely envelope the theater. Because the horn-loaded speakers channelled the sound in a particular direction with force but minus strain, its presence was unlike anything he had ever heard before.\n\u201cPeople not only forgot what great sound reproduction sounded like, but even to this day most have never even heard it,\u201d he said. Weiss set out to advance sound reproduction while drawing on his own past and designed his own version of a speaker with cone-shaped horn tweeters.\n\u201cUltimately, it\u2019s about harmonic resonance,\u201d he added, and the wooden horns have everything to do with creating that.\nWhile this company is clearly Weiss\u2019 vision, he had the wisdom to hire acoustical engineer Bill Woods, a renowned expert in horn amplification who had already been engineering\u00a0 loudspeakers for more than 35 years. Industrial designer David D\u2019Imperio was tasked with creating a design aesthetic \u2014 while maintaining the strict parameters of acoustic integrity. With an ample supply of sustainable ash and walnut in the surrounding Pennsylvania forestland, Weiss enlisted a few local master wood craftsmen from the nearby Knoll furniture factory.\nAcross the board, the bespoke nature of these individually handcrafted speakers make them\u00a0works of art. They\u2019re also some of the best sounding speakers money can buy. The company\u2019s Imperia model cost about as much as a really nice sports car.\nIt\u2019s true: the OMA line may not be within reach for every budget. That said, the company has recently created a sister company, Fleetwood Sound Co., that produces a DeVille speaker with the same build quality and sound philosophy, but at a much more accessible price point, relatively speaking: depending on the finish (check the finishes here), price ranges from $9,600 to $18,600.\nhttps://oswaldsmillaudio.com\nhttps://fleetwoodsound.com"

It converts the physical movement of the stylus into electrical signals to pass on to the pre-amplifier.\nResponse range, clarity on musical peaks, tonal balance, stereo separation and imaging, along with freedom from noise and distortion, are all affected by the phono cartridge. As you move up to higher performance models, the diamond shape of the needle attached to the cartridge itself actually changes to afford increased contact area deeper within the grooves. While we are talking about fractions of milligrams here, those smaller details and that information within the grooves are there for the amplifying, so why wouldn\u2019t you try to?\nAn upgraded stylus can further articulate what you hear and just how incredible a particular pressing of record truly is. Notes bite through with a more pronounced feel. Perhaps even more important, cartridges strongly affect the life of your records. With rarities becoming more and more difficult to replace, it\u2019s an important point to keep in mind.\nThe stylus or \u2018needle\u2019 is the small pointed piece on the end of the cartridge that makes direct contact with your record and tracks the indentations and imprinted \u2018sound waves\u2019 in the record\u2019s grooves. Styli are usually made of diamond but sometimes sapphire, with lower quality needles being \u201cdiamond-tipped\u201d and higher quality pieces being all diamond (also called \u2018nude diamond\u2019).\nThe ideal is having a diamond shaped as closely as possible to the original cutting stylus. In order of quality, expense and ability to pick up detail, styli will usually be shaped as conical (spherical), elliptical, hyperelliptical (fine line), or micro-ridge. Stylus shapes and manufacturing quality vary widely, and can range in price from $15 to more than $30,000.00\nThere are two main types of phono cartridges, moving-magnet (MM) and moving-coil (MC). These two designs are crafted and constructed differently and their performance can vary dramatically.\nMoving Magnet (MM)\nMM cartridges convert vibrations into audio signals by having a magnet attached to the cantilever, which then vibrates in close proximity to a pair of coiled wires. When the tiny magnets positioned between the two coils are activated, they produce a small electrical current. With a MM cartridge, the magnet vibrates and the coils do not.\nWhile the engineering and physics with both types or cartridges are quite technical, the basic deal is that MM cartridges are significantly easier to make but less sensitive and deliver a less accurate signal. There\u2019s a good chance that if you own an entry level turntable you have MM cartridge on your player. The good news is that MM cartridges are more forgiving and versatile and are compatible with more turntables and external phono preamps. MM are also much easier to replace in case of damage.\nMoving Coil (MC)\nA MC cartridge does the opposite, mechanically, to what an MM does. The coils move and the magnet does not. With an MC, the coil wires are attached to the vibrating cantilever, which then vibrates a fixed magnet. MC cartridges, while far more finicky, are the \u2018go to\u2019 choice for listeners willing to stop at nothing in the pursuit of the best playback quality. Moving coils deliver an accuracy the MM cartridges simply cannot.\nThese devices are painstakingly built by hand and rarely, if ever, mass produced. This precision handcrafting requires a skilled technician, using a microscope, to wind a precise number of coils.\u00a0 Every cartridge is then run through a gamut of performance tests before it leaves the factory. All this significantly drives up the manufacturing cost. But if you have audiophile aspirations and are looking for the best sound possible from your turntable, a MC Cartridge is for you.\nA high output MC cartridge achieves its increased output by including more turns of wire in the coil, and with more turns you\u2019ll get more voltage. The cartridge uses more wire attached to the cantilever as a way to increase inertia. For superior performance, you need to properly track the high frequencies, which change the direction of the needle thousands of times per second. You might also need a more sensitive phono preamp to fully tap the potential. Predictably, all of this is more expensive. But it gives you the absolute best performance.\nStill, in most cases, lower output MM cartridges are more favorable as they require fewer turns of wire and are generally considered to give a more consistent sound quality. They\u2019re also likely to be cheaper and easier to work with.\nLet\u2019s repeat this for emphasis: The performance potential of your turntable is most defined by the capabilities of the phono cartridge. Response range, tonal balance, clarity on musical peaks, stereo separation and imaging, and freedom from noise and distortion \u2014\u00a0 all are affected by these diminutive devices. Cartridges fitted to most common turntables should serve you well in general, but if you\u2019re looking for a quick way to upgrade your vinyl listening experience, upgrading your phone cartridge is a great place to start.\nBelow we\u2019ve included a list of cartridges that we recommend across all price levels.\nOrtofon 2M Blue \u2013 (MM) $225\nA definite step up from the Ortofon 2M Red in terms of its sound sensitivity. Adds more dynamics and resolution and has a more \u201copen\u201d sound. It\u2019s also a great value for the money.\nDenon DL-103 (MC) Cartridge $299\nDenon\u2019s basic 103 is excellent value and possibly the best cartridge you can get at this price point. Sounding very smooth and musical, it delivers a classic \u201cold fashioned\u201d sound (in the best way).\nMoFi Electronics \u2013 UltraTracker (MM) $499\nThis high-output MM uses the same layout as the cutting head responsible for making the grooves on MoFi records. The physical configuration is hand built in Japan and extracts immense amount of detail, dynamics, tone and texture from LP\u2019s.\nGrado Sonata 2 Low Output (MC) $600\nA wood chassis cartridge with optimized mass distribution designed for improved audio stability\u00a0and imaging. For the discriminating listener.\nClear Audio Artist V2 Ebony (MM) $650\nA high output cartridge with a ton of dynamic range and a super balanced response.\nHANA- SL Shibata Cartridge \u2013 Low Output (MC)\u00a0$750.00\nA brilliant and gorgeous sounding Japanese cartridge. The Hana brand is known for its supreme transparency and excellent trackability.\nNagaoka MP-500 (MM) $950\nAnother Japanese-made favorite. One of Stereophile\u2019s \u201ceditor\u2019s top picks,\u201d the Nagaoka MP-500 offers the highest musical and creative expression of the brand\u2019s new MP series. It expertly extracts and reproduces with vivid, colorful and dimensional clarity what others miss.\nEMT TSD 15\u00a0(MC) ~ $1500\nThe cornerstone of the celebrated German EMT line, the TSD 15 has been used in recording studios and radio stations throughout Europe for over 50 years. The TSD 15 delivers with robustness and equal parts finesse and resolution coupled to excellent dynamics, a truly fast delivery of the notes and a \u2018live\u2019 character.\nSoundsmith \u2013 The Voice Ebony MI(Moving Iron)\u2013 High Output \u00a0$3000\nA high-output moving coil cartridge, the Voice Ebony from Soundsmith is faster, smoother and more sonically enhanced than almost anything out there. Recognized industry-wide, it\u2019s won numerous hi-fi product-of-the-year trophies for this unparalleled sound performance."

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/mid-century-hifi-designs/",
        "content": "Aiming to add simplicity to our lives by shunning maximalism, mid-century designers experimented with the concept of \u201cform follows function\u201d in almost every aspect of the design of daily life. It\u2019s no surprise that many venerated mid-century architects and designers got in on reimagining what at-home listening could look like. Notable names like Charles and Ray Eames, Dieter Rams\u00a0and Franco Albini, all explored hi-fi design with stunning results. Below we\u2019ve included a list of seven mid-century designs that may change how you think of the physical instruments behind deep listening.\nHusband and wife team Charles and Ray Eames are perhaps the most famous for their signature chairs, and in 1956 Stephens Tru-sonic asked the Eames office to redesign a series of speaker enclosures. Naturally, they\u00a0 employed design elements they favored, including the curved radial design they used for their iconic lounge chair. The team centered their designs on the people they were meant for, with curved corners to prevent injury during the day-to-day at home. The circular plastic grill cover was envisioned to replace cloth covers, which collected dust and were difficult to clean. This Is why their friend, architect Bill Lacey would say, \u201cThere is no Eames style, there is just a legacy problem beautifully solved.\u201d\nDieter Rams shaped the design of the German appliance company Braun via\u00a0 his steadfast philosophy, \u201cweniger, aber besser\u201d which translates as \u201cless, but better.\u201d And Rams\u2019 work still greatly influences contemporary companies like Apple because of his specific focus on consumer goods. As head of design at Braun for over 30 years, Rams elegantly designed everything from toasters to record players. When Rams took on hi-fi equipment, he wanted the visual language to speak to the clarity of sound. The Braun LE-1 in 1959 was the first electrostatic mode loudspeaker available on the German hi-fi market, and the wide span and slim profile was meant to symbolize the clarity of its sound. It was set on a stand that was at a tilt, which enabled home users to maximize the sonic profile of the unit. It was the first speaker that was raised on a thin metal base, which was meant to make the speaker appear to almost float.\nThe next speaker, the L-2, looked like Rams\u2019 take on the Eames design. It was also typified by starkfully minimalist design reminiscent of fine artists like Piet Modrian, who was also fascinated by simple geometric elements. Rams was on a continual search for universal values in aesthetics, which is perhaps why his work remains relevant more than 50 years later.\nThe classic JBL Paragon\u2019s production run was the longest of any of the company\u2019s speakers. Manufactured from 1957 to 1983 as the first mass-produced stereo loudspeaker for home use, and it was JBL\u2019s flagship product. It was also the most expensive speaker in the world at the time at\u00a0 $1,830, which, adjusted for inflation, equates to over $15,000 today. It\u2019s still highly sought after. One in decent shape goes for about $30,000 now.\nIts wooden sculptural shape was imagined by JBL industrial designer Arnold Wolf from a concept elaborated by electrical engineer Richard Ranger. One early issue of stereophonic sound was addressing that the stereo image \u2014 the direction sound travels in the room \u2014 only provided a single auditory sweet spot. The Paragon successfully mitigated this by reflecting the sound on curved wood surfaces. That, in turn, would refract the sound far more broadly into the room.\nIts stately design is still celebrated today and at nine feet wide, it is the centerpiece of any room it\u2019s in.\nThe stereo cabinet that Franco Albini designed for his own house was made as a pushback against the ordinariness of mass produced objects. The transparent enclosure is meant to symbolize it\u2019s separation from the physical world and spoke to the time it was produced in 1938, just a few years before the accepted start of the mid-century period. Italy was under the grip of the fascist prime minister Benito Mussolini and the country was trudging forward towards World War II. This was the first design of its kind, and is one of the most impressive designs by Albini.\nThe RR126 was one of the most famous designs in the history of Italian home stereo, and became a status symbol as soon as it was released in 1966. Its modular speakers could be hung on either side of the record player or disconnected to sit on the floor or any surface. Though it was beautifully symmetric, minimalism was not the factor that set the RR126 apart from the others on this list. Quite the opposite. This unit was anthropomorphized with volume dials for eyes and speakers for ears.\nThe stereo system is still being produced by Brionvega and all by hand, though the vintage units are more highly valued. That\u2019s no surprise; it\u2019ll make any room look like the set of a 60\u2019s italian thriller.\nOnly 400 Project G units were made between 1964-1967, and the brand quickly became a celebrity favorite. Frank Sinatra, Hugh Hefner, Oscar Peterson and others owned them, and consequently they popped up on the sets of movies including The Graduate, The Party and Zabriskie Point.\nIt was a breakthrough design that integrated traditional wooden encasements and saddled it with two omnidirectional speakers that look like futuristic orbs. Though everyone wanted one, the price made it relatively inaccessible. They retailed for $2,000 (about $20,000 in today\u2019s money).\nReleased in 1968, this high-end audio loudspeaker is unusual even compared to others on this list. It looks more like a screen door than an audio device. If you\u2019ve ever taken off the protective mesh screen of a speaker, you\u2019ll likely see a conical piece that drives the sound production. Mangepan instead opted for a flat planar driver system that was mounted on a panel, and since it didn\u2019t require depth of a cone, it dramatically reduced its profile.\nThe Mangepan MG-II was also bi-directional, with the back panels sending sound waves into the wall behind the unit, which would then reflect the sound into the room. Whether this innovation was effective is still debated, but with plenty of consumers who bought into the novelty, Mangepan units were plentiful so they\u2019re not hard to find."

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/mofi-audiophile-recordings/",
        "content": "If you\u2019ve stepped into a reputable record store or stereo dealer in the past 30 years, you\u2019ve been around them. If anybody you know collects records, you\u2019ve seen them. If you have any audiophile friends, chances are you\u2019ve listened to a few. And if you are a music fanatic that cherishes amazing sound quality, then you most likely own a few of them yourself.\nWe\u2019re talking about Mobile Fidelity Original Master Series recordings. They\u2019re easily identified by the bold color strip running across the top of the album cover with italicized block letters reading ORIGINAL MASTER RECORDING.\nMobile Fidelity Sound Labs, known to collecting geeks as MoFi, has been putting out records since 1977, but the company was founded about a decade earlier by sound recording engineer Brad Miller. His passion at the time was for capturing what he called \u201cfield recordings.\u201d (This is where the \u201cM\u201d in \u201cMobile\u201d comes from.) With little more than a microphone and 8-track recorder in hand, starting in the 1960s Miller recorded the atmospheric sounds of thunderstorms, locomotive steam trains and other environmental utterances. Stereo sound recording was gaining popularity, and Miller realized that by panning his captured sounds left to right and combining them together, he was creating a sound field and depth not yet captured on record.\nAfter meeting up with fellow audio enthusiast and disc jockey Gary Geogi in Washington state, the two began collaborating on how to get stereo music recordings onto vinyl that sounded as good as Brad\u2019s field recordings. This research led them to Stan Ricker in Hollywood, who had been working on a \u201chalf speed mastering process.\u201d This process used the original master tape cut onto lacquer at half speed, which was then pressed onto Japanese virgin vinyl.\nThe marriage of this direct tape recording and record cutting capability, along with the Japanese vinyl, resulted in a winning combination. Soon thereafter, the Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs record label was born.\nSince 1977, MoFi has been putting out limited runs of these highly sought after hi-fidelity records, which music fans and collectors revere. The company has released more than 400 records to date, including stellar pressings of the Beatles\u2019 \u201cAbbey Road,\u201d \u201cLed Zeppelin II,\u201d the London Philharmonic\u2019s performance of Holst\u2019s \u201cThe Planets\u201d and Weezer\u2019s \u201cPinkerton.\u201d\nPredictably, some of these releases are long out of print and either impossible to find or very expensive. These days it\u2019s tough to find a copy of \u201cAbbey Road\u201d for less than $200 in good condition. If you do, consider yourself lucky, as many collectors consider it the best pressing of this record ever. That\u2019s no small boast: literally hundreds of pressings and remasters of \u201cAbbey Road\u201d are out there.\nMobile Fidelity\u2019s focus has always been on locating and sourcing the original master tapes for the company\u2019s remaster. The remastering process is the art of tapping those\u00a0 original masters to capture the most \u201clife-like\u201d picture of what the artist and producers were trying to attain. While this seems like a given, sourcing said analog masters can be an adventure unto itself for the company. It involves convincing the label and artist to green light the project and then locating the original master tapes.\nBecause a lot of these recordings were made decades ago, this can be an impossible process. Even when they\u2019re found, tapes might be incomplete, oxidized or damaged. If so, the project is scrapped. When masters are deemed worthy, engineers at MFSL work with precision audio pressing equipment so they can get the most from these tapes.\nThe so-called special sauce that makes MoFi records superior is the attention to detail at every turn. The magnetic master tapes are transferred with painstaking precision \u2014 without compression and minimal equalization \u2014 to create as close the exact representation of the music as possible. The vinyl they source, while no longer from Japan, is still 100% virgin and of a much higher density than your average mass market record.\nThis process, of course, is much more expensive, but the results are worth it. The sound floor is consistently quieter and the overall fidelity is virtually unbeatable.\nWith the vinyl market stronger than ever, MFSL continues to expand their catalog with monthly re-issues. The company has even created an ultra premium \u201csuper vinyl\u201d LP line. Called the Ultradisc One-Step Box Sets, these limited edition records are considered to be the highest quality pressing being made today. They are issued in series of 7500 units at a retail cost of $125.00 each \u2014 and sell out almost immediately. In a little more than five years, the after-market for these releases has gone crazy. Santana\u2019s \u201cAbraxas,\u201d if you are lucky enough to find one, will set you back in upwards of $2,000.\nWith the demand and its stellar reputation, the company has expanded operations to include listening accessories and equipment. Three years ago the company built their own factory, \u201cMOFI-Electronics,\u201d and started making their own hi-end audiophile cartridges and turntables. From what we\u2019ve been told, the gear, like the records themselves, are flying off the shelves.\nQuality, it seems, does matter."

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/70s-pioneer-sx-receivers/",
        "content": "Maybe it\u2019s the nostalgia. Perhaps it\u2019s the distinctive stainless steel look, with its warm golden glow emanating from the lights within the interior chassis. For some, it could be the entry level price point that is so alluring about these beautiful sound machines. But for this writer, it\u2019s all of the above, and we haven\u2019t even begun to talk about how these things sound.\nBuilt and engineered like refined tanks in the golden age of stereophonic equipment in the mid 70\u2019s, Pioneer was regarded as the high water mark for both value and high fidelity performance. If Apple designed a stereo receiver, anything from the Pioneer SX Series in the 70\u2019s would be it!\nKnown for their elegance and tactility, the build quality and all materials, internal structure, and wood cabinet are topnotch. The dials and switches are beautifully machined and of an extraordinarily high quality. Not only is this a receiver that makes a statement in your listening room but it\u2019s a machine that you feel like you want to interact with.\nThe minimal design of these complex music conduits make operating the loudness, bass and treble and tone controls a pure pleasure. The smooth resistance of the tuning wheel and volume knob spin so effortlessly and with such a solid feeling, that they add extra authority to the user experience, making you feel as though you are practically engineering the music yourself.\nThe Pioneer industrial designers even compensated for the visual weight of the large tuner control dial by purposely placing the tuner signal and tuning meters off-center. A less thoughtful industrial designer would have placed the meters dead center, eliminating the complexity of the industrial design, but making it less engaging. All of the controls with these vintage Pioneer SX units have that uniquely satisfying firm push button feeling when engaged, and audible \u201cthunk\u201d when activated.\nIn the 70\u2019s advances in electronic componentry, such as the widespread availability and low cost of reliable silicon transistors, made the design and manufacture of receivers feasible and popular. By combining three components, the power amplifier, preamplifier and tuner onto a single chassis, using a single main power supply and only one cabinet, the integrated amplifier was born.\nPioneer was the pinnacle of this Hi-Fi industrial design in the 70\u2019s, but competition was getting fierce. Newcomers like Kenwood, Marantz, Yamaha, and Sansui gave Pioneer quite a run for their money. At one point there were even \u201cPower Wars\u201d to see who could \u201cout power\u201d who in pure wattage. Pioneer that would be the first company to break the 100WPC (watts per channel) barrier with their SX-1010. From here they would make their lauded SX-1250 model that would put out a whopping 160WPC, and then finally in 1979 they would conquer all with The SX-1980, packing in a massive 270WPC.\nThe SX-1250 and SX-1980 models are both incredibly powerful integrated amps that sound clear and detailed, but also have that warmth that vintage fans love. They sound great at all volumes\u00a0and you\u2019ll notice that the sound remains true and transparent throughout. Hook these receivers up to a good pair of large speakers and you can hear the power output in the quality of bass it can put out at high volumes.\nFrom entry level SX-450 thru to the SX-1250, these magnificent sounding stereo units, with all their charm and character, are surprisingly easy to find on the aftermarket. Whether at an online auction such as Ebay, a reputable online marketplace (Audiogone or US-Audiomart) or even at a thrift-shop, these are pretty easy to find in good condition and at a good price.\u00a0 As I write this story, I am listening to a Neil Young record through a Pioneer SX-550 that I recently acquired on eBay, and I can easily say, it was the best $300 I ever spent.\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "title": "In Conversation: A New Era of Audiophile Jazz with Blue Note\u2019s \u2018Tone Poet\u2019 Joe Harley",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/in-conversation-blue-note-joe-harley/",
        "content": "Blue Note\u2019s recent Tone Poet reissue series has stunned fans with picks from their historic catalog, which stretches back to 1939. The magician behind the revival and remastering of these original session tapes is the \u201cTone Poet\u201d himself, Joe Harley. Together he and his team have helped shepherd in a new age of jazz home listening.\nSurprisingly, this is the first \u201chi-fi\u201d project for Blue Note and they make the claim that you\u2019ll never get a better version \u2014 original pressing or otherwise. The aim of the series is to fully honor these sessions of well- and lesser-known artists, including Chick Corea, Hank Mobley and Donald Byrd, and to sonically bring fans into the studio.\nTo the delight of fans, Blue Note has just announced their releases for 2021-2022, the first of which comes out March 12th. It\u2019s from Charles Lloyd, who happens to be who gave Harley his now famous \u201cTone Poet\u201d nickname, and the namesake of the series. The full schedule of releases can be found at the end of this interview.\nWhat was your initial introduction to Blue Note?\nWell, I was a kid in Lincoln, Nebraska, not exactly a hotbed of jazz, but my mother listened to a lot of it at home. I got fascinated, particularly with the drummers, because I was playing drums as a little kid. And when I started to hear people like Philly Joe Jones and Art Blakey, it blew my mind because I didn\u2019t know what they were doing. But I learned. I went to the library and found some old Downbeat magazines and I started to look through them.\nWhen I was about 10, I rode my bicycle down to my local record store and started looking at the jazz section. And to this day, I still don\u2019t know how a store in Lincoln, Nebraska had original Blue Notes. We\u2019re talking 1961, but there they were. I don\u2019t remember the other titles, but they had Sonny Clark\u2019sCool Struttin, and I recognized the name of the drummer because I\u2019d seen his name in Downbeat, Philly Joe Jones. And then to be totally honest the cover was what really drew me in. I was old enough to know that cool was desirable, and so I thought, \u201cAll right, this looks fantastic, plus it\u2019s got those legs on the cover.\u201d And so I took my allowance money and bought the record and raced home on my bicycle; that was my first ever Blue Note record.\nI still remember looking at the logo with it\u2019s blue and white motif.\u00a0 I still remember staring at it thinking how cool it was. Then, when I put the record on, I was hooked. I sat there with my little Ludwig drum set and my headphones trying to play along with Philly Joe Jones. It wasn\u2019t pretty, let me tell you, but the hook was set and I couldn\u2019t get enough after that.\nI really love that story because you talk about the physicality of the record. It's not just a sound but it's the name of the players, it's the feeling of the sleeve; It's a visceral physical experience. I know that was also extremely important to you for the Tone Poet series, how did it fit into this project?\nThat\u2019s a great question. Before we started the programming for Tone Poet, Don Was, President of Blue Note, was very aware of its importance. I had started along with my friend, Ron Ronbock, to re-issue a Blue Note series for the label Music Matters. We did over a hundred titles and we made the decision very early on that we wanted to try to bring whoever bought those records into the event \u2014 give them an idea of what might it have been like to be there. So we did that by breaking the normal mold, which would be to do an exact copy of the original. The originals weren\u2019t gatefolds, by and large, and they didn\u2019t have session photos inside.\nWe knew there were photos by Francis Wolff, who was the other partner in Blue Note along with Alfred Lion. Those two guys founded Blue Note in 1939. Francis was an avid photographer, and lucky for us he took his Nikon camera to almost all the sessions and shot photos. So knowing that we could get a hold of all those photos, we made an arrangement where we could use them in our releases.\nI knew it\u2019d be successful, but did I understand the degree? No. People loved having something where they knew all aspects of the production were done as they should be.\nAnd as far as the presentation, we wanted them to be the best album jacket that could be made and present the music in a way that made it more of an event. The package was nice: the cardboard, the texture, you could feel their old style. They\u2019re called tip-on jackets and it\u2019s the way jackets used to be made. We put session photos on the inside of the gatefold and the specialness of that attention to detail reflected the attention paid to the mastering and all aspects of the production. It was evident from the minute you pick up the record that it was special.\nIt\u2019s incredible that this all happened before the Tone Poet Series. What was that first conversation like with Don Was when he introduced the concept to you?\nWell, Don and I were at EastWest Studios in Hollywood working with Charles Lloyd, a great artist. Don pulled me aside one day and said, \u201cI\u2019d really like to do something like what you and Ron are doing at Music Matters. I\u2019d like you to do it for us. Would you be interested?\u201d And my first thought was they\u2019d never do it because it\u2019s really expensive. You know, the jackets are expensive, the mastering, everything about it is a little more costly and consequently, you have to charge more. So I just figured it\u2019d be very short, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s a great idea, but here\u2019s what you\u2019re looking at,\u201d and that would be the end of it. I explained all that to him and he just got this great big grin and he went, \u201cFantastic.\u201d And so all my defenses were gone and I thought, \u201cWell, if you\u2019re down for that, then I\u2019m down, too.\u201d\nThe way we went, there was some planning and I had to come up with lists of titles. There were some new vendors that Blue Note had to start using and we had to establish those contacts. Anyway, all of that got done, and half a year or so later we were off and running.\nWhat was it like to walk into the Blue Note vaults with all of the master tapes for the first time?\nI get the shivers even thinking about it. You see all the history of jazz sitting there on those shelves. By that time we had done so many Blue Note reissues with Music Matters so I held a lot of those master tapes. But to see them in one spot is just an amazing thing; kind of overwhelming and emotional, in a great way.\nThis was the first HiFi project for Blue Note, so I\u2019m curious, how do you define the term \u201caudiophile\u201d?\nI think one way to look at it is a quest for perfection, which we can never quite attain. What I mean by that is, the word at its best is a desire to bring the studio or live performance into your listening room. In the case of a symphony, AC/DC, or Megadeth or something like that, could you really have that in your living room? Probably not. The authorities would probably show up at some point. But in the case of smaller-scale music like jazz, with the right gear you can come pretty close to recreating the event. Can you ever completely pull off the magic trick? No, and that\u2019s where some of the madness of it comes, because you can get closer and closer, but you never quite achieve a hologram.\nAlthough sonically, if your setup is correct you get what audiophiles referred to as \u201cstage imaging,\u201d If everything is placed properly, you get a complete sort of three-dimensional soundstage. If you listen in the dark or you close your eyes, it\u2019s awfully close and awfully compelling. That might be audiophilia at its best, and that desire at its worst. Sometimes it just becomes hardware worship. And I\u2019ve known audiophiles that have half-a-million dollar setup and 100 records that they play over and over and over again. So then it can become something more akin to listening to the gear rather than listening to the music. So you know there can be good parts to it, and parts that are maybe not quite so healthy, although nobody\u2019s we\u2019re not hurting anybody. There are worse addictions to have.\nWhat is your ideal home listening setup like in regards to gear?\nWell, the speakers I use are Vandersteen Model Sevens, the phono stage and preamp are from Audio Research and the amplifiers are the Ayre Acoustics MX-R power amplifier. The turntables are pretty wild. It\u2019s called the Transcendence and is made by Basis. This stuff is collectively pretty pricey, but the great thing about analog is you can spend a really modest amount of money and hear all the reasons why people get excited by analog.\nThere\u2019s a whole movement, which I know you guys are into, for vintage gear. You can get vintage gear that\u2019s affordable and incredible. You can spend a fortune or you can spend a little, but basically if it\u2019s totally honest and you set it up correctly in your room, I tell people, you can do alot with very little. One sort of handy rule of thumb for speaker setup is to think of it as you\u2019re sitting at the center of an equilateral triangle. You can\u2019t go too far wrong with that.\nMany of those million-dollar systems I wouldn\u2019t give you a nickel for. They can narrow what you want to hear until you can only really play 20 records because the rest of your records sound bad. So you end up not wanting to listen to them. I don\u2019t like gear like that. I want gear that makes me want to hear everything I\u2019ve got.\nI get the distinct impression that In Sheep\u2019s Clothing has a similar sort of view. That it\u2019s really about enjoyment and satisfying the soul and not just worship of gear.\nWas the Tone Poet series meant to be a long-term project? Were you surprised at the success?\nI\u2019ve never really asked Don Was and the others, but I got that impression. When we first started, we were going to try it and see and so initially we agreed to one year.\nAnd I know there were people within the organization that thought, \u201c$35 bucks, who\u2019s going to spend $35 bucks on an album? What, are you guys crazy?\u201d And so initially when we started, the numbers that were ordered from the pressing plant and from the printing company were pretty modest. And I remember when we released the first two records, I got a phone call from Justin Seltzer at Blue Note and he said, \u201cWell, we have a problem.\u201d And I thought, \u201cGosh, you know, first records out, and so I guess this is it. I guess something\u2019s really wrong\u201d. But then he continues with, \u201cYeah, we have a problem. We\u2019ve sold all the records and we haven\u2019t even shipped yet.\u201d\nHistorically though, Blue Note introduced so many things in the history of modern jazz. Like Thelonious Monk, his first records were for Blue Note. Nobody would touch him because he was considered commercially a non-entity\u2026 They knew it was important.\nAnd I thought, \u201cOh, well, that\u2019s a good problem to have. It\u2019s a problem, no doubt about it. It\u2019s better than nobody wants them\u201d. And so for a few release cycles, they kept increasing the numbers ordered and they were never enough. It was like they were kind of dipping their toe in and they kept selling out. It took six or seven months for everyone to kind of understand this is how these things are going to be received. We have an understanding on quantity now, but it\u2019s an ongoing challenge. We\u2019ve got our pressing plant almost maxed out.\nI knew it\u2019d be successful, but did I understand the degree? No. People loved having something where they knew all aspects of the production were done as they should be. In other words, they knew who mastered it, they knew that we were using the original masters and they knew that the presentation, in terms of packaging, was going to be as good as you can get.\nDo you feel like it\u2019s important for listeners to know the history of the original engineer, Rudy van Gelder? His mastering style was so unique.\nYeah,\u00a0I think one of the real important things to know is that in the heyday in the 1950/60s period of Blue Note, Rudy started working with the label, I believe, in 1953. But all throughout until maybe \u201868 or \u201869, Rudy was recording live to two-track. What that means is that you\u2019re mixing on the fly as that session is going down. It\u2019s really hard to do. There\u2019s no punch-in or fix it in the mix later. That\u2019s not possible when it\u2019s live to two tracks. The mix that he\u2019s doing, as the guys are playing is the mix you\u2019re going to get. That\u2019s what you work with.\nSo if Lee Morgan steps up to the microphone and he\u2019s a little close, there might be a little overload and you can hear Rudy diving for the fader to make his adjustment. If you\u2019re after multitrack precision and perfection, you\u2019re not going to get that with Rudy van Gelder recordings. He comes really close though. It\u2019s shocking how good he was, but to me, that\u2019s part of the excitement, too. You can hear him working to get it all in there and contain it.\nAnd there are Art Blakey sessions where Art comes thundering in on drums overloads the mics, and that\u2019s actually kind of exciting too. You hear Rudy trying his best to make his adjustments and it\u2019s all there on the master tape. So yeah, there have been times over the years where customers will say, \u201cOn track two side B, at two minutes and 31 seconds in, I hear what sounds like overload. Why didn\u2019t you guys fix that\u201d? Well, the answer is you can\u2019t. It\u2019s there on the tape. You can\u2019t go back in time and undo it. That\u2019s what\u2019s there. So that\u2019s part of the joy too, you know?\nIt seemed like it wasn't even a question that you would stick to an all-analog chain during the mastering process. Can you speak to that? Was there ever any sort of pull towards digital in any way, or was it a non-negotiable for you?\nYeah, non-negotiable. What\u2019s in the groove is literally the waveform. It\u2019s not ones and zeros it is the actual waveform. And when you hear music or you hear speech, the air gets excited by the event. I\u2019m making the air move a certain way and you can hear it. It\u2019s physical.\nWith the LP playback system, it\u2019s remarkable that it works when you see the complexity in it, but all you\u2019re really doing is you\u2019re amplifying that waveform, whereas, with digital, you are dealing with ones and zeros. And you\u2019re using sophisticated converters that are trying to operate quickly so that the ear can be fooled into hearing a replication of the analog waveform and they\u2019ve gotten really good.\nDigital edits can be great, but when there\u2019s an analog master available, we always use it 100% of the time. We have done some releases \u2014 a couple of Joe Henderson records, some of the more modern stuff that were all recorded in the digital era \u2014 so there is no analog master. And those have come out in the Tone Poet series, but we make it clear that those are the sources we used. We use amazing converters, and we get great results. But if there\u2019s an analog master that\u2019s what we use, 100%. If they can\u2019t find it or it doesn\u2019t exist then I don\u2019t put it out.\nSome hardcore fans are a bit critical that the series is putting out stereo records instead of mono, like the originals. How did you decide to go with stereo?\nIn the realm of Blue Note collectors of original releases, I am one of them.\u00a0 I have tons and tons of original Blue Notes and a lot of people got into collecting the monos, which is great. There\u2019s no right or wrong about it. To me, when we first started doing this back in 2007 at Music Matters we started to hear for the first time the actual master tapes. The goal changed from what we thought when we started: We thought we should try to make them as much like the original record as possible. When we heard the masters, it was shocking how incredible those things were. I thought I knew a record that I\u2019ve heard my whole life, and then I heard \u201cCool Struttin\u2019\u201d put up the master tape. Our goal changed right then. We wanted to bring people back to what happened that day in the studio. Let\u2019s try to bring them right to the event.\nAnd if you think about when you go to a jazz club, let\u2019s say, and you\u2019re sitting there in the front row, you\u2019re not going to hear the horn players, the bass player, the piano player, the drummer all lined up in the center. They would never do that. They\u2019re spread out on a stage. In the era when Blue Note just started, they didn\u2019t have stereo, so everything Rudy recorded from 1953 up to the beginnings of 1957 was all mono to begin with. When we release those, which we have and will continue to do so, they\u2019re mono because that\u2019s all there is.\nLater, Rudy starts recording in stereo and an interesting thing happens that I was unaware of until we started looking at the master tapes. Those master tapes, all say something on the bottom. Each one says, \u201cMo master\u201d; mo meaning monaural master. \u201cMo master made 5050 from stereo.\u201d What Rudy did was, the recordings were all in stereo \u2014 to get mono. This is a little bit of an overstatement, but if you have a mono button on your preamp, you could do the same thing. There\u2019s a little bit more to it than that, but there was only one master and that master was stereo. He summed the channels to get mono so that he didn\u2019t have to have two machines going at the same time.\nYou get to the modern era and it really hasn\u2019t changed, you know? It keeps growing and morphing. Blue Note has always been about keeping ears to the ground and presenting, as they say in the logo, \u201cThe finest in jazz\u201d.\nHow does Blue Note fit into the history of jazz? What's Blue Notes\u2019 place in it all?\nWell, they started in 1939, and the initial releases were by these Boogie Woogie piano players, Midlux Lux Lewis and Albert Ammons, and some others. The two guys who started the label were both Jewish German immigrants. In fact, they got out of Germany right before the war. They ended up in New York and they had seen some concerts in Berlin as they were growing up and knew they loved the Black American music that they\u2019d seen.\nThey didn\u2019t have much money, found these boogie woogie players and arranged for a recording session. They recorded these guys, pressed up some records, sold them at a few record shops as best they could and that\u2019s how\u00a0Blue Note started.\nHistorically though, Blue Note introduced so many things in the history of modern jazz. Like Thelonious Monk, his first records were for Blue Note. Nobody would touch him because he was considered commercially a non-entity, I mean, musicians loved him and Francis and Alfred liked what they heard. They knew it was important. And even though the records weren\u2019t selling, they kept making records with Thelonious Monk. We\u2019re talking about the late \u201840s at this point. Then the music began to morph. You had bebop like Charlie Parker and all that.\nBlue Note was really key to documenting all of that. That\u2019s where that really came from, and then you go all through the \u201850s and \u201860s, and you\u2019ve got Blue Note continuing its hard bop roots, but morphing into the avant garde, and then in the 70s funk starts to be an element in jazz.\nIt goes to the whole point that jazz isn\u2019t static music. It\u2019s ever-changing,\u00a0 and Blue Note was too. Those two guys had their ears to the ground and knew all the musicians.\nYou get to the modern era and it really hasn\u2019t changed, you know? It keeps growing and morphing. Blue Note has always been about keeping ears to the ground and presenting, as they say in the logo, \u201cThe finest in jazz\u201d.\nI think it's really important to underscore the idea of documentation. I feel like that gets lost when people think about vinyl or just recordings in general that it is a documentation of a moment, which is very special. Was that a concept that was thought about when Blue Note started?\nWithout a doubt. For both Alfred Lion and Francis Wolfe, documenting the music was paramount to them and remains to be incredibly important with the current label.\nWe\u2019re not dealing in an area where we\u2019re talking about millions and millions of records being sold. This is not the top 10 or anything, so there\u2019s an element of art that\u2019s really important and Blue Note has really always stood for that. We want to sell records and keep going, so there\u2019s an element of \u2018Gotta stay in business,\u2019 but the artistic element is really the primary goal.\nI read that Charles Lloyd and the Marvels are kicking off this next series starting in March with a brand new record. Can you tell us a bit about that? I\u2019m sure that\u2019s special to you since he gave you the \u201cTone Poet\u201d nickname.\nCharles and I have known each other for many years and we\u2019ve always been working together.\u00a0I think we started working together in the early \u201890s. He was on ECM at that time and we began to do sessions together. And I noticed my credit on those records would be \u201cJoe Harley, Tone Poet,\u201d and I was doing what normally would be considered production work. I\u2019d be in the studio to help run the sessions and that sort of thing. I still get emails from him almost everyday and they always say something like, \u201cMy dear TP.\u201d\nAnd I mean, I\u2019ve never tried to say, \u201cCharles, what do you mean by that,\u201d because we don\u2019t really talk in that way, but I think he knows someone\u2019s really caring about the presentation of sound that is honoring the music. I believe that\u2019s what he means. And Don Was would hear Charles call me that all the time. Don actually suggested using it as the name of the series, and I was okay with it.\nI also love that tone has the other meaning of when you're creating an atmosphere or mood as well. At least from my perspective, you do create a very special mood with your work and especially with this series..\nThank you, that\u2019s great to hear. When trying to come up with what to release, I get asked a lot, \u201cWell, how do you pick the titles?\u201d I listen to music all the time and with Blue Note plus its subsidiaries, it\u2019s endless. You keep thinking it\u2019s finite and you\u2019ll get to the bottom or the end but you never do. And I sequence the release in a way that I hope is interesting to people. Is there a formula? Nope. It\u2019s just totally by feel.\nIt\u2019s unbelievable how much they recorded, and they recorded so much that they lost the tracks of what they had, so things didn\u2019t come out.\u00a0There were occasions, although not as many as you might think, where a record didn\u2019t come out because the session was substandard in some way. But by and large, it was the case that many artists would ask \u201cWell, why didn\u2019t you put this out?\u201d and the label would say, \u201cWe were so busy.\u201d Frequently the artist would respond saying, \u201cOh, I got something much better now. Check out my new music.\u201d They might have been getting ready to pick up the old one, but they would go along with it so that session would get shelved and lost in the shuffle \u2014 essentially forgotten.\nIt\u2019s really nice to be able to take the time and go through everything.\u00a0 When you listen to them fresh, you find so much stuff that is absolutely as worthy as anything that came out. It just didn\u2019t see the light of day.\nAre there some especially notable upcoming releases that you want to kind of talk a little bit more about?\nAndrew Hill\u2019s 1969 albumPassing Ships. Andrew Hill is another one of these singular artists that you know his music the minute you hear it, in the same way when you hear Monk, you just know. You can listen for five seconds to go, \u201cOkay, that\u2019s Monk.\u201d Andrew Hill\u2019s the same way. He has such a stylistically singular way of dealing with harmony and harmonic structure.\u00a0The record is made with a larger band that has been a favorite forever, but it was only released originally on CD. This release will be the first time this has ever been on vinyl, so that\u2019s highly exciting to me. It\u2019s all been mixed to analog so it\u2019s analog all the way. That\u2019s coming out very shortly, and that one\u2019s important to me.\nThere\u2019s a record by two artists that most people will go, \u201cI have no idea who these people are,\u201d but the musicians are Curtis Amy and Dupree Bolton. It\u2019s calledKatanga!and I can\u2019t wait for it to come out because I think people are going to be just shocked. I have test pressings and when I play it for people, it\u2019s always the same. They always say, \u201cWow, who are these guys?!\u201d.\nIn Dupre Bolton\u2019s case, it\u2019s a sad story. He\u2019s a brilliant trumpet player right there with Lee Morgan or anyone you want to mention. He had his own voice but he spent a lot of time in prison. And so only was afforded a few opportunities to record. This is one of them, and it\u2019s a record that sort of transcends the great musicianship. The tunes are amazing. It\u2019s soulful. I was playing it the other night and thinking that this is one of those perfect records. It puts you in a place that is so deep, and so I\u2019m excited about that.\nIt\u2019s hard to pick. It\u2019s like you have 100 children, let\u2019s say, which one is your favorite child? We did one the other day and it was important to me. It\u2019s a record from Gerald Wilson, who was LA based and he was a big band arranger composer. So many great players came through his band, and his son is Anthony Wilson. We were mastering a record calledMoment of Truth, which is one of Gerald\u2019s greatest records. And even in the era of COVID, we\u2019re all masked up when we\u2019re mastering and I asked Anthony if he wanted to come by because we were doing his dad\u2019s record. He came over and as soon as he came in, the tapes went up and sounded ridiculously amazing. It ended up being very emotional. When you\u2019re hearing those masters on a great set-up like at our mastering studio, it\u2019s like his dad\u2019s alive and you\u2019re hearing it like they\u2019re there.\nThere\u2019s also a Grant Green record that\u2019s calledFeelin\u2019 The Spirit, which is a record that a lot of people think may be one of the greatest things he\u2019s ever done. It\u2019s all gospel music and it\u2019s just amazing. Herbie Hancock\u2019s on that record and he just \u2014 it\u2019s some of the best supporting work I\u2019ve ever heard, just amazing.\nYou can follow Harley on Instagram at@jazzsarawatifor all of the behind the scenes footage of his work.\nBlue Note has announced the entire 2021-22 schedule for the Tone Poet Series, and will start with Charles Harley\u2019s new record \u201cTone Poem\u201d, on March 12th.\nBlue Note\u2019s 2021-2022 Schedule:http://www.bluenote.com/2021-2022-tone-poet-vinyl-series-line-up/"

        "content": "First introduced by the Klipsch speaker company as the center channel for the Klipschorn in 1957, the Heresy has for decades garnered a storied reputation among high-end audio enthusiasts. Made by hand in the US, this is a true high fidelity loudspeaker system.\nAt only 25 inches tall and weighing 25 pounds each, you can be easily fooled by their \u201ccompact\u201d size. It would be a mistake, however, to underestimate the power that resides within; they pack in a full 12-inch fiber composite woofer, a one-inch compression tweeter and a two-inch, mid-range compression driver.\nThey deliver ample power thanks to the company\u2019s signature horn-loaded construction, which is known for its dynamic range. They do what you want them to do without hesitation.\nWith the solid wood cabinet construction serving as a perfect amplification conduit, the Heresey looks beautiful. And with four wooden finishes (walnut, cherry, distressed oak or black), these units are sure to complement and blend in seamlessly with your listening surroundings.\nHeresy speakers are super balanced with a mid-range so spectacular that the three-dimensional, hefty presence feels larger than life. They sound sweet at any volume. When played low, you can feel the delicacy and intimacy \u2014 that sense of being in the room with the instruments themselves. The music comes to life with clarity; it has an oomph that can make you feel like you\u2019re actually within the music, even at quieter volumes.\nThe model also has a spectacular efficiency level of 99db sensitivity into 9ohms, resulting in a build that can be comfortably driven with amplification as low as five watts per channel. But up the volume and they can provide the wallop of a finely tuned muscle car and reach concert-level decibels.\nThe latest 4th generation Heresy IVs are spectacular for the price \u2014 at $3,000 a pair. They\u2019ve recently been given a new and improved overhaul, bringing even more energy, lushness and presence than\u00a0 previous models. For those on a budget, we highly recommend tracking down a used Heresy I or II from the 70\u2019s or 80\u2019s, which you can typically find on eBay or craigslist for about $750 with a bit of patience. A few members of the ISC staff actually have these as the main speakers in their home listening setups.\nNote: If you opt for a brand new pair, just remember that these speakers need to be broken in. High performance speakers require listening time for them to come into their own (kind of like a baseball glove). You\u2019ll need at least 500 hours of listening in order to bring life to the bass driver and for the tweeter to soften up a little, as it will be tight and bright to start. Obviously, if you\u2019re buying used this most likely won\u2019t be an issue. Regardless, you\u2019re in for a treat.\nVisit Klipsch for more information:https://www.klipsch.com/products/heresy-iv-floorstanding-speaker\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "title": "Intro to Hi-fi Audio: Vintage Edition",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/intro-to-hi-fi-audio-vintage-edition/",
        "content": "It\u2019s a hotly debated topic when upgrading or investing in hi-fi gear: Do you buy vintage or go new? New components offer superior technology, argue  some. The classic stuff exudes a warmth lacking in new models, offer others. Each argument has validity. What you buy depends on what you need, and the better informed you are the easier it\u2019ll be to draw your own conclusions.\nPart oneof our intro to hi-fi audio series took you through the basics of setting up a home audio system. The following primer will dive into the basics of vintage gear, things to consider before purchasing and a few brands and models that we recommend.\nAmong the biggest selling points of going vintage is cost. It will be way cheaper going used when assembling your dream set-up, and you can find surprising deals if you know how to look. Whether via an online auction site such as Ebay, a reputable online marketplace likewww.audiogon.com,reverb.comorwww.usaudiomart.com, or even a lucky thrift store or Craigslist find, these units can be pretty easy to procure at a good price.\nIt will take more effort, though, and buying used stuff is a riskier proposition. In more cases than not, a component won\u2019t come with more than a handshake agreement, and repairs to might run a few hundred dollars. But because your initial investment will be lower than a newer alternative, this risk is somewhat minimized. Still, with online auctions, secondary market marketplaces, thrift shops, buyer beware. If you\u2019re not careful you could wind up with a piece that shorts out after a few months or needs a total refurbishment.\nDon\u2019t let this discourage you. Online audiophiles on forums such asAudioholics,AVS Forum, orAudiogonhave opinions on virtually any brand or model of note, and many love sharing information.\nMany reputable \u2018after market\u2019 dealers do stand behind their products and guarantee them with a limited warranty. Expect some general wear and tear, but usually a quick cleaning, tune up or \u2018recap\u2018 can get this gear up to speed.\nThe 1970\u2019s saw peak demand for stereo equipment, and a range of mass-market receivers built in this era are highly coveted. Because most everyone had a stereo in those days, there are a lot of models out there and  companies including Pioneer, Marantz, Harman Kardon, Sony and Kenwood heavily invested in making stuff sound good.\nStereo receivers had an outstanding build quality, and remain as solid state as they come. Vintage Pioneer, Harman Kardon and Marantz units have a deep sound: smooth, balanced, incredibly clear and pleasing to the ear. While the midrange frequency curve is not as precise compared with some newer amplifiers, what they lack in precision and finesse they make up for in bass depth, rolled-off sound and value. Throw in the streamlined, classic \u201870s aesthetic \u2014 the sublime orange, blue or green glow of the meters, the tactile feel of the knobs, the resistance in both the tone controls and balance, the giant flywheel tuning knob \u2014 and these machines are pure art. For what they are and what they currently cost, the ability to develop a relationship and live with these audio machines can bring endless listening pleasure.\nA few other incentives to going used: many vintage units were built with moving magnet phono pre-amps that are on par with, if not better than,  many stand-alone phono pre amps being sold today. As well, most vintage receivers come with built in AM/FM tuners, a big selling point back in the day that\u2019s more bonus these days. Not only is it fun to wheel through the radio dial again on these rigs, but more important, it\u2019s a good idea to have a working radio signal in the house just in case the internet goes down. Most people don\u2019t even realize that they don\u2019t have a radio receiver in the house, and in emergencies they are essential.\nDon\u2019t forget, though: vintage amps don\u2019t have remote control, have limited auxiliary inputs and no digital capacity to speak of. That said, such issues can be easily resolved by adding a relatively inexpensive DAC streaming device.\nA quick diversion: In the 80\u2019s, the audio business shifted with consolidation and manufacturing shortcuts; the sector became as much about advertising, looks and wattage stats as quality sound. Cheaper materials were employed and solid state transistors were abandoned for microchips. With these shifts, much of the sound vibrancy, explosiveness and depth was lost. In essence, life went out of amplifiers in the 80\u2019 and 90\u2019s. This is why, if you\u2019re thinking of going vintage, it\u2019s best to stick to something from the 1970\u2019s heyday.\nThe major evolution across the past 50 years has been in the resolution and imaging of today\u2019s components. Whereas old-school vintage equipment seems to produce a more intimate, subtle sound, new amplifiers from companies such as NAD and Cambridge Audio are more aesthetically minimalist and often lack the warm glow and the smoothness of vintage. They compensate for this in precision, particularly the overall spatial separation and soundstage. New-build high end amplification gear tends to have much more wattage to drive any set of speakers. They have built-in modern adaptability features \u2014 such as a plethora of inputs, digital capability, Bluetooth and remote control.\nAdditional Recommendations:\nThe major selling point for vintage speakers are the cabinets, usually made of solid wood for a wonderfully dynamic, room-consuming sound. The best are beautifully crafted and, in some cases, can be as big as pieces of furniture (See:Klipschorn corner speaker).\nMost vintage speakers have a paper-cone woofer with dome metal tweeters. This construction creates an airy resonance that results in a live-sounding acoustic warmth. Their wide-ranging frequency response remains up to today\u2019s standards and they can be driven with pretty much any amplifier. This is one reason why speaker companies like Klipsch still use many of the same materials as a half-century ago \u2014 for that\u00a0spacial feeling that\u2019s both balanced and responsive. But know that you\u2019ll need some space in your listening room for the most massive of them.\nAlso know that buying vintage speakers more than 20-years-old will often require replacing the foam around woofers. The process can be complicated and expensive, so before buying\u00a0always ask when they were last refoamed.\nNewer speaker models are generally, but of course not always, smaller \u2014 see bookshelf speakers \u2014 and come in a variety of finishes. Some are built from solid compost materials\u00a0\u2014 high density plastics and lacquer consistent with a tighter, more precise sound path and better sound separation. But these modern beauties, in spite of their technical merits, can sometimes sound a little sterile and synthetic when compared with their wooden-cabinet counterparts.\nWhile some of the newer speakers (Martin Logan, Paradigm) blow the frequency response of older speakers out of the water, they often require a lot of power and can only perform with mega-wattage modern amps. Which is to say, be careful with your pairing.\nAdditional Recommendations:\nTurntables are the exception here. Things have changed in favor of more modern players. Because turntables have more moving parts, acquiring fully intact used turntable requires hunting; chances are you\u2019ll have to replace something \u2014 the tone arm lever, belts, the footers to level properly or a cracked dust cover. Given the scarcity of some parts, replacing broken systems can be tough.\nIf you\u2019re hellbent on classic \u201870s design to round out the look of your system, though, when shopping for old turntables make sure you look for one with an adjustable tone arm that fits standard cartridges. Ninety-percent of a turntable\u2019s sound quality comes from the cartridge (the other 10% stems from a turntable\u2019s quietness), so if the sound coming from your turntable isn\u2019t working for you, upgrading the cartridge will more likely solve the problem.\nWhich is to say, spend less on the turntable and more on the cartridge.\nAdditional Recommendations:\nWith audio gear, most of time the main factor in getting quality sound is the combination of equipment you team together. If you put the wrong vintage amp with the wrong modern speakers, you could be disappointed. The trial-and-error process of matching audio gear will really affect the sound of your system. If in doubt, find someone who knows what they\u2019re doing. Audiophiles are an opinionated lot.\nAlso know that there\u2019s nothing wrong with mixing and matching pieces from different eras to find the optimal sound. Just don\u2019t be sucked in by the bells and whistles of newer gear \u2014 and pay less attention to wattage and sampling bit rates, two metrics that can be very misleading.\nMore important is the emotional pull and connection you get when you\u2019re intensely listening to music. If your system\u2019s sound relaxes you and delivers contentment and a smile, then you\u2019ve reached the summit of hi-fi listening.\nIn the following weeks, we\u2019ll be diving into specific gear mentioned in this piece with detailed information on suggested price, sound, pairings, and more.

        "content": "The room recordings on the ISC website are meant to start a conversation. A discussion about sound, ceremony and industry. They\u2019re also an argument in favor of a specific kind of experience in active listening: We are selecting pressings of albums from our collection,\u00a0 spinning them on a specific sound system in a well-designed environment and capturing those playbacks with specific mic set-ups.\nDo these room recordings sound different than what\u2019s heard on streaming platforms? Absolutely. Do they sound better? That\u2019s your call.\nThe latest room recordings were done in our new listening space at the ISC HiFi office. You might notice a different sound from the first ones. The following gear was used for these sessions:\nKlipsch Cornwall Speakers\nEico HF-81 Amplifier\nGarrard 301 Turntable\nThomas Schick Tonearms, Headshells & Cartridges\n2 x Blue Dragonfly Microphones\nJust as appreciating music is a subjective experience, our mind and body feel sonic vibrations based on how we listen. \u201cHigh-fidelity\u201d can be defined along a broad spectrum, but it boils down to excellent sound reproduction. The optimal hi-fi equipment contains no audible noise or distortion; and an untinted, neutral frequency response that resides in the sweet spot of the human hearing range.\nSome audiophiles argue that compact discs sound better than vinyl, and have differing\u00a0 perspectives on sound quality among streaming platforms. Thankfully, there are more options than ever when it comes to high-definition streaming platforms, Tidal HiFi, Amazon HD, Qobuz and Apple among them. Do the distinctions matter to more than a small subset of consumers? Probably not. Should they matter more? I believe so.\nThe goal of our in-room re-recordings of albums on the ISC site isn\u2019t to suggest an \u201coptimal\u201d way to consume this music digitally. In fact, from a fidelity perspective, the streaming service links and embeds we use are of higher quality. Some of these recordings might even be a bit noisy.\u00a0We just wanted to experiment.\nIt\u2019s true: We don\u2019t have licenses in place for the room recordings. It\u2019s also true that we\u2019re not collecting any streaming revenue, which is likely why no one has issued a take-down notice. Inevitably, that will happen, and when it does we want to make it easy for rights holders by\u00a0 licensing a passthrough approval. That will allow us to continue this experiment and argument while promoting albums in our collection. Hopefully, it will help propel the conversation regarding recorded audio and the various modes of playback.\nThe business side of streaming is a lot muddier then it should be. You\u2019d think that as accounting becomes automated, the ability to monetize streaming royalties would be more streamlined. I have found this to not be the case. The ways in which streaming money eventually trickles down to creators also seems antiquated. In Sheep\u2019s Clothing isn\u2019t aiming to make money on room recordings that we feature on our site. We consider ourselves to be a discovery platform that curates albums. Eventually, our plan is to release our own exclusive pressings on the platform in collaboration with some of our favorite labels, distributors and \u2014 of course \u2014 the creators themselves.\nOur argument is pretty basic: It\u2019s important to listen to music. It\u2019s important to listen to entire sides of albums, and commit to focusing on whole works. That\u2019s definitely true of the room recordings we feature on this platform. The records are brilliant from start to finish, and to truly understand the artists\u2019 intent you need to go deep into both sides.\nIf you are a rights holder of any music we showcase on the site and have questions, please\u00a0 reach out to us directly at[email\u00a0protected].\nThank you again for listening."

The film follows discoveries and advances in sound technology from Edison\u2019s phonograph all the way to surround sound and provides perspective on how sound designers in film and music influenced and inspired each other.\nFor instance, as George Martin introduced stereo phasing in Beatles records, the architect of modern sound design Walter Murch introduced stereo to the silver screen. Murch not only found inspiration inRevolverbut cites New York minimalist John Cage as a major influence on his approach to soundtracking as well as musique concr\u00e8te pioneers Pierre Henry and Pierre Schaffer. Another section shows how Tomita\u2019s quadraphonic albumThe Planetsinspired Francis Ford Coppola to build the first multi-speaker theater system.\nAll in all, the documentary is a beautiful contemplation on sound and fidelity.

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/in-conversation-kamran-v-quark/",
        "content": "Kamran V builds bridges between technology and artistry. He\u2019s a producer, sound artist, designer, and engineer who has been working with spatial sound since the early 2000\u2019s. His work with Moogfest, Interscope and SONOS Studio has led to projects with artists as diverse as Beck, Nine Inch Nails and Suzanne Cianni. In 2018, his label CyKiK released Cianni\u2019sLIVE Quadraphonic,the first quadraphonic vinyl release in more than 30 years.\nLast year, through the support of the National Endowment of the Arts, Kamran collaborated with non-profit radio stationdublabto develop theQuadraphonic Universally Accessible Resource Kit (QUARK), a free software plugin that allows music makers and listeners to easily create and distribute quadraphonic spatial sound.\nThe next phase of the effort continues with a project launching called Make Music in Space (MMS). MMS is a national call for submissions to develop immersive quadraphonic work utilizing QUARK. The first call for submissions opens today with the creative prompt \u201cBreathing Space.\u201d The review panel includesSuzanne Ciani,Laura Escud\u00e9,Laraaji,Craig Leon, andTimeboy.\nFind more information about QUARK and Make Music in Space here:https://quark.cykik.com/\nWe spoke to Kamran about his history with spatial sound and why he believes the quadraphonic format can be a bridge to the future.\nHow did you first get into quadraphonic sound?\nWhen I was a kid, you\u2019d have your A&B speakers on your receiver, and I remember borrowing my brother\u2019s or my parents\u2019 speakers to have 2 speakers on each channel. Later on, I got a boombox and would route that to the other channels to create a pseudo-surround experience. It wasn\u2019t really any sort of real surround sound, but these early experiments allowed me to perceive sound in a new way and get my brain exploring the possibilities.\nMy first proper surround experience was through my neighbor Ron Smith who had a real surround sound receiver, playing a scene from his Top Gun VHS. Then being from Oklahoma, I heard the Flaming Lips doing the experiments leading toZaireeka. It blew my mind.\nYears later, I was able to produce some surround sound records while working at Interscope and started to research quadraphonic releases of the 1970s. Before then, I\u2019d always known that quad records and eight tracks existed but never really tangibly thought of it. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what many people think of quad today; some old format from the 1970s.\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t until I was producing Moogfest that I got deep into true quadraphonic sound. Inspired by Suzanne Cianni\u2019s sudden return to the quad-native buchla synth after 40 years away, I really dove in head first. We already had artists challenging themselves with 3-5 hour \u201cdurational performances\u201d at Moogfest and then decided to take it one step further, making them quadraphonic. It was really fun.\nFor those that aren\u2019t familiar, can you give a basic background on quadraphonic sound?\nThere are two concepts to consider when thinking about quad. First, there\u2019s the idea of sending audio to four discreet speakers. This has been around for a long time and the Buchla 200 synth that Suzanne is known for using pioneered this concept in performance in the \u201860s.\nThen there\u2019s the method of how to get more than two channels of audio on two channel formats like vinyl and radio\u2026 In the late 60s the ideas around this came about and several companies got into this part, the most widely used method was a way to use audio phasing to fold two channels into four channels then using a magic box to unfold the two channels back to four.\nWhen you see records that say that they\u2019re in quad, many of which were usually the QS or SQ formats. It was kind of a VHS vs Beta kind of situation. QS was the better performing Japanese format and SQ was the American one with more releases. Same story\u2026 in the end, everyone failed until Dolby applied all of this stuff to film. This is how my neighbor Ron Smith was able to get surround sound out of his Top Gun VHS tape.\nHow difficult was it to set up those quadraphonic performances back then at Moogfest?\nDoing quadraphonic now versus doing it in the 1960\u2019s is drastically different. Probably the biggest difference is that now we have these vector based computer panners where in the past you had to mechanically pan things or use voltage controls, which is what Suzanne does with her Buchla 227 module in her Buchla 200 synth.\nThe Buchla 227 is a quadraphonic module invented by Don Buchla that allows you to route audio signals based on voltage. It was just very difficult to do quadraphonic in the past. Today, now that we have these programs, it\u2019s much easier. Most of the audio interfaces have four outputs or more, you just have to know how to route it. It\u2019s just a matter of getting your brain wired to it.\nDuring my time doing Moogfest, I had this epiphany while on a trip to Athens, Georgia. I was traveling with a friend who I was working with at Moogfest and one of his close friends had just passed. We did an installation of Suzanne\u2019s work in a massive field. I had a really crazy, emotional experience listening to the sounds while watching my friend mourn, and all of a sudden something Suzanne told me clicked. She said \u201cQuad is musical.\u201d All of that inspiration showed me the way forward and how this old format could build a bridge to the future.\nTell us about the new Quadraphonic Universally Accessible Resource Kit (QUARK) that you\u2019ve developed in collaboration with dublab.\nQUARKis a free software plugin which encodes and decodes Quadraphonic spatial sound in real time, allowing anyone to easily distribute Quadraphonic music through all existing media including vinyl, radio, streaming video such as YouTube and music services such as iTunes and Spotify. The thesis of it is to create opportunities for music makers in all kinds of paths in spatial sound like VR, for instance.\nWe\u2019re getting closer and closer to this virtual world. As these worlds are being made, there\u2019s more and more interest or demand for creating a similar vibe in those spaces that we had in real life. Spatial music is one of those components. If people are making music today and want to have opportunities now and into the future, if they just start making their music with quad as their master, then it opens up a lot of possibilities for VR, Dolby Atmos, etc. and all they\u2019re doing is using QUARK to make their music fit current distribution channels while preparing their music for future opportunities.\nThe musicality of it is that it\u2019s more accessible, that\u2019s what clicked in my mind working with Suzanne. It\u2019s more natural to think in this way.\nDoing spatial music seems so complicated and unattainable. It\u2019s like I want to make my song and I want to put it out so people can hear it easily on Spotify, for instance. I also want to do spatial music but I don\u2019t want to have to do a whole other mix of my song for that. The QUARK plugin allows you to start your creative process in quadraphonic space with the benefit of these amazing vector based panners allowing you to potentially render your music to as many channels as you want. Hypothetically, all of these phantom centers in your quad studio could be real speakers in Atmos, if you want. QUARK makes it easy for you as a creative person to commit to making spatial music from the start of the process, and do it in the simplest way possible; with four speakers.\nYou\u2019ve said in previous interviews that the quadraphonic format lends itself much better to music making. Why is that?\nTo me, it\u2019s the simplification. It\u2019s easier to translate your emotion into four channels than six channels (5.1). As a listener, it\u2019s also less intimidating. The musicality of it is that it\u2019s more accessible, that\u2019s what clicked in my mind working with Suzanne. It\u2019s more natural to think in this way.\nWhen I was working at Interscope, I made a few records in 5.1 surround sound with Beck and Nine Inch Nails. It was so much work and also just so difficult for people to think in surround sound. I realized the second you remove the center speaker and the sub as something to think about, it just opens your mind. You can think of four speakers better than you can think of 5.1. It\u2019s just a weird psychological twist.\nThe technology for quadraphonic has been around since the 60\u2019s but sometimes, like in this case, it takes looking back to be able to look forward. Sometimes, we forget to look back at these things. I think on an emotional or even cultural standpoint, this is where quadraphonic seems to resonate, it just feels more natural.\nYou released Suzanne Cianni's amazing LIVE Quadraphonic album a few years ago. Any other upcoming projects/releases you\u2019d like to share?\nI\u2019m working on a quadraphonic record with Patrick Gleeson. It\u2019s a jazz record but it\u2019s far out! He really did a lot of the hard work inspiring people through his albums with Herbie Hancock. He\u2019s been in the middle of a lot of pivotal things. I don\u2019t why, but I\u2019m working with a lot of legendary musical veterans like Suzanne, Gleeson, and Morton Subotnick. It\u2019s shocking how on-it they are with the technology. All of them are just going for it. I hope I\u2019m that with it as I get older.\nI have another project coming out with Bedrock.LA and dublab calleddecades (in space)that\u2019s all quadraphonic. It\u2019s ten songs by twenty artists, because it was Bedrock\u2019s 10th anniversary and dublab\u2019s 20th. Emily from Warpaint and Suzanne Cianni did one. Laura Escud\u00e9 and Sudan Archives did one. Laraaji and Beatie Wolfe\u2026 It\u2019s all completely original compositions. Part of the idea was challenging these artists and giving them license to go outside of their usual realm. It may be the first compilation album of music made specifically for quadraphonic listening.\nLastly, what are a few albums you wish were available in quadraphonic?\nI\u2019ve actually talked with some labels about releasing old stuff in quadraphonic. Personally, I\u2019d love to do Beastie Boys\u2019The In Sound from Way Out!, Beck\u2019sMidnight Vultures, Public Enemy\u2019sFear of a Black Planet, or anything Prince\u2026 It starts to be really fun to rediscover music in that way. You see that already with the way they\u2019ve remixed old catalogs from Elton John, Bowie, etc. It\u2019s happening, but very specifically. It\u2019s all very sales oriented and expensive, but this plugin will hopefully make things less expensive and accessible to more artists."

        "content": "It would behoove every listener-collector\u00a0 \u2014 vinyl freaks and Hi-Fi heads included \u2014 to consider subscribing to a streaming service, politics be damned. Yes, royalty payments to your favorite musicians are paltry at best, insulting at worst. But artists make zero dollars from Discogs sales; however rare, once a record gets on the secondary market the profit stream is dead for everyone except the seller.\nBut this isn\u2019t an op-ed in favor of the streaming model, which seems fundamentally broken, at best. Rather, we\u2019re looking to bridge the seeming divide between vinyl-only enthusiasts and the format-neutral collectors who use streaming services as one tool in the endless quest to feed the musical beast.\nWhich is to say, if you\u2019re going to stream, the experience may as well sound as close to incredible as possible.\nAt the end of 2020, we highlighted the French-born high-definition streaming serviceQobuz, which launched in the U.S. two years ago. To start 2021, we\u2019re focusing on Amazon Music HD, which the mega-retailer launched last year as an add-on to its Amazon Music streaming service.\nWho: Amazon Music HD\nWhat: The high-definition tier of the mega-retailer\u2019s Amazon Music service, Amazon Music HD offers CD-quality streams for 70 million songs. As well, the platform has an ever-expanding bunch of albums given the \u201cUltra HD\u201d treatment \u2014 5 millions songs. Though light on editorial, the service taps into the company\u2019s database to offer a bounty of playlists.\nPrice: $12.99/month for Amazon Prime members and $14.99 for non-Prime customers.\nSales pitch, per Amazon Music HD: \u201cAmazon Music HD offers lossless audio in two quality ranges: HD and Ultra HD. HD tracks are 16-bit audio, with a minimum sample rate of 44.1 kHz (16/44.1 is also referred to as CD-quality) and an average bitrate of 850 kbps. Ultra HD tracks have a bit depth of 24 bits, with sample rates ranging from 44.1 kHz up to 192 kHz and an average bitrate of 3730 kbps.\n\u201cIn comparison, most standard streaming services currently offer Standard Definition (SD) with a bitrate up to 320 kbps. These audio files use lossy compression, where details of the original audio are removed in order to reduce the file size. By contrast, Amazon Music HD preserves the original recording information to deliver the highest quality sound available, more than 2x the bitrate in HD and more than 10x the bitrate at the highest Ultra HD bitrate.\u201d\nView from the inside: \u201cAmazon Music HD is really meant to provide that premium-listening, lossless sound experience to as wide an audience as possible,\u201d says Amazon Music\u2019s Stephen Brower, who handles artist relations. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I think is super exciting for music streaming in general because there\u2019s always been this trade-off of quality and convenience. And I think at a high level, what we\u2019re hoping to sort of accomplish is eliminating that trade-off and providing quality sound and convenience at the highest level available.\u201d\nCatalog:As expected, the company has tons of offerings in HD, but what\u2019s more stunning are the Ultra HD recordings, which provide so much wildly remarkable depth and clarity that at times it\u2019s hard to imagine any file sounding better. Listen to Prince\u2019s \u201cSign o\u2019 the Times\u201d or Janet Jackson\u2019s \u201cControl\u201d in Ultra HD and be transformed.\nTry Amazon Music HD for free for 30 days:https://www.amazon.com/music/unlimited/hd"

        "content": "It\u2019s no secret that In Sheep\u2019s Clothing focuses on active listening and the depths to be explored within the grooves of great records. We sell and recommend physical products because of the tactile thrill of interacting with vinyl, jacket artwork and liner notes, and because to our ears a well-pressed record fed through a high-fidelity system sounds particularly awesome.\nBut we\u2019re not precious about it. A poorly-pressed piece of vinyl, for example, sounds particularly harsh on a nice system, and not all the new pressing plants coming onto the market are created equal.\nSo let\u2019s talk about high-fidelity music streaming platforms. From a sound standpoint, most major services have long weighed ease of delivery against quality of sound.

In Feb., 2019, the company launched in the U.S.\nUnlike the landing pages of Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal and Amazon Music, which promote hits and exploits marketing opportunities in conjunction with the major labels, Qobuz highlights new and old\u00a0 jazz, classical, opera, experimental \u2013 all the stuff often pushed into the stacks on the big services.\nPrice:$14.99 a month\nSales pitch, per Qobuz:\u201cHi-Res Audio is dedicated to audio files that deliver sound with a quality superior to that of a CD. These files are encoded with 24-Bit resolution (as opposed to 16-Bit for CD quality). This is also called studio quality because 24-Bit resolution is used in a recording studio. The difference in richness of sound and feeling is very substantial compared to MP3 files or even CD quality.\u201d Though not all the platform\u2019s offerings are available in 24-bit audio, the vast majority of them are available as 16-bit, CD quality files.\nView from inside:\u201cWhen modern music is being recorded today in almost any kind of digital studio environment, they\u2019re recording in a 24-bit audio format,\u201d says Dan Mackta, who represents Qobuz in North America. \u201cThat gives the engineers and producers tons of capabilities that didn\u2019t exist digitally a few years ago \u2014 or on tape ever, in terms of what you can do with recording. Incredible recordings in every genre are being made. But then, the equivalent of making a photocopy is what the consumer is going to get. That\u2019s the mainstream streaming experience. And there\u2019s really no reason for that because the bandwidth and the hardware exist \u2013 every factor is available to listen to the music in the same quality that it\u2019s recorded in, essentially. Why would you want it any other way, if you care about the music?\u201d\nCatalog:Qobuz offers the same volume and variety of music as the major services. But for In Sheep\u2019s Clothing heads, the following fact can\u2019t be stressed enough: Qobuz is the only streaming platform that offers EVERY SINGLE RELEASE FROM JOHN ZORN\u2019S TZADIK RECORDS. That means dozens of full-length albums from Zorn and his wide circle of peers, none of which has ever been released on vinyl or to streaming services.\nIt means Boredoms-related noise projects and a host of other Japanese experimental music of the \u201890s and \u201800s, early musique concrete experiments from Luc Ferrari, solo and collaborative guitar albums from Derek Bailey, Fred Frith, Bill Frisell, Marc Ribot. Otherwise unavailable works by Wadada Leo Smith, Jim O\u2019Rourke, Steve Coleman, Wayne Horvitz, Nana Vasconcelos and Jon Gibson. Percussion records from Susie Ibarra, Ikue Mori and Harry Partch.\nCheck below for a few albums from our collection that are available to stream in \u201cHi-Res Audio\u201d on Qobuz."

        "content": "It doesn\u2019t get any more \u2018state of the art\u2019 than this, and one could argue the audio gear found atCommon Wave Hi Fi, located in the Arts District in downtown Los Angeles, is art itself. As owner Wes Katzir powers up the Nagra HD amplification gear, he explains that the tubular phono pre-amp has to warm up, so while we are waiting he\u2019s gonna play some high resolution files through one of the best Digital Audio Converters (DACs) on the market.\nAfter enthusiastically telling me about the new YG Acoustics Sonja 2.2 speakers, which have just arrived at the store and stand nearly six feet tall, he shows me the intricately woven cable wires that attach to the tube amplifier. Everything in this system has been well imagined, with each component carefully chosen to work in unison.\nIn another listening room I\u2019m led to yet another cozy leather couch and asked to sit in the sweet spot. This is the shop\u2019s latest marquee \u201cwow\u201d system, and Wes is very excited to demo it for me.\nCommon Wave is a well appointed audio equipment store that also sells records and accessories. With its polished concrete floors and beams, stylized modern Danish furniture and perfectly placed Persian carpets throughout, think of it more like the most comfortable industrial loft living space you\u2019ve ever been in, only surrounded by exquisite stereo gear. This is where Wes\u2019 background in architectural design and sound comes in.\nWes has built within these walls an audiophile\u2019s dream, a highly curated, acoustically designed music den where people can come to listen to music on high-end audio equipment the way it was intended to be heard. Within the vast loft space are no less than six different listening setups, ready to be played and demoed, with at least one system playing music at all times.\nIf you\u2019re into Miles Davis, they have the perfect speakers for you. If classic rock is more your thing, there is a complete amp and turntable combo ready to be auditioned.\nAny preconceived notions that digital streaming is a compromised format are quickly put to rest. What I was hearing was about as close as you can get to the original source. The clarity and precision of the music was something I had never experienced before \u2014 like being in the room where the music was originally recorded. An experience that has to be heard in person to be believed, it was simply stunning.\nThen it was time to put a record on the \u2018piece de resistance\u2019 Kuzma Stabi R turntable, and Wes selected an LP by French flautist Aurele Nicolettes. While one of the quietest records I\u2019d\u00a0 ever heard, it also had a warmth and presence.\nCommon Wave is also a well stocked record shop that stocks audiophile pressings, including one of the largest MOFI (Mobile Fidelity) collections in the city. You can find reissued jazz records on Blue Note and Three Blind Mice alongside albums by Aphex Twin and Nine Inch Nails. A miscellaneous section with great selections under $10 and even a few $1 bins where you may be able to find some used gems.\nIn other words, there\u2019s something to be found for every music lover in this musical oasis here in DTLA. You can walk in and spend a buck or two on a couple records or drop a cool million dollars on the best sounding stereo system ever made. Wes spoke to In Sheep\u2019s Clothing about the shop.\nHow long have you been in business?\nSince 2016, and two years here at the new location downtown.\nHow is biz these days?\nInitially it was kind of frightening, but the minute we opened up by appointment things got steady again. And we\u2019ve seen an increase during this time, actually. People are spending more time at home and they\u2019re appreciating their home entertainment systems. There\u2019s definitely been an uptick in turntable sales.\nWhat do you guys do other than sell stereo equipment and records?\nWe do full system design and installation of audio systems. We specialize in home audio and cinema. We also do custom sound calibration and vintage equipment modulation and repair.\nHow has the customer base changed?\nIt was a lot traditional audiophiles types when we started, but now people who are looking for great sound in their home are also interested in design choices and what incorporates into their living space. Highly functioning furniture or objects of art, are more the way we liked to think of audio equipment. It\u2019s translated to a new group of clients that respect that hi-fi is an experience they want to live in. We want you to interact with the gear. It\u2019s a tactile object that should be showcased and translated into a tactile listening experience. We want it to live beautifully in your home. A lot of people hid their stereos with Bose mini systems in the 80\u2019s, and now again with Sonos speakers.\nWhat are the trends in the biz these days?\nWe see music lovers more than audiophiles per se. Clients have become younger and more excited to showcase their equipment and find the pure joy of music.\nIn what order would you put the importance of components?\nNo. 1 are speakers. The speakers interact with your ear, they interact with your room and they interact with the electronics, so it\u2019s the one that will determine your experience \u2014 based on your room and your tastes.\nNo. 2 is the Source (i.e. turntable, DAC, CD player). It is where the signal originates. The source is going to let the speakers do their best job.\nNo. 3 is the amplifier. The piece that bridges the source to the speakers.\nNo. 4 are cables. Never underestimate the importance of quality cables.\nWhat are your thoughts on the digital vs. analog debate?\nThat\u2019s a difficult question to answer. Digital is better in a lot of ways: It\u2019s clear and pure, and it\u2019s noise free, so there is so much information with more frequencies. It\u2019s the best format we\u2019ve ever come up with for detail.\nSo why deal in analog?\nWhile they may not have as much dynamic range as files, records just feel more real. The music comes off the grooves with a spacial tonality. If the record engineer has done his or her job correctly, the music is brought into clearer moments of focus. Things happen in space more naturally, and feels like the master tape. The analogy can almost be summed up by digital photography versus developing film: You may get a more precise and micro-focused photo with digital, but with film there will be more of an emotional pull. Our customers are 60% digital and 40% analog but again, turntable sales are on the rise.\nWhere do you think Hi-Fi is going?\nIt\u2019s really exciting to see something that was on the decline have such a resurgence. The craft of two-channel stereo is coming back in a big way. There is an enthusiasm from the public. They want to bring audio into their home and make it an experience \u2014 the way it used to be. More and more people want to get together, listen to and talk about music again.\nVisit Common Wave\u2019s website to book an appointment:https://www.commonwave.net/"

Maybe Alice Coltrane\u2019sWorld Galaxyhums differently than on vinyl or streaming platforms?\nPerhaps it sounds a little morelive, as if you\u2019re actually hearing the music inside of a space. That\u2019s because these recordings were made at In Sheep\u2019s Clothing using a pair of old ribbon microphones through a UAD Apollo AD converter to capture the sense of hearing records in that room. And that room was built with the intention of providing an optimal environment for serious listening. Since we opened, it has rewired a lot of brains.\nSoundsystem:\nKlipsch Klipschorn AK6 Loudspeakers\nAudio Note Jinro Shochu Tube Amplifier\nCondesa Carmen Rotary Mixer\nGarrard 301 Turntables\nThomas Schick Tonearms, Headshells & Cartridges\nRecording Engineer:Yohei Shikano\nThe Klipshorns needed to be situated in corners, so we built a separate set of corners in the room. Placing the speakers there provides a jumbo \u201csweet spot,\u201d one that\u2019s enhanced by the room\u2019s shape. Textured wood paneling covers most walls. Cork floors help prevent bounce.\nWe\u2019ve never claimed that this approach is better or best. We do believe strongly, though, that focused listening at ample volume in that room is a singular experience.\nOur intention with the (( ROOM RECORDINGS )) is to explore a new approach. Is it an analog recording? By definition, no. You\u2019re obviously hearing a digital replication. Still, while links to other streaming platforms will be provided for albums we are featuring, the (( ROOM RECORDINGS )) offer listeners a rich, atmospheric tone \u2014 hopefully a fresh perspective shaped by the space, the ribbon microphones and the sound system elements. We hope that these new recordings provide alternative listening experiences, or at least pose questions on how atmospheric elements shape the way we appreciate sound.\nNote: We are not collecting any income from these recordings and encourage our community to seek these albums out and purchase them for at-home listening pleasure."

        "title": "Audio Note UK\u2019s Quest: Perfect Sound Forever",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/audio-note-uk/",
        "content": "Here\u2019s Peter Qvortrup, founder of the respected British gear manufacturer Audio Note, discussing his company\u2019s overarching approach to quality: \u201cI think seeking perfection is a very powerful motivator. I have this strong conviction that music is really very poorly served by the equipment people buy.\u201d\nWhen In Sheep\u2019s Clothing first opened its Arts District doors in 2018, we were driven by similar conviction, one that pushed us to create an unparalleled listening experience in a comfortable room. One of our central components? Audio Note\u2019s Jinro Shochu amplifier. The central aim has always been to create spaces, whether at our current Sound & Vision pop-up at ROW DTLA or our listening events around the city, where music obsessives can gather with friends and colleagues, listen deeply in a group setting on stellar equipment and appreciate the nuances of sound in a way that was both immersive and intimate. To bring this vision to life at our West Hollywood headquarters, we recently once again turned to Qvortrup and his Audio Note team.\nLongtime friends of In Sheep\u2019s Clothing, Audio Note UK have set up a special dedicated listening room at our headquarters in West Hollywood. Earlier this month, we hosted the first intimate night of deep listening to classic albums from the ISC collection and invited guests to bring selections of their own. This exquisite experience was (literally, and precisely) amplified by Audio Note, and this remarkable Audio Note system will remain in our listening room. Expect a future series of talks and sessions in the room. The space will also serve potential buyers interested in demoing the speakers.\nTo amplify the philosophy and passion behind the company, which was founded in 1991, we sat down with Qvortrup and his AN colleague Adrian Ford-Crush. Qvortrup shared insights on everything from the impact of the pandemic on music listening habits to the unique qualities of Audio Note\u2019s products. His obsession with creating the ultimate listening experience is evident in every thought. The below transcript of our chat, which has been edited for length and clarity, touches on the nuances of high-fidelity sound, the evolution of audio technology and the future of immersive listening.\nRandall Roberts:So I started really developing a sense of listening on a nice system during the pandemic, and I\u2019m not alone. It allowed many people with the time and space to listen to \u2014 and hear \u2014 music in a different way. I\u2019m wondering whether in your experience, there\u2019s anything that separates this moment in time in the listening and hi-fidelity spheres and whether you feel like the pandemic changed anything for you?\nPeter Qvortrup:The pandemic has been a major game changer in a number of areas. I mean, behavioral mental health has definitely been affected by it. We saw an enormous increase in orders towards the end of the lockdown period, where people were really sitting at home. They weren\u2019t going on holiday. They were accumulating money in their bank accounts, and they were looking for something to spend it on. Quite a lot of them spent it on stereo equipment. So I think certainly the parts of the world where people were furloughed, and they sat at home and didn\u2019t work for 8, 12, 16 weeks or however long, I think there was definitely a marked increase in both sales but also people spending time in front of their stereo equipment. I know for a fact that I\u2019ve got a friend who\u2019s got a big record store in London, and he said that their online sales literally exploded, they couldn\u2019t get anywhere near what they were taking orders from.\nRR: Has that continued? Or was that a blip?\nPQ: It\u2019s definitely tailed off. I mean, it\u2019s funny because I sat and looked at the sales figures, and 2021 the sales of our products, the inflow of orders increased by well over 100%. And then it\u2019s been dropping off. 2022 was a little bit worse, 2023 was a little bit worse, and 2024 is now beginning to look like it might be picking up again.\nAdrian Ford-Crush: That\u2019s kind of returning to trend.\nPQ: I would say what\u2019s probably happened is that people have moved forward purchases that they would have done in 2023. That creates this sort of blip in sales. But whether the younger generation has bought on the same basis, I don\u2019t really know. What I do know is that I was at the London show this weekend. And there was a surprising number of people under 40s. And we went toAXPONA, and there was quite a reasonable number of young people there as well. That\u2019s the big show. On the other hand, the Tampa show, I would say the average age was 75.\nRR: The lines during Record Store Day in America are filled with Millennials and Gen Zers. So many young people buying records \u2014 and buying used records, interesting records. You would hope that means they\u2019re aware that the best way to listen to that is with a system.\nPQ: I agree with that. I think if you look at the 1950s, the people that were buying LPs in those days were the professional classes and people with money, i.e., people with a decent income. An LP in 1955 or 56 cost the same as a bus driver made in a week after tax. So you didn\u2019t get a lot of bus drivers buying LPs every week because they couldn\u2019t afford it. And if you take one of the more extreme examples, there was a set of records that came out in 1951 called Mozart Matins de Paris. It was released by a record company called The Discovery Fonset in France. That record cost the same as a surgeon made in a month, which also explains why they\u2019re so rare now.\nRR: Did you get your start listening to classical music?\nPQ: My father listened to classical music as a child, and it sort of carries over from that when you grow up with it. Pretty much anything and everything. I mean, if you go on YouTube and Google my name or Audio Note, you\u2019ll find quite a lot of stuff where we play heavy metal and thrash metal and psytrance and nightclub music and all sorts of other stuff. So you can pretty much do everything. But the percentage of the population that buys products like ours is relatively small.\nAnd it\u2019s not just the price issue. It\u2019s also the fact that you have to have a very specific interest in music and collecting music. It has to be a sort of central part of your quality of life, if you will. And I think that\u2019s always been the case. The people that can\u2019t afford to buy these, they go on and learn to play the piano, or the guitar or whatever. Before Edison invented the recordings, all the great arias were sung by the gondoliers in Venice. And by the way, I don\u2019t know whether you\u2019ve ever been to Milan, to La Scala, the opera house there. But at the back of the hall, you can get in for not a lot of money. And that\u2019s where the people that don\u2019t have a high income, but like opera and classical music in general, can buy tickets. I think when I went there once, and it\u2019s really tiring to stand there for a long opera, because you can\u2019t sit down, but it was very democratic in the sense that they allowed the part of the population to go in and listen to these great pieces of music.\nRR: I\u2019m curious, your products are cost-prohibitive to many people. Like you\u2019ve said, unless you\u2019re willing to cut corners elsewhere and not go on vacation, it\u2019s hard for many younger people to afford a high-quality system. Is that a business decision, or because quality gear is expensive to make?\nPQ: No, I would love to make something cheaper. It\u2019s just what I\u2019ve discovered over the 45 years I\u2019ve been doing this is that there is a lower limit, which is very difficult to break through. To make something that gives a fair representation of the software that you\u2019re playing, it really cannot be made much cheaper than our lowest priced products. A basic CD player with an amplifier and a pair of speakers and some relatively inexpensive cables, you\u2019re still looking at about $12,000. Of course, you can buy products that are made in Taiwan, or China, or wherever, but they don\u2019t really represent the music very well. And it doesn\u2019t mean that people shouldn\u2019t buy them, it just means that there\u2019s a limit to how you retain your interest in music. If the system doesn\u2019t do a good job, you don\u2019t spend as much time in front of the stereo equipment as you might want to under ideal circumstances.\nRR: Can you talk about the systems that you\u2019ve helped set up for In Sheep\u2019s Clothing?\nPQ: All of the equipment we make is tube-based. We don\u2019t use any transistors in anything. So they\u2019ve got an integrated amplifier called a Meishu. They\u2019ve got our TT-3 turntable, which is a suspended three-motor turntable. It\u2019s quite a striking design. They have a CD 4.1x player, and then they have AN-E speakers, which are our larger full-range speakers. A very nice system to get down.\nRR: I\u2019d like to read you a quote that you said one time. You said, \u201cI started to realize probably 20 years ago that I can instantly recognize when I think something is better. And it\u2019s very rare that I\u2019m wrong.\u201d Can you talk about the most recent audio-related experience that stands out to you?\nPQ: We developed a speaker using electromagnets. So when I heard the first pair of those, which is a couple of years ago now, the very early prototypes, I mean, it was, you know, we talk about a Damascus Road experience kind of thing. And this was one a confirmation of what I hoped would happen, or what I hoped I\u2019d hear. It was also revelatory in the sense that it was just so much better than what I had, which were more than twice the price of my system at home. And, you know, that kind of experience, I\u2019ve had quite a few of those over the years. But we\u2019ve spent a lot of time and money developing things with this specific target to make them do something that we hadn\u2019t heard before. The deeper that persistence digs into the software, the more you hear of the actual original event, whether it\u2019s a construction in a studio, or whether it\u2019s a live event. In most cases, the live events have a little bit more, what do we say, interesting information in them. But it\u2019s not always the case. There are studio recordings that do a very good job of this.\nWhat\u2019s particularly interesting is, for me at least, I started listening to a friend in Russia who did some very good transfers from 78s, mainly classical music. The sound of those as the equipment has gotten better over time, as we\u2019ve improved the D to A converters and the CD transports and so on, what\u2019s becoming obvious is that there is something in these recordings that we don\u2019t get from modern recordings. There\u2019s a kind of authenticity or life to the performance.\nWe are very obsessed. I can recommend a book that talks about this more generally, the science and so on. It\u2019s calledVoltaire\u2019s Bastards. The subtitle isThe Dictatorship of Reason in the West. We have this sort of idea in the West that with pure reasoning and logic, you can think something through and arrive at the right conclusion. Most of our societies are based on this idea, that if we think this through properly, we will end up with the right conclusion. One of the problems as a society that we have now is that this is clearly not working. You\u2019ve been a journalist, so you should be more than familiar with this particular concept. But the 78 RPM records, one of the things we realized just before COVID was that when we use the 78 transfers on a CDR, it\u2019s actually easier in many respects to hear the differences, whether something is better or worse, when you do a comparison.\nI\u2019ve been thinking about this a great deal over the last seven, eight years, after we started realizing that this was the case. The only couple of things I can really think about is in the 1930s, 1920s, 1910s, the 78 RPM transfers had a very short distance between the actual performance and laying down the software. To take an acoustic 78, there might be a couple of meters between the singer, the piano, or whatever it was you\u2019re recording, and the needle that cuts the software. And yes, there are issues with coloration, noise, and so on. But there is something tangible sitting in these recordings that we don\u2019t seem to be able to capture the same way with all our advanced technology and our microphones and our digital workstations and so on. And I will probably spend the rest of my days trying to figure out how to explain this.\nRR: Yes.\nPQ: I think one of my big takeaways with audio and the audio manufacturing industry as a whole is that they completely disregard the music that\u2019s on 78s because it\u2019s cosmetically aged, noisy, and there are bandwidth issues and some phase problems. But at the end of the day, 50, maybe 60% of the greatest classical performances sit on 78s.\nRR: Right, right.\nPQ: The same applies to jazz. And if you look at blues, for example, it\u2019s even worse. It\u2019s like 90% of the greatest blues sits on 78s. There are the recordings with Leadbelly and Blind Lemon Jefferson and all these old blues artists. All of that is on 78s.\nRR: And Enrico Caruso\u2019s stuff is on wax cylinder.\nPQ: Some of it\u2019s on wax cylinder. He died in 1921. I mean, I\u2019ve got several things that he recorded during the First World War.\nRR: I did a story on wax cylinder collectors and a wax cylinder repair person in Los Angeles. Amazing guy. He is a dentist actually. It\u2019s a long story, but he\u2019s a dentist who in his nighttime hours uses the same tools during his daytime hours to repair wax cylinders. He found that the same adhesives used for your teeth work really well on wax cylinders.\nPQ: The problem with the wax cylinder is that they harden over time. Even if you can repair them, actually repairing them may not solve the problem. I saw a TV program with a talk show host, and he was showing\u2026 It wasn\u2019t too long ago. He said something like, \u201cThis is the only known one.\u201d And then he takes it and literally, I think he just grabbed it too hard, and it literally disintegrated.\nOne of the reasons why they went away from wax cylinders was that they were too fragile. They knew this already in the 1890s. This is how we ended up with the flat disc. And of course, a lot of people who write to me say, \u201cWell, you know, replaying a flat disc is a lot more difficult because the distance that is traveled on the outside is much longer than on the inside and that means it\u2019ll compress the data and it\u2019ll do all sorts of things.\u201d All of which is true. But I don\u2019t think we would have anything like the catalog that we have available to us now if everything was on cylinders.\nRR: More difficult to store too.\nPQ: When Edison invented it, he didn\u2019t do it to record music. They did it so someone would read a letter to somebody, and the secretary would then take a cylinder and type it. So you didn\u2019t need stenographers to sit there and write. It was not done as a data file. The idea was never that it was supposed to record symphony orchestras.\nRR: I could talk on and on about this topic. Can we jump ahead to the future? What\u2019s your experience with the new formats like 3D immersive listening and spatial audio? Have you experienced that much? What are your thoughts?\nPQ: It is nonsense, to be perfectly honest. It was tried already; quadrophonic recordings came out in the 1970s. One, they didn\u2019t sound much good, and it was very difficult to get a cartridge to track them. And of course, we can solve that, which is an audio bug again. Why would you want to do that? And all this idea that it has to be immersive\u2026 immersive what? I can get very immersed sitting listening to an old recording of Debussy in my car on my way to my house in France. That immerses me perfectly. I don\u2019t need\u2026 It\u2019s all crap. Again, it\u2019s a little bit like, there\u2019s a boundary, I think, that they are constantly trying to bypass, and it really doesn\u2019t do anything to the experience. It might make the engineers or developers very excited about it, and the idiots that sell it just as excited about it. But at the end of the day, there really isn\u2019t much to get excited about. Well-recorded music reproduced on two speakers, that\u2019s about as far as it goes. All of this other stuff is just marketing hype as far as I\u2019m concerned. No, sorry to be a Luddite.\nAFC: Oh, no, no, that\u2019s my question.\nPQ: I just don\u2019t see it having any relevance at all to the musical experience.\nNote: For those interested in listening to the Audio Note system at our headquarters, send an email to[email\u00a0protected]"

We have some excellent suggestions below $500 that are proven performers.\nShould you always go with a new deck or can a restored vintage turntable also deliver excellent sonic results?\nI have used three restored Thorens turntables fromVinyl Nirvanaover the past decade and whilst the return on investment has been excellent \u2014 none of these options were inexpensive when you factored in the custom hardwood plinths, tonearms, and associated cartridges.\nThe minimum investment in one of these turntables is around $1,800 USD.\nThe build quality on all of these turntables that were originally made in the 1970s is excellent and there have been zero issues with reliability or parts \u2014 Dave Archambault has enough to last many years of service.\nBut for most people \u2014 a new turntable probably makes the most sense.\nThere is a lot of competition below $600 and I was fortunate last year to try a number from Rega, Pro-Ject, Fluance, and Andover Audio. The level of performance that can be squeezed out of an entry-level deck is surprising, but for most people \u2014 they just want to set it up and listen.\nI wasn\u2019t really blown away by theSpinDeckbut theSpinDeck Maxis a completely different table that is manufactured in Germany for Andover. The automatic design just feels more substantial and it\u2019s built to a much higher standard; which includes the tonearm and rather beefy platter.\nThe supplied Ortofon OM10 is fine but I swapped it out for aGrado Prestige Red3which just sounds fuller and less bright in my office system. The SpinDeck Max is not a fancy deck but it comes across as slightly more authoritative sounding with excellent pace in most systems. It can also be tweaked with a cork platter fromAnalog Restorationsand certainly benefits from some isolation. You might be surprised at what this deck can do with a better cartridge andphono preamplifier.\nWhere to buy:$599$399at\u00a0andoveraudio.com|Amazon\nHaving spent three months with theDebut Prowhich proved to be one of my favorite products of 2022, I\u2019m more than confident to recommend it to anyone in the $1,000 range. Inflation has pushed everything higher but I\u2019d still spend the extra money on this one.\nHaving compared the Debut Pro to all 6 tables that I have at home which includes the aforementionedThorens decks, aNAD C 588,Yamaha YP-701, and a mystery deck that is currently under review \u2014 the Debut Pro is an excellent deck that can be tweaked to a very high level of performance. Consider this to be the best currently available under $1,000.\nPro-Ject has the ability to manufacture almost anything and the new tonearm and very inert platter elevate this table in a very substantial way; it sounds far more forceful and dynamic compared to theDebut EVOtables that lack some bottom end weight and presence in comparison.\nThe supplied Sumiko cartridge works well but swapping that out for theSumiko WellfleetorBlue Point No. 3is a very worthwhile upgrade.\nRead my Pro-Ject Debut Pro review hereorwatch our video review here.\nWhere to buy:$999at Amazon|Crutchfield|Turntable Lab\nThe little engine that could is tucked away in a suburb outside of Boston, and after almost 10 years old it is hard not to be impressed by what Ben Carter and the folks atU-Turn Audiohave accomplished.\nThe newU-Turn Audio Orbit Theory Turntableis a huge milestone for the company that has focused on the market below $400 for most of their existence.\nWhen I visited the company almost 7 years ago, it was impossible not to notice that they were struggling with the sheer volume of orders and that they needed to find better domestic sources for their platters, plinths, and motors.\nCarter and I discussed the rationale for the price structure of their tables and the possibility of manufacturing something in the $700 USD range.\nThere was already the desire to make something like the Orbit Theory and take on Rega and Pro-Ject, but that required more capital, employees, and the ability to create a tonearm that would be a major upgrade over the tonearm on the existing Orbit.\nThe new U-Turn Audio Orbit Theory is $999 USD \u2014 you can also order a version with their internal phono stage for $1,069.\nThe focus with the new Orbit Theory is clearly on the tonearm, motor, and construction of the plinth.\nFor the Theory Orbit turntable, U-Turn decided that they needed to take their OA2 gimbal bearing design to the next level by further reducing points of resonance in the tonearm. Practically speaking, this meant using more rigid materials and minimizing the number of connection points between parts.\nThe new motor and pulley are so quiet that they can be mounted directly to the plinth, ensuring perfect belt alignment. The motor is electronically controlled by a DC-powered sine wave generator \u2013 this provides very stable platter speed and gives you the ability to change between 33/45 RPM with the turn of a knob.\nTheory\u2019s acrylic platter is frosted, and all of platter surfaces have been precision machined for maximal flatness and minimal runout. They have also machined a groove into the platter to keep the belt in place.\nWhat better way to celebrate a new turntable than with a new finish? For Theory, U-Turn decided to do real hardwood plinths, but wanted to spice things up a bit. Ebonization is a traditional finishing process that turns wood black without staining or painting.\nHow does it sound?\nBold. Precise. Far more substantial than any of the decks they have produced before and with excellent tonal weight and speed.\nWhere to buy:$999at uturnaudio.com\nTechnics has been very aggressive during the vinyl revolution introducing a number of new models that have sold out in some markets within weeks. The brand has a proven track record with both DJs and audiophiles and even itstop models that sell for more than $3,000 USDhave continued to sell well.\nThe SL-1500C sits in the middle of the Technics product lineup and hasbeen available since 2019. However, looks like it isn\u2019t going away anytime soon as Technics, instead of offering to replace it has decided to offer a new color option in addition to the standard silver and black,the SL-1500C will also be available inmatte white (SL-1500C-W).\nWith its minimalistic look, the SL-1500C-W is designed for great performance and ease of use supported by the following key features.\nThe SL-1500C-W incorporates acoreless direct drive brushless DC motor. This allows for a stable rotation that is free from \u201ccogging.\u201d\nThe two-layer platter provides improved vibration-damping performance.\nThe highly sensitive S-shaped aluminum tonearm accurately reads record grooves; an S-Shaped tonearm has an equal mass on both sides of its pivot point.\nIn addition to its S-shape the tone features Auto-lift. This minimizes needle wear-out and preserves records.\nThe SL-1500C-W has a high-rigidity cabinet and a high-damping insulator for the thorough shut-out of vibrations. This ensures smooth tracking.\nWhat makes this deck unique?\nFantastic speed stability, combined with rather rugged construction and a solid tonearm make it a reliable platform for a wide range of cartridges. We\u2019ve listened to this range of decks with Ortofon, Hana, Grado, and Golding cartridges and you might be surprised how well it performs with $750 to $2,000 cartridges. It also elevates the performance of less expensive cartridges making it a great platform that you can upgrade over time.\nWhere to buy:$1,299at Crutchfieldin black (SL-1500C-K), silver (SL-1500C-S), or white (SL-1500C-W)\nRega\u2019s iconic turntables have been in production for 50 years and would make any credible list of high-end audio components that have changed the industry. Rega has also sold hundreds of thousands of tonearms over the past 5 decades; audiophiles have purchased OEM versions of its tonearms from a number of brands including Michell, Origin Live, Moth Audio, and Goldring.\nIn 1977, Rega introduced the Planar 2 and Planar 3 turntables, which were an evolution of the Planet turntable. The Planar 3 was designed to be a higher-end version of the Planar 2, with better build quality and performance.\nThe Planar 3 had a glass platter, a low-noise motor, and a new tonearm. The new Rega-Acos R200 tonearm was a radical departure from the standard tonearms of the time.\nIt was a lightweight design that used a unipivot bearing, which allowed it to track the record groove more accurately. The Planar 3 was an instant success and quickly gained a reputation for its excellent sound quality and value for money.\nOver the years, Rega has continued to refine and improve the Planar 3 turntable. In 1983, they introduced the RB300 tonearm, which was a significant upgrade over the original tonearm. The RB300 used a more rigid tube and a more advanced bearing system, which improved tracking accuracy and reduced distortion.\nIn 1991, Rega introduced the P3 turntable, which was an updated version of the Planar 3 with a new motor, platter, and tonearm. In 2000, Rega introduced the P3-24, which had a new 24-volt motor and a new plinth design.\nIn 2016, Rega introduced a new version of the Planar 3, which had a new RB330 tonearm, a new plinth design, and improved motor control circuitry.\nAvailable in the hugely popular new walnut effect finish, the 50th anniversary Planar 3 is supplied with a hand tunedNeo PSU MK2and the handmade RegaExact moving magnet cartridgefactory fitted.\nFor those looking to upgrade this Planar 3, there is a new cartridge option just released by Rega at High End Munich 2024 that looks like a big upgrade over the Exact.\nAccording to Rega, theNd3will offer between 5 and 6mV of output (which feels somewhat ambiguous) and requires 1.75 grams of tracking force. The headshell uses 3 points for attachment making it ideal for Rega\u2019s own tonearms.\nEachNd3is hand-made by Rega\u2019s skilled technicians in the UK factory. The design uses brand new generator geometry with perfect symmetry to achieve highly accurate channel balance. TheNd3also has an optimized pole gap for superior linearity and cross talk characteristics.\nThe complete assembly is housed in a zero tolerance Injection moulded glass filled polyphenylene sulphide body (PPS) which is a lightweight and highly rigid material. A low mass body reduces stress on the tonearm bearings and aids free movement which is critical in accurate vinyl replay.\nThis new body design was inspired by Rega\u2019s existing range of MC cartridges.\nThe drive system uses theirreference drive beltand a custom CNC\u2019d aluminium drive pulley to deliver the absolute best in performance and accuracy.\nThe Anniversary Edition is completed with an aluminium lid plinth badge and smoked dustcover to complete the Anniversary Edition.\nWhat makes this deck special?\nIf you put enormous value on tempo, clarity, detail, and a very open sounding presentation \u2014 the Rega is very hard to beat.\nThe expressive nature of this deck is second-to-none at the price.\nWhere to buy:$1,695at Music Direct(limited availability)\nTip: The regular Planar 3 (without cartridge) starts at$1,125at Turntable LabandAudio Advice\nDoes balanced really make a difference?\nMy experience suggests that it does if you have to contend with certain noise issues.\nAlmost 22 years ago, I invested in a very expensive turntable and felt that I had reachedvinyl nirvana. I paid a professional $200 to properly install the cartridge, setup the table which had a finicky suspension system, and help me mount the turntable shelf to the wall.\nMy building at the time was a pre-war in downtown Toronto that needed an upgrade on the electrical front. Noisy to say the least.\nNo matter what I tried, my turntable setup always sounded noisy; ground loop issues, constant hiss, and it became a a source of depression (first world problems). Why bother spending almost $8,000 on such a system if it sounded terrible.\nA local dealer suggested that I have my arm and table modified so that I could run a fully balanced rig; which also included upgrading to a balanced phono stage. I sold a few other items to facilitate the changes.\nExtreme? Perhaps.\nBut when I listened to the same records that mattered to me \u2014 I was stunned by the differences in clarity, noise floor, and overall dynamics of the sound.\nDoes a balanced setup always sound better? Not necessarily and I\u2019m not convinced that every manufacturer who markets \u201cbalanced\u201d is really offering that.\nThePro-Ject X2 Boffers both single-ended and balanced connection options, but you do need to use an MC cartridge for a balanced setup.\nIs there a huge gap between theDebut PROand the X2 B? Fair question.\nIf running the same MM cartridge like aSumiko Wellfleet, I would still give the edge to the X2 B when it comes to impact and overall resolution, but the gap isn\u2019t enormous.\nHowever, when running aMC cartridgeinto one of the Pro-Ject balanced phono pre-amplifiers or something like theMoon by Simaudio 610LP\u2014 the gap between the two tables is rather enormous.\nThe clarity, bass impact, soundstage depth and width, and overall dynamics of the system totally changes.\nThe Pro-Ject X2 B goes from being a very good $1,799 turntable to a rather exceptional table that can compete with some tables in the $2,500 to $3,000 range and I\u2019ve heard enough $3,000 tables to know.Read my in-depth review here.\nWhere to buy:$1,599at Crutchfield|Turntable Lab\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission."

        "content": "Featured in Philip Arneill\u2019sTokyo Jazz Jointsbook, DownBeat is one of the classic jazz kissas located in the historical port side block neighborhood of Yokohama\u2019s bar district Noge. Like many post-war establishments in Yokohama, which is known as the birthplace of jazz in Japan, DownBeat first became popular by catering to American soldiers working at U.S. military facilities around the city. The original space hosted live jazz nights performed mostly by American soldiers that soon became frequented by Japanese residents who admired the music for its sense of freedom.\nAfter relocating in 1968, DownBeat has since focused more on their vinyl collection, which traces the history of modern jazz from the swing and bebop era in the \u201950s all the way to contemporary jazz. The 3000+ vinyl collection includes albums from famous American labels such as Blue Note, Impulse, and Prestige, European labels such as ECM, MPS, and ENJA, along with contemporary records from around the world. \u201cAfter decades of repeated use, the jackets are worn and peeling\u2026 [the current owner] Mr. Yoshihisa combines the tattered records with current new releases to create the atmosphere of the store with a \u2018Downbeat-like\u2019 selection of music.\u201d\nA small and intimate space, DownBeat seats around 20-30 people with lounge style seating and minimal, moody lighting. Music is clearly the intention at this establishment, and the sound has been noted to be so loud that conversation can be difficult (amazing). The sound system itself is quite classic for jazz kissas from this era and features a Sony direct drive turntable, Shure V15 cartridge, Accuphase amplifier, and Altec A7 Voice of Theater loudspeakers. A cloud-shaped acoustic panel is attached to the ceiling, and covered with clippings from the Down Beat magazine. Oil paintings of Art Blakey, Oscar Peterson, Sonny Rollins, Miles Davis, and other legends line the walls. \u201cSmoked by cigarette smoke, they are now more like tar paintings than oil paintings, which makes them even more valuable.\u201d\nIn recent years, DownBeat has become even more popular, bringing in a younger generation of fans. Niew Media\u2019s Mitsutaka Nagira writes, \u201cWhy is such a long-established store attracting attention now? The answer lies in the presence of Shuhei Yoshihisa, who now runs the store as the owner. Downbeat, which has been in business for 68 years this year, was run by its first owner, Hayato Anbo, until the 1990s. When Mr. Yasuho passed away, Kohei Tanaka, a long-time regular customer, took over the business to ensure its survival. Later, when Mr. Tanaka, the second-generation owner, decided to let the restaurant go, the current owner, Mr. Yoshihisa, who became the young owner in his 30s, was also a regular customer who had been coming to Downbeat since his student days. In other words, Downbeat is a jazz cafe that has been preserved by regulars who know the atmosphere and music selection trends. It\u2019s easy to see how the atmosphere has been preserved by the three owners over its long history. It is not only about the time-traveling space. The most important point lies in its music selection.\u201d\nPurchase the latestJazz Kissa 2022-2023by Katsumasa Kusunose:https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/product/katsumasa-kusunose-jazz-kissa-2022-2023-book/"

        "content": "Founded in 1933 by a 20-year old jazz lover named Mamoru Yoshida, Jazz Cafe Chigusa in Yokohama has long held the title of the oldest standing jazz kissa in Japan. One of the first of its kind to open at the dawn of Japanese jazz in the \u201930s when kissa culture was just beginning, Chigusa (which translates to \u201cAutumn Leaves\u201d) remains a historic cultural landmark that has miraculously survived over the decades through multiple wars and re-developments. Listed on their website, Chigusa\u2019s mission is \u201cto inherit and promote jazz culture by overcoming many hardships.\u201d\nThe cafe has been closed and rebuilt a number of times, including during World War II when the building and 6,000 records were destroyed in the Yokohama air raid. After Chigusa\u2019s destruction, Yoshida returned from military service in 1947, collected over 1,000 more records, and restarted Chigasu. The jazz cafe would later close once again in 2007 when the second location had to be sold to developers. In 2012, a group of long-time fans and locals led by regular Masataka Yusare successfully resurrected Chigusa close to where it was originally opened in 1933 by Yoshida, who died in 1994 aged 81. For the past few years, Chigusa has been under reconstruction and slated to be re-opened in 2024 as \u201cJazz Museum Chigusa.\u201d\nThe spirit of Chigusa lives on over the decades through the lasting impact of founder Mamoru Yoshida, who grew up around U.S. military bases in Yokohama and fell in love with jazz while enjoying the sounds of Toshiko Akiyoshi, Sadao Watanabe, and Terumasa Hino at clubs. He devoted himself completely to studying jazz and would apparently spend 30 to 40% of his salary on importing records from the United States. The music in the collection ranges from old-time swing to \u201980s fusion and modern, experimental jazz. Photos of legends like Duke Ellington, Charles Mingus, Wayne Shorter, Ron Carter, Mal Waldron, Thelonious Monk, Joe Zawinul, and others line the walls along with numerous signed autographs from esteemed visitors. It is said that famous musicians would often visit Chigusa to listen and even take advice from Yoshida, who was renowned across Japan for his deep understanding of jazz.\nBelow, watch a calming tribute video (shot in 2022 shortly before the last location had to be closed) that perfectly captures the feeling of stepping into Chigusa during a cloudy afternoon, drinking coffee, and listening to jazz records on the massive custom-built soundsystem."

        "content": "Despite being more than a half-century old, the information delivered in Introduction to Hi-Fi, a 1960 book on the basics of sound reproduction and high fidelity listening at home, remains relevant to anyone looking to better understand the magic behind great stereophonic sound. In it, British writer Clement Brown explains in simple, everyday language the way stuff works. He moves from amplifier to cartridge to speaker and beyond, writing about the mechanics of audio reproduction and essential information for the stereo-curious to absorb. The goal: Providing information that allows you to get the most out of your records.\nIs it the most entertaining writing you\u2019ve ever encountered? Nope. It\u2019s quite dry, very staid, and written not to spark joy but convey info. As he writes in the intro:\nThis book has been written by a music-lover who hopes that his contribution to the cause of high quality sound reproduction will encourage others to take an interest in it. The author has concentrated on guidance and information which an association with both musicians and engineers has shown to be of practical value when considering the possibility of good sound in the home. The depth of one\u2019s pocket has not been overlooked in describing the desirable features of high fidelity equipment for reproduction from records, tape and radio.\nAvailable on the fantastic archival magazine siteWorldRadioHistory, the book offers perspective for a few different types of readers, most notably the kind of listener, writes Brown, \u201cwho has little opportunity or inclination to attend concerts. We need not be surprised at the size of this group when we consider the vast repertoire of recordings available for playing at home and the many hours of broadcasting each day.\u201d\nSixty-four years later, an infinite number of online broadcasting hours occurs each day, but the truth remains that for the concert-starved outside of major entertainment centers, deep listening on hi-fi systems fills a deep need.\nBrown begins with some very simple stuff that bears repeating:\n\u201cFirst, it should be clearly understood that high fidelity results are not likely to be obtained from a single unit of furniture. Much is sacrificed when the loudspeaker is mounted in the same cabinet as other, equally vital parts, and the novice should remember that a separately housed loudspeaker is a fundamental requirement. This means a minimum of two pieces of furniture. With the wide range of elegant and often inexpensive cabinets now available, however, there should be no difficulty in finding an arrangement to meet individual tastes. Secondly, most of the components of a high fidelity installation \u2014 amplifiers, pick-ups, loudspeakers and so on \u2014 are sold separately for the enthusiast to incorporate in his own installation.\u201d\nHe defines sound in a precisely conveyed paragraph:\nSound is the effect on the ear of variations in air pressure. It can travel in various mediums, but we are concerned only with its propagation in air, in which it has avelocity of 1,100 ft. per second (approximately). The pressure variations are caused by an object vibrating and subjecting the surrounding air to alternate compression and rarefaction. The air particles are thus agitated backwards and forwards in the path of what we call the sound wave.\nA perfect scroll-through time-passer for those on jury duty, in waiting rooms, or chilling on a Monday night, you\u2019ll exit this book knowing a lot more about hi-fi systems and strategies for improving the sound in your life.\nTo get a better sense of the knowledge available in Intro to Hi-Fi, here\u2019s an index page.\nReadIntroduction to Hi-Fiby Clement Brownhere."

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/varia-instruments/",
        "content": "Speaking with ISC from his workshop in Berne, Switzerland, Varia Instruments co-founder Simon Sch\u00e4r is beaming with energy. After a 10-hour day assembling various mechanical components, stress-testing electrical parts, welding cylinders, and fulfilling a long-waiting list of international orders, the telltale signs of fatigue are nowhere to be found in Simon\u2019s lively demeanor. Before the interview gets underway, Simon takes me on a virtual tour of the workshop. He introduces me to his coworkers, explaining the different assembly processes and protocols, and excitedly shows off the newest addition to the Varia Instruments breakroom: a recently completed DJ booth built from scratch by one of Simon\u2019s friends.\nFor the past 9 years, Simon and his business partner, Marcel Schneider, have been building some of the finest rotary DJ mixers on the market: the 2-channel RDM20 and the 4-channel RDM40. In addition to the two mixers, Varia Instruments offers the TTW10 \u2013 a hand cut, precision turntable weight that doubles as a 45 adapter. From concept to completion, all of Varia Instruments\u2019 products are hand-built and carefully assembled by a small team of engineers and music lovers in Marcel and Simon\u2019s hometown of Berne.\nVaria Instruments products are praised for their sleek design, stout durability, range of features, and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 their excellent and robust sound quality. Louie Vega, Jeff Mills, Gerd Janson, and Osunlade are just a few of the many DJs who have offered glowing reviews of Varia Instruments\u2019 high-end audio gear. Lucky for us, Varia Instruments\u2019 RDM20 has also found a home with ISC at our listening bar in New York City.\nMy interview with Simon came to fruition after receiving a DM from the Varia Instruments Instagram account inquiring about a photo I shot of the RDM40. Shortly after, Simon and I began exchanging messages, sharing mixes, sending photos of records we love, and chatting about music. Eventually Simon set aside time from his busy schedule to speak with In Sheep\u2019s Clothing about the origins of Varia Instruments, the similarities and differences of analog culture around the world, and the challenges and rewards of building a business with passion. The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\nAndrew Lowell (In Sheep\u2019s Clothing): Let\u2019s start from the beginning. What were the origins of Varia Instruments. How did it all start?\nSimon Sch\u00e4r: Well, really Varia Instruments was born out of a huge coincidence. It almost felt like it was meant to be. I\u2019ve been DJing for half of my life \u2013 17 years ago now \u2013 and you know, you make this development when you first start DJing. First you get records from the flea markets, then you discover Discogs and record stores. And the same development occurs with the equipment. I started with a shitty Hitachi turntable, and at a certain point I bought another turntable, and slowly I built my setup until eventually I managed to have two proper DJ turntables, some speakers that were given to me by my dad and I was truly satisfied with everything but the mixer. I used to have an old Vestax PMC 05 Pro 2, which is really a hiphop battle mixer, before I got a Vestax PMC25 with an isolator on it. But I was never really happy with the quality or the features. There were things that were missing or not nicely done. So I began searching for the right mixer, which was sort of an endeavor. The quality wasn\u2019t good enough, or some features were missing, or it was too expensive, or I had no chance to test it.\nAL: What were some of the features that you felt were missing?\nSS:In particular, I really wanted to have a full isolator on the channel, not only an EQ. And it had to be three bands: bass, middle and treble \u2013 not only bass and treble. I also wanted to have a cue mix, which wasn\u2019t available on all mixers. At the time, there wasn\u2019t really a DJ mixer out there with isolators on each channel. I couldn\u2019t find a single model. Nowadays, a few other brands are doing it, but I think Varia is one of the first companies that somehow came up with that feature.\nSo as I was going through this search, I began speaking with friends and fellow DJs until eventually I spoke with my friend Marc who suggested that I reach out to someone named \u201cMarcel\u201d who made a prototype of some sort of DJ mixer. And I was like, \u201cWait a second, who is Marcel? I don\u2019t know this guy.\u201d Imagine, there was a person in the same town, at the same time, doing this very particular thing I was looking for. When I called him, he was very open to meeting and showing me his creation.\nAL: This was in 2015?\nSS:Yes, November 2015. Marcel invited me over to his place to check out the prototype and I went there with a list \u2013 like literally, I wrote out a list of all of the features I wanted in my dream mixer and when I first saw Marcel\u2019s prototype, it checked every single box on my list. The isolator on the channel, the master isolator, the cue mix \u2013 everything was there. And it was a super nice machine already. I expected it to be some sort of cardboard box with some cheap knobs on it. So I was totally blown away. Plus, Marcel and myself, we got along really well almost right away. Quickly I asked him if he would be willing to help me build a mixer for myself and he told me, \u201cSure, let\u2019s do it, I\u2019m happy to help you.\u201d After some discussions, we decided to not only build one mixer for myself, but to build a batch of 10 mixers with the idea that we could sell one here and there to our friends.\nShortly after we met, we began to work on it. First we did some revisions on the original prototype. We did proper branding and everything, but it was very much a project. It was never the idea like, \u201cHey, that\u2019s our business idea let\u2019s build a company.\u201d So by the time we finished those first ten mixers, they were already sold out. During the process, when we were building everything, people started to call us. You know, like, \u201cHey, my friend told me that you\u2019re building mixers now, is that true?\u201d and we\u2019d be like \u201cYeah, we\u2019re trying\u201d and they\u2019d go \u201cI\u2019ll take one!\u201d\nAL: What was your role in the beginning, since you mentioned that Marcel already built this original prototype? Was there any sort of technical component that you were adding to the process of building this first run of mixers?\nSS:All of the electronic design is done by Marcel himself. He\u2019s like the mastermind of Varia Instruments, because he\u2019s an electronics engineer. Plus he\u2019s a sound engineer. And my part is the mechanics. I did an apprenticeship in mechanics, so I could bring in my knowledge on the hardware side of things, especially the housing of the mixer, the face plates, etc. But I was also just another creative mind, another perspective on what DJing is, how to use it, and ways it could be improved. It really is the Dream Team: Marcel with his deep knowledge of electronics, about audio technology; my background with the more mechanical things, with the creative side of things, and together it works very well.\nAL: You built the first ten mixers and they've all sold out. What was the next step?\nSS:We were pretty surprised about all of the new orders coming in and decided soon after to do another run. It really started picking up, and there was some real demand. Step by step we went further down the road. We increased the order quantities for all the materials and after a couple months we began to enlarge our tiny workshop. And something we\u2019ve done since the very beginning is to optimize wherever we see room for improvements: It may be a step in the production line, a new component that results in better quality, or a process that could run smoother afterwards.\nWe never stop exploring. Marcel and I aren\u2019t the risky business types either. The way we went really suits us \u2013 better many small steps towards the right direction than thinking big and finding investors and doing weird things to expand profits. After a while, Marcel quit his job. Another year later, I quit my job as well. It all grew very organically, and it still does.\nAL: It's wild to think that when the business with Marcel started growing, you guys only knew each other for a few years. What was it like quitting your job and going into business with someone who was, essentially, a new person in your life? Did you ever have any hesitation like, \u201cMan, I don't really know this guy. Could he screw me over?\u201d\nSS:I was never worried about that, because Marcel and I have very open communication and honesty is very important for both of us. I mean, we are similar in a lot of ways, but we also share some differences as well. He is a pretty calm, quiet person, and I\u2019m more like the loud, extroverted guy. Even our interests are different. But somehow it was almost like fate brought us together and these differences between us are all really healthy because you always need to discuss things, share your perspectives, and you have to find your path together. It\u2019s really helpful in a way.\nAL: So you guys have built the RDM20. How were you selling these? Still word of mouth, or were you marketing it yet?\nSS:Yeah, the RDM 20 was our first product. And even when we were building those 10 mixers I mentioned earlier, we made an effort to somehow do it properly and to create a brand. My girlfriend at the time was a graphic designer, so we got her to make a proper logo, we built a website, we shot some nice photos, but we never expected it to go this way. It was always more of a fun project than a business.\nAL: When did you start development on the other Varia Instruments products? Specifically, the turntable weights and the RDM40.\nSS:Two years after that first run of mixers, we began working on our turntable weight: the TTW10. And again\u2013this was a product that we developed out of a need from ourselves. Also around this time, the first clubs began contacting us and asking if we had a 4-channel mixer available. At first we didn\u2019t feel it was necessary (as you can connect up to four line sources and two turntables to the RDM 20), but as time went on, our opinion began to change. I think we were up for a new challenge, and there was some real demand for a 4-channel model. So, we started to sketch, then we built models out of cardboard boxes, later with CNC milled wood parts. This early process of creating something from scratch has an incredible magic to it and it\u2019s without a doubt what I like most about my job!\nAnyway, from the first drawings of the RDM40 to the final product, it took around three years. That\u2019s a long time, but we had to keep up with the production line for the RDM20 and the turntable weights, too \u2013 busy times!\n\u201cI think the most difficult part is to create a product with a top quality standard, which pays our bills on one side, but is affordable for the DJs out there.\u201d\nAL: When you were developing the RDM-40, was there anyone you spoke with from the HiFi/DJ community that gave you feedback or advice?\nSS:We always traveled quite a bit even with the RDM20. When we released it, we traveled to Paris, we went to London, we went to Berlin, and we would place the mixer for one afternoon in a record store, invite some people so they could try it, they could listen to it, and give us honest feedback. During those travels, we gathered a lot of valuable information, and more than information, but the feeling, you know, like, \u201cOkay, well, what are people down for, what are they looking for? What are the actual needs?\u201d\nIt took us a long time to define the feature set of the new mixer \u2013 where do you draw the line? We still wanted to follow our puristic attitude, but at the same time the device should cover the important functions which are needed in the club context. I am very happy with the outcome, and I think the community is as well. Both private bedroom DJs and venues reacted very positively to the newborn RDM40. We were able to create a mixer without compromising the sound and build quality, and that\u2019s the most important thing for us.\nAL: So what were some of the biggest challenges that you faced with launching this whole business? What were some of the things that stood out about bringing Varia to market?\nSS:I think the most difficult part is to create a product with a top quality standard, which pays our bills on one side, but is affordable for the DJs out there. Neither are we willing to do any cuts on the quality, nor do we want a product in the luxury price segment which is only affordable to a few wealthy people.\nWe want our products flying out, serving DJs, vinyl diggers and music lovers all around the world \u2013 so it has to be affordable in a way. On the other hand, we\u2019re facing crazy costs of living in Switzerland. Having the whole production here doesn\u2019t help to save money, either. So, finding this balance is always tricky.\nAL: When you took me on that tour of the workshop, one of the things that really stood out was how collaborative the Varia team is\u2026 Everyone plays a role. It seems like community is probably a big part of the culture. Do you think that translates to your products in any way?\nSS:Well, certainly, it brings a lot of joy to ourselves. And, there\u2019s quite a big amount of passion in this project, and we just love having a good time, so how do you have a good time? You invite your friends to do things together, that\u2019s really what we try to do whenever we can. And honestly, I\u2019m also proud to say, \u201cHey, we were able to create something, which is mostly done locally, and sell this, and make a living out of it, while having such a good time!\u201d That\u2019s a really, really pleasing way of work. Of course, it\u2019s not the cheapest way of doing something. But again, it\u2019s always been more of a passion-driven thing than a business-driven thing. So I\u2019m really satisfied with that.\nAL: Would you say that is the defining philosophy and culture of Varia Instruments? To grow organically and to do everything with passion?\nSS:Yes. Our work is driven by our passion and love for music. It is always very closely connected and it brings us a lot of joy. We want to follow a way that leads us to places where we can find this joy and passion for music. Even the business side of Varia is just an accessory thing to keep it going, but it\u2019s really not what our hearts are beating for. Yes, we want to do everything in Switzerland, and we want to do everything properly, but the passion is always about the sound, the music, and the culture at large.\n\u201cWe never stop exploring. Marcel and I aren\u2019t the risky business types either. The way we went really suits us \u2013 better many small steps towards the right direction than thinking big and finding investors and doing weird things to expand profits.\u201d\nAL: It\u2019s funny because the passion-project angle of Varia Instruments makes a lot of sense to me. When I first saw the RDM20 and RDM40, it gave me this odd sense of nostalgia, like I had seen it somewhere before. The metal casing, the analog VU meter, the backlit green cue buttons, etc. And at first I thought it must have reminded me of the 1970's amplifiers like the Marantz, the old Sonys, Kenwoods. But I read through the Varia Instruments zine and in it you described this passion and love you have for space exploration and it hit me. Oh my god, this design looks like one of the old lunar modules! Am I crazy? Am I wrong on that?\nSS:Of course not! Absolutely! We created a \u201cspace mission\u201d to underline the launch of the RDM40 because it was a huge endeavor for us. We spent three years working on this project. Hundreds of hours of development. All of the electronics were developed from scratch. It was a massive undertaking.\nYou mentioned the lunar module: when we were initially building the prototype, I designed the stand of the mixer piece by piece. I also fabricated it by myself on an old milling machine. So, naturally I took a lot of inspiration from the Apollo 11 Mission \u2013\u00a0 and people loved it. It was so beautiful to see the response and to know, \u201cWow, I\u2019m not the only space guy out there.\u201d People really loved it.\nEven my girlfriend got involved in the project. She does some fashion design and actually has her studio here in our workshop. So I asked her to make patches like the ones Astronauts have on their spacesuits. She has an embroidering machine and did some magic tricks to bring my ideas to light. It was so much fun to do that with her! Jeff Mills even heard about it and asked us for an interview for his Escape Velocity magazine. How crazy is that? It should be the other way around!\nAL: You and Marcel traveled extensively when you were demoing the mixers... Japan, and Korea, cities in the USA like Detroit, New York City, Miami, and all over Europe. Were there any differences between the places you traveled that stand out in the club/listening room/HiFi context?\nSS:It\u2019s interesting. Since we are technicians, we view the clubbing scene from an entirely different perspective. For example, when we traveled to Berlin, we were invited to Berghain to check out their sound system and we went during the daytime when all of the lights were on. It\u2019s a totally different experience than what most people who go raving at a club get to see, and that\u2019s really cool for us because it provides a detailed look at how the clubs themselves are designed. What I\u2019ve seen is that there are venues all over the world that devote a tremendous amount of passion into the space and into the sound system. But these places are still pretty rare, after all.\nSome of the differences that really stand out are the sizes of the clubs themselves. I was impressed by many tiny clubs in Japan with amazing sound and intention. European and US clubs tend to be bigger and more focused on bringing in many people, from what I have seen.\nAL: Do you feel like the smaller, more intimate clubs are more likely to carry rotary mixers like the RDM20 or RDM40?\nSS:Yeah, I would say so. The smaller clubs tend to be more intentional and brought to life through passion. If you want to build a club to make money, you aren\u2019t going to build a small, 150 capacity room\u2026 You\u2019ll build a huge space with a 3000+ person capacity. So, yeah I would say that these smaller spaces would be more likely to carry our products since it aligns with this philosophy of doing things for the love of doing it, rather than just for money.\nAL: You mentioned being impressed by the sound and vibe of the smaller clubs you\u2019ve visited in Japan. I think most would agree that they\u2019re one of the main countries that has been a driving force on everything Hi-Fi-related since, well, basically from the beginning.\nSS:In my opinion, when the Japanese do something, they don\u2019t give only 80%. And, of course, this kind of attitude is perfect when it comes to sound, because a lot of perfection is needed there. So yes, there are amazing sound systems and a wealth of knowledge about everything Hi-Fi. It\u2019s really impressive.\nIt makes sense that the concept of the so-called listening bar was born in Japan. The idea is to have a place with an exceptional sound system where people could go, enjoy a drink and listen to albums and do nothing but that. And this idea was exported to the rest of the world in the past decade.\nI love that good sound systems are popping up everywhere, but it\u2019s somehow a tricky situation: When places in the western world try to replicate this concept, the mindset of the people is totally different. You don\u2019t go to a bar and stay silent for two hours and keep to yourself. You\u2019re there to be social, to meet your friends, to go on a date, whatever. And it\u2019s not really compatible with the original concept of the kissas/listening bars of Japan. Nonetheless, I\u2019m sure that this experience can be cultivated, and there are ways to satisfy the different wishes of the visitors. Why not do a \u2018silent listening event\u2019 on the more quiet nights in the beginning of the week, and then have a more easy going evening on weekends?\n\u201cI love that good sound systems are popping up everywhere, but it\u2019s somehow a tricky situation: When places in the western world try to replicate this concept, the mindset of the people is totally different.\u201d\nAL: It\u2019s funny that you mention that, because we have a Dedicated Listening event on Mondays and Wednesdays at In Sheep\u2019s Clothing NYC.\nSS:Well there you have it.\nAL: I want to pivot a bit and talk with you about DJing and discovering new music. I watched the mix you did for My Analog Journal recently and I\u2019m always interested in how DJs discover new music so I wanted to touch on that.\u00a0 How do you find new music? Are you on internet radio, music blogs, record stores, word of mouth\u2026\nSS:I always buy a lot of records when I\u2019m traveling. So if we have a test session in a record store, I like going through the crates discovering music that way. And here in the workshop we listen to mixes all day long from other DJs, radio shows, NTS, SoundCloud, Mixcloud, whatever. I really like finding music this way because of the work the DJ puts into recording a mix. Recording a 1 or 2 hour mix and coming up with a concept or theme. But a lot of times it\u2019s as simple as a friend saying, \u201cHey, do you know this record?\u201d\nAL: On the subject of record stores, there\u2019s this quote from J Rocc in a documentary that dublab made years ago. He talks about how the best way to get to know a city is to just go to the record stores and they\u2019ll point you in the right direction. And that always resonated with me because whether it\u2019s digging, or DJing, or clubbing, whatever, it\u2019s such a small, tight-knit community that I think really brings people in. It sounds kinda like that\u2019s what you guys did when you were shopping Varia Instruments around as well.\nSS:Yeah, I mean, to have a passion for something is great. But to share it with like-minded people, that\u2019s a really amazing thing. And it can be in a record store, it can be at 2 AM on the dancefloor, in a hardware store with another mechanic. Or at an art gallery during an exhibition, you know? Wherever.\nAL: It can even be through a DM on Instagram.\nSS:Exactly."

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/how-to-improve-the-sound-of-your-hi-fi-room-acoustics/",
        "content": "This is a topic that doesn\u2019t get enough attention. Aside from system building which we\u2019re trying to focus on in ourAudiophile System Builderseries of articles. Most people don\u2019t put any thought into the topic of room acoustics; and not until it\u2019s too late and they already unboxed their new system.\nBefore you buy any piece of audio equipment; but specifically, loudspeakers, remember thatyour room is the single most important component in your stereo.\nExhale.\nEven with something as simple as a pair ofSonos One SLwireless loudspeakers, you need to pay attention to setup and room acoustics.\nWe have listened to more than a few six-figure stereo systems that left us less unimpressed, so don\u2019t feel overly dismayed that your new $500 pair ofbookshelf loudspeakerssound broken fresh out of the box.\nExperience has taught us; and it\u2019s often a painful financial lesson, that even the best stereo systems in the world can fail to deliver the sonic experience you were expecting if set-up in the wrong room, or in a setting without proper acoustic treatment. Room acoustics affect even the best components.\nConcert venues, houses of worship, movie theaters, and recording studios utilize acoustic treatment to minimize or eliminate acoustic issues and while there are domestic issues to consider in the home setting; like your spouse hating a set of bass traps or absorption panels hanging out in your living room, the reality is that every room has acoustic issues and there are reasonable solutions to make your new pair of loudspeakers sound even better than they did in the store.\nHeavily carpeted rooms will often sound acoustically dead if combined with too much furniture. The key is to find a balance between lively and dead.\nEverything about your room matters; the shape, dimensions, surface materials, position of windows, and doorways. Sound waves interact differently with the room and the objects within it; the sound from your loudspeakers reflects off of different surfaces in your room before it ever reaches your ears. Before you buy anything, think about the type of loudspeaker you are considering and how it might interact with your room.\nIf you plan on using a typical living space like a den or living room, measure your room and determine how far back you will be sitting from the set-up location of your loudspeaker, and how far into the room you can set them up. If (like most of us) you have domestic considerations, it\u2019s unlikely that you will be able to position your new pair of loudspeakers 3-5\u2019 from the wall which might allow them to sound their best; more open, deeper and wider soundstage.\nModern homes often feature a lot of windows, and while that might offer a picturesque view of the world outside, it\u2019s often a recipe for disaster with a lot of loudspeakers as the reflective nature of glass can negatively affect spatial cues and make your system sound very bright. There are solutions to this which we will discuss.\nRoom shape and dimensions have a critical impact on bass response; bass waves require space to unfold but that doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t hear or feel bass information below a certain frequency in a small room if you make some acoustic changes.\nSound waves generated by your loudspeakers are either absorbed by objects or materials in the room, reflect off surfaces within your room, or pass through the room itself into an adjoining space. A rectangular room is often a better starting point than a perfectly square room.\nFloor surfaces can have a significant impact on the sound of your loudspeakers; stone, tile, and marble without any type of area rug can make your system more forward sounding or bright. Hardwood floors absorb sound more effectively, but they also require some form of area rug or carpeting to minimize reflections and low frequency information.\nHeavily carpeted rooms will often sound acoustically dead if combined with too much furniture. The key is to find a balance between lively and dead.\nThe first reflection points along the sidewalls can have an enormous impact on the imaging and overall clarity of the sound.\nProfessional acoustic products work as intended, but with few exceptions, they look pretty hideous in a domestic environment. Because our primary concerns are minimizing the first reflection points and improving the bass response of your loudspeakers within your existing space, there are a number of inexpensive and practical solutions that you can implement.\nThe wall surface behind your loudspeakers should never be too hard (bare walls) or too absorptive. A wall unit filled with a mixture of books, picture frames, and even records will minimize reflections (depending on the type of loudspeaker) and absorb bass if you have to place your loudspeaker up against the wall; in a scenario where your loudspeaker is really close to the wall, bass will wrap around the rear of the cabinet, reflect off the wall and arrive at your ears out of phase with the rest of the sound.\nMusic will always sound like it\u2019s coming from the wall devoid of any soundstage depth or width.\nThe first reflection points along the sidewalls can have an enormous impact on the imaging and overall clarity of the sound. It\u2019s somewhat surreal how treating these two points can make everything sound more three-dimensional and focused. You will require an assistant for this but it\u2019s a quick fix.\nSit in your normal listening position and have your friend walk with a small mirror along the surface of the wall until you see the loudspeaker\u2019s (starting at the loudspeaker itself) reflection.\nMark this with a pencil on both walls. In a professional setting, acoustic panels of varying thickness are used to absorb frequency information. In a domestic setting, consider using bookshelves, wall hangings, or even art work (without glass) at these points.\nFurniture can be used effectively to minimize reflections and absorb excessive bass; a large sofa or wood coffee table can be very effective. Glass tables should be avoided as they will exacerbate the problems we are trying to fix.\nCarpeting or area rugs can be a huge source of improvement because they will reduce room noise, impact reverberation, and absorb reflections. If possible, stick with natural fibers like wool which have better absorptive qualities.\nRoom acoustics is not a very exciting topic but if you fix 2-3 of these issues, the sonic rewards can be substantial. You don\u2019t have to spend a lot of money either. Use what you have already and get that tape measure and mirror ready.\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission."

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/vox-discotape/",
        "content": "Contrary to popular belief that the discotheque and dance revolution didn\u2019t begin until the mid-\u201970s, the whole two-turntables-and-a-mixer thing started happening a half-decade earlier. Demand was such that audio companies started brainstorming ways to capitalize.\nThe May 1973 issue of the unsung British magazineBeat Instrumental, for example, devoted 10-pages to a special section called \u201cDiscotheque Equipment Supplement: A Guide to Sounds Around and Things to Come.\u201d Noting the rise of dance clubs and DJs, one British gear maker in the story accurately explained the phenomenon like this: \u201cA lot of people who have not taken time off to learn an instrument can buy a unit, play places and be \u2018somebody.'\u201d He called the trend \u201cthe most commercial music thing ever and the future is limitless.\u201d\nAttempting to understand the trend,Beat Instrumentaloffered this funny, and true, suggestion: \u201cReasons for the discos\u2019 appeal range from the fact that people like to dance together to a symptom of life\u2019s impermanence and the swing to instant stimuli.\u201d\nThe section offered the rationale for its existence in the introduction, referencing a famed DJ for pirate radio station Radio Caroline: \u201cDiscotheques, whether Emperor Rosko leading his army through England\u2019s hills and dales or a bloke down the road taking his gramophone to the village hall, have been rocketing in popularity ever since they were realised as an alternative to second-rate groups and juke boxes.\n\u201cWith this growth in popularity has come a widening of the market in disco equipment, which now includes voice/record faders, sound and light synchronisers, deck monitor systems and even jingle and effect cassette units.\u201d\nThe Vox Discotheque (Vox Discotape in the US) is one of the most covetable of the era. Made from the same Vox shell that housed their iconic Continental Organ and featuring a sturdy chrome stand, the Discotheque featured two Garrard SP25s, Shure cartridges, a cassette recorder to capture your sets and a built-in 50-watt Vox amp. Add in sliding volume controls, cassette and microphone controllers and \u2014 get this \u2014 \u201crecord scratch and rumble filters.\u201d\nVox officially introduced the Discotape in 1971.

        "title": "Berkeley/Arden: Classic Home Speakers Featuring Tannoy\u2019s Iconic Dual Concentric Driver System",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/tannoy-berkeley-arden/",
        "content": "Founded in London by Guy R. Fountain, Tannoy first gained widespread recognition in the early \u201930s with their public-address speaker systems that would be used for famous sporting and state events, as well as for the Ministry of Defense during wartime. By the \u201940s, Tannoy systems were so widely used that the term \u201ctannoy\u201d came to be used in British English for any public-address system. In 1947, the company made their second great innovation with the Dual Concentric driver, which placed the tweeter behind the centre of the medium or bass driver. This revolutionary technology would come to define Tannoy and the later audio industry with Tannoy monitors being widely used in countless studios around the world including Abbey Road, Air and Decca.\nOne of their most iconic home speaker designs, the Berkeley/Arden was released in 1976 and is a substantial sized two-way loudspeaker system that provided the high power handling capacity and sensitivity of their famous studio monitors in a more compact enclosure. The Tannoy HPD Integrated Drive system consists of a direct radiator bass unit and a high-frequency horn-loaded compression driver both located within the same frame and magnet assembly, which is why it is known as the dual concentric system.\n\u201cThe Berkley\u2019s just sounded, well, like the music was supposed to sound, like you were there. Actually most recording studio\u2019s mastered their recordings using either Tannoys or JBLs.\u201d\nThe speakers are also beloved for their cabinet design which features a dual ducted port that provides remarkable bass response for the enclosure size, and a front recess mounted loudspeaker to ensure smooth extended treble.\u00a0In this ducted 2-way system, the low frequency radiator is 15 inches (381 mm) in diameter and carries the frequency range from 35 Hz to the crossover at 1 kHz. The coaxially mounted 2 inch (51 mm) compression driver then takes over from 1 kHz upward.\nThe Berkley/Arden is a substantial size, but tastefully accented so that it does not overwhelm a normal living room. The enclosure is finished in oiled walnut with two removable brown cloth covered grilles. The upper and larger grille covers the loudspeaker cone and, while removable, need not be removed by the user. The lower grille covers two switched equalizer controls. These controls are intended to allow for minor higher frequency adjustments which a user might set to suit his particular tastes in music reproduction.\nThe Tannoy Berkeley originally sold for $480 in 1976. Unfortunately, the Berkeleys and Ardens can be a bit difficult to find outside of the UK even on used hi-fi boards and auction sites. A pair of Berkeleys will typically go for around $3,000, while Ardens can cost upwards to $10k depending on condition. They can also be expensive to repair as Tannoy is no longer in business.\n\u201cLow level listening is INCREDIBLE. The Tannoy sound amazing at very low SPL, the bass is still very present, the dynamics seem intact, harmonics untouched. WOW. There\u2019s a palpability to the music at low level that is truly wonderful and suits my needs a lot. This is something I did not expect and very happy to realize and truly quite a few leagues better in that department than the Harbeth, Amphion, and KEF LS50 we have.\u201d\n\u201cThey seem to have a depth of sound, a scale that I have not had before from any of the previous speakers that I have ever owned, and I can now see why some people are quite so passionate about them.\u201d\n\u201cForget technicalities, the Tannoy sounds slightly coloured compared to the Harbeth SHL5+. But it seems that with Tannoy, I very easily forget any flaws or coloration and really fall in the music. It\u2019s even hard comparing SHL5+ with Tannoy because it\u2019s such a different sound. There\u2019s a presence and an immediacy in the mids with the Tannoy that makes instruments and vocals sound more realistic, more weighty (of course since its a 15 inch), perhaps less detailed but more grounded in the intention of what the musician is playing. The image is immense; its a very big sound that engulf you. the Harbeth are laid back in comparison but in reality it\u2019s more like its the Tannoy that may be slightly forward in nature or perhaps simply Horn vs Tweeter? The bass is absolutely coherent with the midrange. It doesn\u2019t seem to be slower than the mids at all, and I\u2019m relieved about that. They can play LOUD!!!!!!!\u201d\n\u201cI bought a pair of Berkleys new in \u201977. I had listened to every high end speaker I could find. The Berkley\u2019s just sounded, well, like the music was supposed to sound, like you were there. Actually most recording studio\u2019s mastered their recordings using either Tannoys or JBLs.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent transient response and top end purity are only two of the attributes that make Tannoy loudspeakers so special. When you add in their high resolution midrange and coherency \u2014 you have the basis for a very fine loudspeaker.\u201d"

        "content": "Hi-fi culture in the United States has long been an obsession of mature audiences with deep pockets and acquired tastes, but the massive interest in hi-fi analog systems over the past few years by younger audiences has undeniably brought new life into the industry. Both millennials and Gen Z are known for their effective knack of \u201cdisrupting\u201d social as much as consumer norms, so it\u2019s no surprise that sooner or later that way of thinking would change the way we listen to music.\nWestern Acoustics out of San Francisco\u2019s Dogpatch district are racing to lead the way and growing so quickly they\u2019re currently actively recruiting to grow their team. I sat down with the founder ofWestern Acoustics, Liam Porr, to talk about how he chose to set off on this audacious journey, and learn about how he designed and engineered a listening system that effortlessly nests into the lives of listeners.\nTana Yonas: Have you always sought out superior sound, or was exploring HiFi something that you got into later in your life? How has your relationship to sound evolved?\nLiam Porr:I think that for me, when I really started getting into audio, it was partially because I love music and I listen to a lot of it.\u00a0 But It\u2019s hard to know what you\u2019re missing out on until you listen to high-quality audio. I also had exposure to people talking about hi-fi systems.\nMy dad was really into Klipsch speakers. He grew up nearby Hope, Arkansas, where Klipsch is still headquartered and does all their manufacturing still, so he was always a big Klipsch guy. He\u2019d always talk about the Klipsch La Scalas that he had in college that he really loved, and he thought they were the coolest thing ever. I also found out recently that Paul Klipsch\u2019s wife, Valerie, used to teach my grandmother piano lessons, coincidentally.\nAt some point, I started asking myself, what\u2019s the deal with this? I was just too curious not to try and explore what all these people were talking about. And I was really interested in the technology behind them, because of some of the electrical engineering courses I was taking in college.\nTY: What was your first experience with hi-fi, then?\nLP: Eventually, I got my hands on a pair of La Scalas that were in disrepair. I really wanted to fix them up and learn how they worked. And the eventual goal was to be able to experience the high-fidelity audio that people always talked about. I looked at it as like an interesting journey working with my hands and trying to see what\u2019s possible and discover what people have been talking about. So, it was less about being dissatisfied with what I had already listened to.\nTY: How did you think about the spaces you are designing for?\nLP: For Western Acoustics, my head was around realistic living environments. I\u2019m a young guy; I live in a regular apartment with a small living room. And I want to be able to have a music system that integrates well into a room that has a lot of other different purposes. When I went over to this guy\u2019s house to buy from him.\nWhen I bought the La Scalas that I ended up repairing, I had gotten them from an older dude, and they were from his second home. He had this whole separate room for listening, it was literally just the La Scalas, a turntable and his record collection. I was super confused. I didn\u2019t understand listening rooms as a concept. Having a space where you sit down and listen to records every day and dedicate a whole room to it was very foreign to me at the time.\nNow I love that concept. I\u2019ve since learned a lot more about that kind of philosophy towards music listening. But for me personally, I don\u2019t have a room to dedicate to that. Realistically, most other people don\u2019t either.\nTY: A lot of people rely on Spotify and other digital music services in order to stream music. Oftentimes, it doesn't give listeners the quality of other mediums because of how most streaming platforms compress files. Does it make your job harder?\nLP: It definitely makes you rethink things sort of, but compromises are inevitable. In a perfect world, everybody would be listening to either vinyl records or lossless digital files, but this is not how people like to listen to music these days. Even for me, I\u2019ll make playlists on Spotify and get locked into those kinds of platforms.\nHi-fi allows me to listen to music a little bit differently. But sometimes I just want to play my playlist that I have on there, and I don\u2019t want to have to sit down and swap out records for every song. That wouldn\u2019t make sense.\nI want to allow for the fact I\u2019m moving around my apartment, like when I\u2019m cooking in the kitchen and stuff like that. I can sacrifice a bit of the bit rate for the convenience of being able to utilize these platforms in the same way I use them to listen to music on my headphones on the go.\nTo answer your question, it\u2019s not necessarily challenging, but it\u2019s just something to keep in mind to design around.\u00a0 I\u2019m not a purist. I like to think about the best way to integrate music into my life, and not making sure I have the perfect setup for every time I listen to music on my system.\n\u201cI definitely designed this product with that kind of person in mind, somebody who cares about both the beauty/lifestyle convenience side of things, and the engineering, the specs, and on\u2026\u201d\nTY: It\u2019s interesting that you're in the Bay Area famous for being at the center of new technology and culture. How has that played a part in developing your vision for Western Acoustics?\nLP: I\u2019ve worked in tech, and I was a part of that side of the culture here. I do take some of that attitude towards the way that I think about my company, both in terms of the entrepreneurship side of it, and then also just like the way that I think about products that we\u2019re going to produce. The prevailing attitude of people here is very focused on science and engineering and because of that, people are a lot more critical of the quality of the components that you\u2019re using, the specifications, measurements, and stuff like that are things that really matter to people. These are smart people, and so it\u2019s really hard to hide behind marketing. You have to have something that\u2019s really good on paper, and in person. On top of that, there\u2019s a lot of people here who want to have something that\u2019s beautiful as well as being high quality.\nI definitely designed this product with that kind of person in mind, somebody who cares about both the beauty/lifestyle convenience side of things, and the engineering, the specs, and on in addition to all these things; they have an engineer\u2019s mindset to audio.\nTY:\u00a0 Were you developing this product during the pandemic, when it was really hard to get components because of the global supply chain failures? Are you able to get the components that you want and trust that you'll be able to get them next year from now, for instance?\nLP: It\u2019s not easy, but there are some domestic suppliers that are really good. Madisound is a great one. They\u2019re the classic, you know, Parts Express is one everybody knows, but they\u2019re not known as much for supplying the highest quality components. They have a lot of great stuff, all basic things that you would need.\nBut if you\u2019re looking for really high quality hi-fi transducers, and things like that, you would go to a company like Madisound. For small quantities of stuff, they have most of what you would need, so thankfully I haven\u2019t had too many issues in the process of R&D.\nBut when it comes to actual production runs, which we\u2019ve only just started, we didn\u2019t have to deal with much of the issues everyone had during the pandemic. There\u2019s still remnants that we have to deal with. We get our woofers from a company in Denmark, and they have a long lead time because of the materials that they have to gather and because of the supply chain chokes that are still in effect.\nIt can be difficult; we have a long lead time for things. But so far, we haven\u2019t had some of the disastrous supply chain issues you hear about. We just have to plan ahead.\nYY: What products do you have available now?\nLP: We have two speaker options right now, the Type 2 speaker and the Type 1.\nThe Type 2 speaker is the one that\u2019s a bit more accessible. It\u2019s a small bookshelf size speaker that\u2019s about 16.5\u201d tall by 10.5\u201d wide. It\u2019s meant to be more like a relatively near-field listening speaker system that works well really in smaller rooms and ultimately sounds good in the home in general.\nThen we have the Type 1 system which is a much larger format speaker system, but it\u2019s still meant to not be too intrusive in the home. It doesn\u2019t have a very striking aesthetic to it. It\u2019s meant to be a bit more subtle, laid back, almost like a pair of cabinets that you have in your home. The Type 1 in particular is meant to be the flagship hi-fi system. It utilizes Japanese woofers, and it tries to get deep bass without sacrificing on transients. The woofers from Fostex in Japan are meant to produce a deep bass response into the 30 hertz range while still having a very, very sharp, fast response. You can play music like jazz or things along those lines without muddying up the sound.\nTY: And as far as designers or design movements that have inspired the kind of look of your speakers, who and what has inspired you?\nLP: I think the classic one that people tend to mention and I feel similarity about is the work of Dieter Rams. I love the work that he does and I\u2019m very inspired by him. I wouldn\u2019t say it totally encapsulates what we do, but I do really take a lot of appreciation for not over designing. It\u2019s important to ask the amount that you need to have a part of an object, you know? What are the essential components?\nI also really enjoy the international typographic style. I like that approach to graphic design, and the emphasis on readability and legibility. And their inspiration from the Bauhaus movement and just how different that was at the time from everything else. I like to ask, how can we reduce the design of something to the things that matter the most? And then how to visualize those things to people. Those are the things that I kind of think about when I think about my speakers.\nFor form and shape, I really love Brancusi and his sculptural work. I just think it\u2019s what he makes is beautiful, and I love his reduction of things to their essential forms. Using only a few different kinds of shapes, and then using those in combination with each other to make very different effects while still retaining simplicity. You can see a similarity to that in our type 2 speaker with the rounded horn on a very square baffle and shape. So I\u2019m very inspired by his work as well.\nI\u2019m obviously very inspired by Devon Turnbull and Ojas audio gear, mostly in terms of just how he reconceptualized what hi-fi can be to somebody in their life and what a hi-fi system can do. When you take it to the extreme like he has, it can be like a personal odyssey, and defining your own temple, which I think is not only fascinating but it\u2019s also very unique. I\u2019ve never seen anybody do it like that, and he\u2019s sort of defining his own category in terms of what speakers can look like.\nTY: I also really appreciate how wood is a very present material in your pieces as well, and the woodworking is really beautiful. Was that something that was important to have a natural form in the design?\nLP: Yeah, the inclusion of wood is a really important part of our audio system, and I think that the inspiration for that is using humble materials. Materials that are very accessible for people that aren\u2019t too out there. With some of the really high-end audio, I think you could get your Wilson speaker color matched with a Rolls Royce. I mean there\u2019s a certain person that appeals to. And Wilsons are the top of the line, they have incredible technology\u2026 but I think that your speakers don\u2019t have to have an auto body finish, and in most homes they shouldn\u2019t.\u00a0 I think that the natural tone of wood, and just that sort of feeling that it evokes, makes it feel more approachable in my mind, and I think I want to even take it further. Right now we use CNC machines, and classical cabinetry techniques to assemble these speakers, but I want to even potentially lean more into wood craftsmanship, and make things feel a little bit more like they were touched by a human\u2019s hand.\n\u201cI love vintage speakers, but I think that a lot of them don\u2019t really fit in a modern home with more avant-garde interior design. I felt like there was room for something different.\u201d\nTY: That reminds me of just the overall kind of collective nostalgia that's really made analog culture popular. Why do you think it's become such an important part of popular culture these days, especially since the pandemic?\nLP: Analog systems are really interesting and unique, and I really appreciate the romance of an analog system. I think that during the pandemic, I was in the same boat. Analog systems have so much culture and history and story behind them. Especially when we were really starved of that human connection. During the pandemic, suddenly you can build a different kind of relationship to the music you\u2019ve loved all your life by integrating it into a system the music was designed to be listened to. I think that sort of thing is very unique, and it just forms a stronger bond and meaning for the music that you listen to when you do it on an analog system like that. Obviously, I think there\u2019s a lot of ways that we can develop beyond old school analog, but I still think that a lot of the technology that we developed back then is still the best, and there\u2019s no reason to change it if it\u2019s not, you know, broken.\nTY: Your products obviously have a lot of integrity. When you were building the company\u2019s products and the overall brand, did you have an exact idea of what you wanted to build from day one or did it evolve during time? What were the priorities for Western Acoustics?\nLP: When I first started out I would not have been able to articulate it in the way that I\u2019m able to talk to you about it right now for sure. I was just going off of my feelings of what I felt like an audio system should be, so it was all very emotionally and intuitively driven.\nI love vintage speakers, but I think that a lot of them don\u2019t really fit in a modern home with more avant-garde interior design. I felt like there was room for something different. In addition to that, we have this different approach to listening to music in our daily lives. We\u2019ve seen how the convenience of listening to music on our phones and headphones is just becoming more and more integrated and more easy to use. I feel like speaker systems and hi-fi systems specifically haven\u2019t evolved to the same level of convenience, and I think that could use some reinterpretation. In a lot of ways, I was just designing a speaker system for myself when I did this, and I wanted to have a speaker system that fit into my home while also sounding beautiful and also being easy to use. Beauty and convenience that\u2019s weighed just as highly as the audio quality\nTY: Is your perspective being received well from others in the HiFi speaker industry at places like trade shows?\nLP: The people who have been the most vocal about us have been people in the design world, certainly. I\u2019ve been talking with a lot of interior design studios and even architects that have been very interested in the work that we\u2019re doing at Western Acoustics.\nI feel like the audio world just needs more time to form an opinion about a particular company, and we\u2019re very young. We only launched our first product in November, and so that side of it will take a lot of time. Obviously, with the design aspect, it\u2019s a lot easier to spread the visual pictures of the thing than it is to get more people to sit down and listen to them. So I think that\u2019s part of why we received so much feedback from the design world first.\nTY: Is there a genre of music that sounds best on your speakers? Or did you kind of optimize them for a certain sound?\nLP: You know, in a lot of ways I look at this as another step after vintage audio, in terms of the culture around music. The current world of hi-fi has been very centered around expensive, sometimes difficult-to-use products. The vintage audio world has a lot more unique culture around it. I\u2019m looking at this speaker system as an iteration upon that scene, so I thought about the ways that we can improve upon vintage audio without losing the soul of vintage audio. I felt like one of the main trade-offs of a vintage system typically is there\u2019s a lot of lack in bass response.\nThat\u2019s just simply because, music back in the \u201870s, \u201880s and early \u201890s didn\u2019t have as much of an emphasis on low-end bass like modern music does. That\u2019s just a reprioritization of the kinds of music that people are listening to these days, so I did try to make sure that the speaker systems that we developed had a very strong bass response.\nElectronic music can have the kind of complexity and beauty of something like jazz or classical music while still having a sound signature that is reminiscent of modern rap, R&B, hip-hop \u2013 that sort of thing sounds great. There\u2019s room-filling bass on the low-end for a lot of these kinds of tracks, especially in some of these ambient tracks that play some bass notes for a long period. It\u2019ll just fill your room with like this 35, 40 hertz wave. I really love the way that that feels, so I listen to a lot of music like that.\nTY: Are there favorite records that you like to play on your system?\nLP: There\u2019s a handful of records that I go to a lot. I listen to a lot of cool jazz, especially Bill Evans\u2019 Trio. Their recordWaltz for Debbyis one of my favorite jazz albums in the world and any of the stuff that they recorded at the Village Vanguard is honestly just fantastic. It fills the room with sound, especially with the Type 1\u2019s. It really feels like it\u2019s being played live right there in front of you.\nOn the more electronica side, I really likeSakuraby Susumu Yokota. That\u2019s a slightly more ambient electronic album and it\u2019s very beautiful. I like to listen to that one a lot, and another one similar to that, recommended by Devon Turnbull, calledSpace 1.8by Nala Sinephro. That album is also really, really beautiful. That one particularly shows how you can play really complex, transient music while having a deep, filling bass response.\nOn the other end in electronica, there\u2019s this album calledEverydayby Tourist, a British musician. Again, I think he\u2019s on the same level asSakura, but a little bit more dancey, I guess, in its taste. Then there\u2019sBeautyby Ryuichi Sakamoto. That one has a little bit more groove and I like the deepness of that music.\nTY: What's next for you? Do you have your eyes on the next frontier?\nLP: Yeah, we\u2019re going to keep building speakers, for sure. I\u2019m looking to build something that\u2019s a bit more accessible in the price range for people. That\u2019s something I\u2019m trying to work on developing this year, since the price point\u2019s pretty high still for the speakers. That\u2019s just the reality of building something high-quality in small batches.\nIn addition to that, my eyes are set on room treatment. I\u2019m working on room treatment stuff because I really think that, when we talk about engineering a sound system to sound as good as it possibly can, there\u2019s a lot of gains left on the table with room treatment.\nNobody touches it, and nobody understands it. I think there\u2019s a lot of room for improvement with the way that typical hi-fi home systems are set up.\nWestern Acoustics currently manufactures two different models from their space in SF, and you can follow themon Instagramto stay updated about their activities and new products."

        "title": "Looking to Upgrade Your Sound? Here are 10 Vintage Amplifiers of Note",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/10-vintage-amplifiers/",
        "content": "Here\u2019s a scenario that virtually anyone who has entered the home listening game by investing in a vintage power amp or receiver has likely confronted. You\u2019re aware of the brands \u2014 Sansui, McIntosh, Marantz, Pioneer, Harman Kardon \u2014 but you don\u2019t know where to start and you don\u2019t want to mess up by buying something too old, battered or temperamental.\nWe hear you. Unless you\u2019re lucky enough to be the offspring of a noted gearhead like Jimmy Carter, who taught his kids to listen to music through a McIntosh amp and high-end speakers, we all enter audiophilia and intentional listening as novices looking for answers.\nThe good news is that the internet exists, and so do very smart people who know how stuff works. Whole forums are devoted to which companies\u2019 components still hum like Cadillacs and which turned out to be Saturns. For instance, we asked a populous vintage gear Facebook group this question: \u201cWe\u2019re compiling a list of 10 great vintage solid state amps for $600 or so (or less). What models need to be on the list to avoid embarrassing ourselves?\u201d The volume and variety of responses were overwhelming: commenters recommended both receivers and integrated amps, resulting in a drool-worthy bunch of potential purchases. (We upped the price cap a little bit to reflect reality.)\nBelow: Ten killer amps that will boost your eardrum intake without denting your wallet too much.\nLike the amplifiers listed below, prices keep going up on vintage gear. Built to last and, more important, to be repaired, pre-1990 audio gear remains in demand because the best of it will last a lifetime. The Fisher 500c, for example, celebrates its 60th anniversary this year. Founded by Avery Fisher, the American company released the 500c among a line of tube-powered receivers, and it sold hundreds of thousands of them. Prices are rising for this beautiful model. Recent eBay info says they\u2019re going for about $1200 right now.\nOne of the best-selling brands of the 1970s, Marantz\u2019s receivers remain easy to find, for now. The 2270, which will run you about $1,000 delivers what the company described in ads as \u201ca walloping 140 watts\u201d per channel. If that\u2019s above your budget, try the 2230, which runs about $700. If you don\u2019t care about an AM/FM receiver, we\u2019d recommend the Marantz 1060 integrated amp, which one commenter called \u201cthe most tube-like integrated amp I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d\n\u201cThe NAD 3020 Is a no-frills, moderately priced amplifier designed to provide state of the art performance and volume levels far in excess of what would be expected from its conservative 20 W per channel power rating,\u201d reads the ad copy for the NAD 3020. A perennial favorite, it was a huge seller for NAD. As such, there are a lot of 3020s around. For a deeper dive on this amp, check outEric Pye\u2018s article\u201cThe NAD 3020 and My Quest for the Holy Grail: Exit to Vintage Street\u201dforecoustics.\nThe original Stereo Review rave from 1970 described the Sansui 4000 as a receiver that \u201cstands with a small, select group of receivers with sufficient power to do justice to almost any speaker system at higher-than-normal listening levels. The Sansui 4000 would rate as an excellent receiver at almost any price. Selling as it does for $379.95, it is clearly an outstanding value.\u201d Indeed, this classic has doubled in price since then on the used market.\nIntroduced in 1979, the TA-F7B puts out 100 watts-per-channel and looks great while doing so. A dedicated built-in phono preamp ensured that the sound coming from the cartridge received ample signal power, and seems to cannon out of the system with force. This model is harder to come by, but worth the search. Sony amplifiers, in fact, consistently punch above their weight.\nA company that earned a reputation for, in its words, \u201cproducing state-of-the-art power amplifiers at rock-bottom prices,\u201d Hafler offered its models as both kits and finished products.\u00a0This beast of an amp is a lesser-known gem, as are the other models in the company\u2019s DH series, including the 220 and 500.\nFounded by hi-fi legend Robert Carver outside of Seattle, Phase Linear started in the basement of a grocery store in 1971 but within a few years was blowing away audiophiles around the world. A massive amp, it\u2019s another easily found, immediately rewarding purchase.\nSeriously. Trust us on this one: The Harmon Kardon 730 receiver is not only a beautiful thing, but it offers a warmth of tone that will transform the sound of any record for the better. In advertisements, the company characterizes its product as \u201cbeyond specifications,\u201d which is true.\nYou may remember this amp from thesecond edition of our room recordings. The Eico Hf-81 was first introduced in 1959 and is a low powered 14W amplifier that pairs well with efficient speakers (they sound great with our vintage Klipsch Cornwalls). It\u2019s a bit harder to find than the rest of these on the list and may take a bit of work to tune and maintain, but once properly set up, this unassuming amp will beat out most anything you\u2019ll find in its $800 \u2013 $1,000 price range. There\u2019s been a growing cult following around this one so grab it if you can find one at a good price!\nWith an elegant, minimalist design and 60 watts per channel power, the Japanese-made Yamaha CA-1000 was introduced in the early 1970s, when competitors including Pioneer, Sansui and Sony were changing the game on an annual basis. A glorious tank with precise volume, tone and filtering controls, this best-selling receiver is in plentiful supply on the secondhand market, and currently go for about $600."

        "content": "Next year will mark the Sony PlayStation\u2019s 30th anniversary, and as time passes the technology that helped define contemporary gaming is rendered more and more obsolete. Other than retro-focused gamers or collectors, the PS1 nobly served its purpose \u2014 to the tune of 100 million consoles sold \u2014 and as Sony introduced the PS2 and successive models, those first consoles ended up in the basement to be unloaded at future garage sales.\nLike DVDs, BluRays and CDs, you needed a buy a copy of the game to play the PS1, which you then placed into the console tray. Sony invested a lot of money into the PS1, and that included ensuring that the sound of gameplay was excellent. Bonus: The console read and played compact discs and came with RCA jacks, which meant that when you weren\u2019t playing Crash Bandicoot, you could plug it into the stereo\u2019s auxiliary input and blast GZA\u2019sLiquid Swordsat full volume.\nYou know where this is going: 30 years later with enthusiasm for used CDs rising \u2014 along with prices for quality CD players \u2014 the PS1\u2019s secret-weapon audio output, which was as good, if not better, than many CD players of the time, is driving budget sound freaks toward the console. The Sony-built digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and audio circuitry are well-regarded by gearheads for producing clear and detailed sound. Onesound dudewho knows his stuff and put the player to the test called the quality of the PS1 \u201cthe most analog sounding\u201d player he\u2019s heard, describing the sonics as \u201csmoother.\u201d\nBecause a working PS1 can be found on Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist and secondhand shops at a relatively low price (if you pay more than $75, keep looking) compared to dedicated audiophile CD players, the console makes it an obvious choice for those looking to enter the world of CD players and used CDs. Supply and demand dictates that those 100 million PS1s hanging around will keep prices low for the foreseeable future.\nThat means parts will remain plentiful, and that the mod/makers scene can playfully reinvent PS1s without having to invest too much up front."

The Pro-Ject Debut PRO may not be the most expensive turntable in its arsenal \u2014 but it\u2019s certainly the most important.\nPro-Ject sells the most audiophile turntables in the world and the list of OEM turntables that it produces for other manufacturers is quite extensive. If you notice certain similarities between Pro-Ject\u2019s Debut lineup and other manufacturers who are focused on the market below $1,000, you don\u2019t need to have your eyesight checked.\nPro-Ject has the distinct advantage of making most of their components in-house and the R&D resources to develop better sounding turntables for less money. When you run a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility, you can experiment with different materials and setups and get the final product to market much quicker; even with the current supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic.\nNobody has their manufacturing capabilities or ability to create high-end parts and tonearms at levels that would bury most companies.\nRega probably comes the closest, but their focus has also turned like Pro-Ject on other product categories where they can complete the circle and offer the consumer a one-stop shopping experience.\nPro-Ject is also part of theMcIntosh Grouphere in America where it can be packaged with Rotel, Sumiko, Sonus faber, and McIntosh products through a vast dealer network that only enhances its appeal.\nThe Pro-Ject Debut PRO is the natural competitor to the Rega Planar 3; one of the most popular and best-selling audiophile turntables of the past 30 years and having spent considerable time with both \u2014 it\u2019s starting to look like a very different race.\nBoth turntables are the best options at $1,000 and you really can\u2019t go wrong purchasing either one. The Rega sounds slightly quicker; agile might be a better way of describing it \u2014 but that\u2019s where the race ends for me.\nThe Debut PRO is better at everything else; we\u2019ll get to that later on.\nOne of the greatest failings of the Hi-Fi press over the past few decades has been our inability or even reluctance to provide proper context for consumers.\nHow a product behaves or interacts with other components within a similar price range and how you might build a system around it. I\u2019ve been quite focused on that for the past few years with our\u201cAudiophile System Builder\u201d columnand it should not come as a shock that I think the Pro-Ject Debut PRO belongs in a myriad of systems between $3,000 to $10,000 \u2014 its performance is that good if you can stretch that far at the top end.\nListening to Miles Davis, Donald Byrd, and Dexter Gordon, I was struck by the presence of musicians within the soundstage, the low end impact with every single loudspeaker at my disposal, and the overall uptick in resolution.\nThere are some similarities between the Pro-Ject Debut EVO and the PRO but the differences that make the Debut PRO $500 more are not small and there is a wide gap in their sonic performance.\nNot Grand Canyon wide \u2014 more like Evil Knievel Snake River wide.\nThe Pro-Ject Debut PRO Turntable extends the tradition of the Debut collection with a new striking design, featuring a satin black and brushed-nickel color scheme that really makes the table stand out. Pro-Ject is not offering different color options for the Debut PRO so those looking for a Ferrari yellow finish or forest green are out of luck.\nIn a departure from the other turntables in the lineup, the new Debut Pro features an all new 8.6\u201d tonearm that features a one-piece carbon fiber wrapped aluminum arm tube for excellent rigidity and reduction of resonance.\nOne of my biggest complaints about older Pro-Ject Debut turntables was the construction quality of the arm and how it felt during operation; I suffer from a slight tremor after a serious medical event in 2009 and I was always nervous operating them due to the weight and how loose it always felt in my hand.\nA heavy-duty, nickel-plated machined aluminum bearing block ensures the tight tolerance tonearm bearings move freely, allowing the tonearm to track precisely across the entire surface of the record.\nThe new arm feels far more rigid and I did not suffer the same level of anxiety in daily operation. I do prefer the head shell hook of the Rega tonearms which are easier for my large fingers to use but Pro-Ject has designed a much better tonearm for the Debut PRO that worked flawlessly.\nThe Debut PRO also features a die-cast aluminum platter with integrated TPE damping that is a much higher grade platter than what Pro-Ject has offered in the past.\nI\u2019m a bigger fan of die-cast aluminum platters than glass ones and I think Pro-Ject has a superior product than Rega in that regard; the sound has greater density to it and I found that once I substituted a cork platter mat for the supplied felt one, music had greater presence overall and the bass impact was much firmer with all genres of music.\nIn another new change, the tonearm height and azimuth are now both adjustable, allowing for the use of a wider range of cartridges. TheSumiko Rainier phono cartridgeis included with the Debut PRO and is pre-mounted and precision-aligned at the factory.\nHeight adjustable leveling feet with integrated resonance damping, electronic speed selection, a detachable acrylic dust cover and a premium semi-symmetrical phono cable (Connect It E) round out the Debut PRO\u2019s robust feature set. Pro-Ject has also included the tools for proper alignment and setting the tracking force.\nThe Debut PRO with the Rainier spent most of the review process connected to the McIntosh MP100 Phono Preamplifier, Croft RIAA Phono, and theCyrus Audio i9-XR Integrated Amplifier. I also ran the table directly into theNAD C 316BEE V2andRotel A12MKII Integrated Amplifiers.\nI also swapped out the Rainier for theGoldring E3andOrtofon 2M Blueto see how the table reacted to very different sounding cartridges; I wasn\u2019t surprised that the performance improved with better cartridges and the tonearm is a very solid platform for experimentation.\nAnIsoAcoustics ZaZen II Isolation platformwas used underneath the turntable in every scenario.\nThe Debut PRO hits rather hard with bass-heavy music and if your system can deliver it \u2014 you will experience it.\nMy expectations for a $500 turntable are very different in comparison to a $1,000 turntable, and I really expected the Debut PRO to deliver much better sound quality than my U-Turn Orbit+, NAD C 588, and Rega Planar 2 tables when used with the same electronics and loudspeakers.\nListening to Miles Davis, Donald Byrd, and Dexter Gordon, I was struck by the presence of musicians within the soundstage, the low end impact with every single loudspeaker at my disposal, and the overall uptick in resolution.\nCompared to theRega Planar 3, the Debut Pro is a much richer sounding deck with slightly less energy from a pace perspective. Rega puts a lot more emphasis on timing and pace, but also at the expense of midrange warmth and low end impact.\nHorns have slightly more bite with the Planar 3, but the Debut PRO delivers those same instruments with greater color and depth. Both the McIntosh and Croft phono preamps really breathed some light into each recording and the Debut Pro benefitted from the extra top end extension and energy.\nSome will interpret that as \u201cdull\u201d sounding, but the Debut PRO is anything but. With the more open sounding Goldring and Ortofon cartridges, the table delivered the same level of resolution and clarity of my custom Thorens tables restored by Vinyl Nirvana.\nVocals were rich, clean, and slightly forward sounding which I wanted to hear from this table; the Rainier is a good cartridge that does almost nothing wrong but it\u2019s definitely not as punchy as the 2M Blue or E3.\nThe warmer tonal balance works better with more neutral sounding electronics but I wouldn\u2019t start from scratch if your system sounds good to you in that regard. I would stick with a neutral sounding phono preamp if the rest of your system leans that way.\nI was tempted to swap out the Ortofon 2M Black on my TD-160 Super for the Rainier, but I don\u2019t think too many listeners are going to update the $995 Debut Pro with a $700 phono cartridge.\nAnother aspect of the Debut Pro\u2019s performance that really surprised me was its low end impact with Rammstein, The Who, Rush, Metallica, and Daft Punk; most entry-level tables deliver tight and dynamic sounding bass, but it never really comes across with sufficient impact.\nThe Debut PRO hits rather hard with bass-heavy music and if your system can deliver it \u2014 you will experience it. I\u2019ve never felt that way about the Planar 3 which always sounds really quick and detailed in the low end, but rather lightweight.\nPro-Ject has also built a turntable that is remarkably quiet; none of my systems exhibited any level of hum and I could barely hear the motor at all and the platter exhibited excellent speed stability.\nIs there a lot of daylight between the $999 Pro-Ject Debut PRO and tables in the $500 range? Having spent the better part of the pandemic listening to the competition, I would say that Pro-Ject have done something really unique with the Debut PRO that isn\u2019t the flashiest looking table in the category.\nIt\u2019s an excellent platform for listening to records and a well-designed table in every respect. That you can make it even better with a cork mat, different phono cartridge, and not spend a fortune \u2014 that\u2019s a rather great option at a time when everything is more expensive and you have to watch your shekels.\nWould I buy the Pro-Ject Debut PRO for myself and be happy with it long-term if I owned nothing else?\nI think that\u2019s going to happen this year. I hated sending it back because I know I barely scratched the surface of its capabilities within the context of a $10,000 system I used.\nDo you need to spend more than $1,000 on a turntable?\nIf that\u2019s your ceiling \u2014 this is your table.\nFor more information:pro-jectusa.com/product/debut-pro/\nWhere to buy:$999 at Turntable Lab,$765 at Selfridges\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission."

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/jbl-l65-jubal/",
        "content": "In production from 1974-1977, the L65 aka Jubal is a 3-way bass reflex loudspeaker that many consider to be one of JBL\u2019s best in the moderately sized home speaker category. Featuring a beautiful glass top and wood frame, the Jubal was designed to blend in with your interior design and sound fidelity. Outside of its looks, the Jubal is beloved by vintage audio enthusiasts for its balanced and delicate \u201ccrystal slot\u201d tweeter (the Jubal is one of only two models with this tweeter design) which produces a dynamic high frequency response and wide sound dispersion. Crucial to note, while the Jubal was originally intended to be floor-standing, many owners have recommended placing the speakers on stands or tilting them back slightly in order to get the tweeters to ear level.\nRead the product notes from JBL:\n\u201cThe L65 provides unequalled performance within the confines of a compact, free-standing enclosure. It exhibits impeccable accuracy, wide bandwidth, definition and excellent high frequency dispersion \u2013 a combination of performance characteristics typically associated with much larger loudspeaker systems.\nThe system consists of three drivers \u2013 a long excursion, 12-inch low frequency loudspeakers; a powerful, 5-inch midrange transducer; and a wide dispersion, ultra-high frequency driver \u2013 all controlled by a sophisticated frequency dividing network. The low frequency loudspeaker provides bass performance that is clean and solid, the midrange unit contributes the clarity and presence characteristic of vocals or solo instrumentation, and the ultra-high frequency driver faithfully reproduces the overtone structure lying above musical fundamentals for the sparkle and crispness so essential to realism.\nThe L65 maintains its outstanding performance characteristics at all volume levels, from background music to the loudness approaching a live event. Of particular note is the loudspeaker\u2019s reproduction of the overtones and harmonics lying above musical fundamentals. Such overtones and harmonics, which are multiples of the fundamental frequency, quite often extend beyond the range of conscious perception, yet their presence is essential to preserve acoustic realism. The accuracy and extended bandwidth of the ultra-high frequency driver can be easily heard when listening to the clarity of a muted trumpet or the sizzle of brushed cymbals that often underlie a jazz performance.\u201d\nThe Jubals were originally sold for $396 back in the \u201970s. The price has, of course, gone up quite a bit since then, but actually not too significantly after adjusting for inflation. A pair will now cost you around $2-4k, which is comparable to the slightly larger sized Klipsch Cornwall IV\u2019s.\n\u201cI like mine\u2026 A lot of people here and at Lansing Heritage tend to dislike them because they \u201cplay to the knees\u201d and the LE5 mid is over matched by the 077. I have mine on 18 inch stands and they are excellent IMHO. The stand eliminates the floor coupling and gets the excellent tweeters at ear level. They are also a very good looking speaker.\u201d\n\u201cYou do have to work a little to get the best out of the Jubal. I have mine on custom stands. You have to get them off the ground\u2026 No one speaker can be everything to everyone. But my Jubals, in their current recapped state with judicious placement and excellent amplification, are a stunning bargain for under $1000. They are my current personal favorite. The tweets do not spit with great caps, and the mids are smooth and detailed. They are very lush with a seamless sound stage in the wide sweet spot and their frequency response says smooth and musical anywhere in the house.\u201d (2009)\n\u201cI heard them once many years ago when I was in my twenties at one of the \u2018stereo stores\u2019 that were plentiful and friendly back then. The Beach Boys\u2019 \u2018Pet Sounds\u2019 playing at a decibel level that almost drove me out of the listening room. No distortion whatsoever. The Beach Boys were in the room. They were out of my league price-wise, so I never pursued them any further. I have no clue as to how a full orchestra would be rendered on these. Obviously an unforgettable experience.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a super-dynamic speaker, which I like a lot. Mine were too forward in the upper mids for my taste and eventually went the way of all speakers. Many consider the L65 to be a high point in JBL\u2019s modestly sized home speakers. A former boss of mine has used 4 of them with a Marantz 4400 since new and wouldn\u2019t consider anything else.\u201d"

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/grado-labs-prestige-red3-phono-cartridge-an-affordable-turntable-upgrade/",
        "content": "Based on the reaction to myCAF 2023 editorial, many of you agree that high-end audio manufacturers and some show organisers have lost the plot. Our issue is not the availability of expensive high-end products because there will be always be a niche market for systems over $50,000 \u2014 but the lack of focus on the entry level and mid-tier products that can sustain this industry for the long-term.\nDemonstrating $50,000 turntables is fine, but understand that 99.9% of the music listening audience is never buying one.\nThe same applies to manufacturers trying to convince vinyl listeners that it makes sense to spend $3,000 to $,5000 on a phono cartridge.\nNewsflash \u2014 it does not.\nGrado Labsoffers a few phono cartridges that are even more expensive but 95% of their range is affordable.\nIt has always been my advice to invest a majority of your budget in a better turntable and only upgrade the phono cartridge after you have had some time to figure out the table and its base sonic signature; only then should one invest more in an overachieving cartridge like theGoldring E4, GradoTimbre Opus3,Denon DL-103,Nagaoka MP-110,Sumiko Blue Point No. 3orOrtofon 2M Blue.\nCan an inexpensive phono cartridge elevate the sound quality of your turntable?\nEven on a table as affordable as theAndover Audio SpinDeck Max, the $190 USD Grado Labs Prestige Red3 proved to be a genuine surprise.\nSpending $3,000 on a phono cartridge is stupid \u2014 spending anything more than $400 on a cartridge for a turntable under $1,000 is a mistake long-term that will not pay dividends.\nYou are better off buying more records than investing in something with a finite lifespan like a pricey phono cartridge.\nI attribute my 30 year relationship with Grado Labs to our mutual desire to escape sameness. And there is a lot of that in audio these days. Sameness and Brooklyn do not belong on the same page and that is why Grado Labs can never stop being what it is.\nOne of the things that has made Grado Labs so successful over the past 50+ years has been its attention to the bottom line. I was fortunate to visit the \u201cfactory\u201d many years ago in Brooklyn and the biggest takeaway was the dedication of its employees who make all of their headphones and phono cartridges.\nSitting there all day winding and assembling is a very labor intensive task and they made the business decision to keep everything at home. Grado is not a flashy company; there are no fancy offices, press junkets, or bizarre products that make no sense financially. They invested from the beginning in the tooling and machinery and even make their own packaging.\n\u201cGrado doesn\u2019t promote the Red3 as much as the Black3 or Gold3, but it might be the place to start if you\u2019re looking to upgrade the cartridge on your affordable new table or if you\u2019re looking for something for an older vintage turntable.\u201d\nThe 5mV output of the Grado Labs Prestige Red3 makes it compatible with almost every AVR, integrated amplifier, pre-amplifier, and external phono pre-amplifier currently available \u2014 not to mention active orwireless loudspeakerswith internal MM phono stages.\nThe hand assembled Moving Iron (Grado cartridges are not MM) cartridges use a four piece OTL cantilever that has a Grado specific\u00a0diamond mounted on a brass bushing. The Red3 are hand selected from Blue3 production runs which meet higher\u00a0test specifications. Only 10% of that specific run become Red3 cartridges.\nGrado\u2019s coil winding techniques, using ultra high purity copper wire which were honed during the development of the Lineage Series, have let the electrical circuits achieve unison between the four coils in each phono cartridge.\nThe Red3 is powered by a twin magnet system that optimizes the balance between stereo channels. All internal magnetic circuit parts are held to extremely high tolerances creating the desired stereo imaging.\nGrado\u2019s patented Flux-Bridger design allows the Red3 to have one of the lowest effective moving mass generating systems while creating an excellent balance throughout the full frequency range.\nThe weight is on the lower side at 5.5 grams and I actually found that both tonearms preferred a tracking force of 1.6 or 1.7 which is slightly higher than Grado\u2019s recommended 1.5 grams.\nInstallation took around 15 minutes with each tonearm because my gigantic hands made the setup somewhat fiddly; definitely me and not the cartridge at fault.\nPhono stages included the Croft Phono RIAA, Moon by SimAudio LP110 V2, and the internal phono stages of theCyrus Audio i7-XR,Schiit Audio Ragnarok 2,NAD C 316BEE V2, andAudiolab 6000AIntegrated Amplifiers.\nThe Unison Research Triode 25 and Cambridge Audio Edge A Integrated Amplifiers connected to thePro-Ject Phono Tube Box DS2also took turns with the Prestige Red3.\nThe Red3 spent time mounted (that sounds wrong) to the head shell of theAndover Audio SpinDeck Max, andNAD C 588\u2018s tonearms.\nGoldring, Ortofon, and Sumiko cartridges sat in the corner sulking.\nWhat\u2019s fascinating about the Red3 and the Timbre series cartridges (Opus3 review can be read here), is that they represent a modernization of the Grado \u201chouse\u201d sound.\nGrado carts have always had a rich, and lush sounding midrange; the overall tonal balance has certainly favored systems that needed some additional presence in the bass and midrange.\nThat added degree of \u201ccoloration\u201d also got in the way of the overall clarity and detail retrieval of the cartridges.\nWell\u2026those days are done.\nThe Red3 might not offer the overall resolution or clarity of the Opus3, but it\u2019s a much cleaner sounding listen compared to the previous generation of Prestige cartridges \u2014 my daughter\u2019s turntable collection includes aU-Turn Orbit+with a Grado Black2 and an Andover Audio SpinDeck with the Ortofon OM10 \u2014 a comparison before she returned to college revealed that the Red3 is both cleaner, more detailed, and a more spacious sounding cartridge.\nThe tonal balance is still on the warmer side, but it is now far more neutral sounding than the cartridge it replaced. The low end response is tighter, better defined, and not as meaty. Percussion was well defined, fast, and more present in every recording.\nGrado cartridges have always favored the midrange giving vocals and strings a lot of presence and color, and while that strength has not disappeared with the Red3, the overall presentation is far more open and spacious which is a huge plus on an affordable turntable such as theSpinDeck MaxorNAD C 588.\nListening to Sarah Vaughan, Billie Holiday, and Amy Winehouse clearly highlighted the improved sense of clarity, detail, and top end airiness.\nWinehouse\u2019s \u201cValerie\u201d off the BBC Sessions recording can be rather vivid sounding and even somewhat etched in the top end if the cartridge or loudspeakers emphasize the treble too much.\nThe Red3 didn\u2019t posses the resolution or level of top end sweetness of the more expensive Opus3, but it came damn close and without ever sounding hard when the late-Winehouse hit the highest notes.\nHorns have just enough bite without going off the cliff or crashing into the Death Star (Red 3 standing by\u2026sorry Biggs), and I found myself listening to Donald Byrd, Miles Davis, and Eric Dolpy well into the evening as the rain and winds pummeled the Shore last weekend.\nThe Red3 is also very good at handling less than stellar records that have not been cleaned or suffer from some rather ugly scratches.\nOne of the biggest improvements over the previous generation is the soundstage width and depth and the imaging specificity.\nTheMoon by SimAudio LP110 V2was a really good tonal match with the Red3; the Canadian phono pre-amplifier is straight down the middle in the tonal and presentation departments and it really showcased just open the new cartridge can sound if the rest of the system is up to the task.\nVocals were not as lush, but the clarity and resolution took a step forward which I really didn\u2019t expect from a $190 phono cartridge.\nThe Prestige Red3 faces some stiff competition from theGoldring E3andNagaoka MP-110; the British cart is even more neutral sounding from top to bottom and definitely benefits from a warmer sounding system where its resolution, speed, and top end sparkle can work its magic.\nThe Nagaoka is the best tracker of the 3 but it\u2019s also slightly cooler in the midrange; the MP-110 is still one of the best value carts around and probably the biggest rival to the Red3.\nGrado doesn\u2019t promote the Red3 as much as the Black3 or Gold3, but it might be the place to start if you\u2019re looking to upgrade the cartridge on your affordable new table or if you\u2019re looking for something for an older vintage turntable.\nThe high output widens its appeal and it doesn\u2019t fall into the trap of being really good at 1-2 areas and only average in the rest. The midrange is not as warm as you might expect from a Grado cartridge but the newfound detail and clarity really makes it work with a wider range of components and loudspeakers \u2014 which means that it can grow with you as your system improves.\nIt\u2019s a very capable and resolving cartridge at the price and not coming off mySpinDeck Maxanytime soon.\nWhere to buy:$190at Audio Advice|4OurEars\nRelated Podcast:The Best Phono Cartridges Under $350\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission."

        "title": "A Glossary of Essential Hi-Fi Audio Terms from Altec Lansing",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/altec-lansing-audio-terms/",
        "content": "Looking to get deeper into hi-fi, but not sure where to start? Plenty of resources and articles are available online, but they can be difficult to read and often filled with terms that don\u2019t really mean anything when you\u2019re just starting out. Luckily, there are some great resources available from the past geared towards consumers. Back in the golden era of hi-fi in the \u201970s, hi-fi audio manufacturers made it a point to provide all the proper education and resources for their customers. Often released in pamphlets or reference manuals, these guides allowed customers not only better setup their speakers system within their homes, but also understand all the nuances between the company\u2019s products. Klipsch\u2019s cult favoriteDope from Hopeaudio newsletters are one classic example.\nIncluded in Altec Lansing\u2019s 1974 manual titledLoudspeaker Enclosures: Their Design and Use, the following glossary of hi-fi audio terms is essential for any beginner looking to dive in deeper and step up their audio game. For those looking to get into speaker building, check out the full manual available at Lansing Heritage:https://www.lansingheritage.org/html/altec/plans/1974-enc-manual.htm\nA-B Test\u2013 Evaluating the relative performance of two (or more) components or systems by switching quickly from one to the other. In comparing, the sudden contrast can reveal audible differences between the units. The fair method of comparison is with no change in the midband volume level. Due to efficiency differences between speaker systems, a method for compensating sensitivity. differences should be used.\nAcoustic Feedback\u2013 An annoying interference created when sound vibrations from the speaker system cause a vibration in the record player. The phono stylus can pick up these vibrations, which will be reproduced in the speaker system as a rumble or howl. The cure is to properly isolate the record player from the low frequencies of the speaker system.\nAmbience\u2013 A term referencing a condition of room acoustic characteristics. The total of all sound conditions, but generally excluding the direct sound from the per- former or reproducer. Primarily the reflected sound condition, including decay time and frequency emphasis. A condition that might be natural in a hall, or simulated in the record manufacturing process to create a specific hall image.\nAmplifier\u2013 An electronic device for magnifying, and usually controlling, the electrical signals sent to the speaker system. High fidelity amplifying equipment consists of a preamplifier/equalizer section plus a power/ basic amplifier section. In integrated amplifiers, both sections are built on one chassis and made available as a single unit. A receiver adds the tuner section to the integrated amplifier.\nBaffle\u2013 A term applied to many areas of a loudspeaker enclosure. Most generally applied to the enclosure itself, but also widely recognized as the loudspeaker mounting board. In horn, and other complex enclosures, the term is applied to individual boards within the enclosure that shape or change the air flow from the transducer. As baffle can be used in all applications, one has to interpret the writer\u2019s intention as to true meaning.\nBalance\u2013 A ratio term referring to the relative loudness or amplitude between sound sources. The control sections of stereo and quadraphonic amplifiers have balance controls to allow adjustments between speaker systems that have different pressure sensitivity. The term also applies to frequency response balance. For instance most speaker systems have a balance control in the crossover network to allow adjustment of the volume balance between the transducers in the system.\nBass Boom\u2013 An effect created by unwanted bass resonances in the sound reproduction. These resonances can be created by many various sources: improperly designed enclosure, cabinet panels not sufficiently braced, or incorrect enclosure size matching to a particular transducer. This publication should solve these problems. An additional source can be standing waves created in the room acoustics. See Standing Waves.\nCompliance\u2013 In loudspeaker language, the term refers to loudspeaker\u2019s mechanical suspension-and the suspension\u2019s ability to yield to the electrical force applied through the loudspeaker circuit. It is the ratio of cone/ diaphragm displacement to a force applied-the inverse of stiffness. A high compliance cone assembly moves easily, and is relatively freely suspended in the loudspeaker frame.\nCompression/Rarefaction\u2013 A dictionary would define compression as \u201csqueezing together\u201d or \u201cmaking smaller by pressure\u201d. In loudspeaker terms we can use the term two ways. As a loudspeaker cone moves forward, the cone applies pressure to the air adjacent to the cone. As this air is compressed by the pressure, it reacts by moving, in a wave form, in a direction away from the pressure. The effect of minus pressure at the rear of the cone, which causes adjacent air to \u201crush in\u201d and fill the gap of the vacuum created, is called rarefaction. The further use of the term compression relates to certain high frequency transducers. Here the sound waves of the diaphragm are squeezed in a narrow horn throat. The increased pressure and better air coupling offered by a horn, increases efficiency and sound levels-still maintaining low diaphragm travel motion.\nCone/Diaphragm\u2013 At Altec, we generally use the terms loudspeaker cone or loudspeaker diaphragm interchangeably. It has been used by some companies with cone referencing low frequency transducers, and diaphragm for high frequency units. It is the part which acts as the moving piston in the loudspeaker. The cone or diaphragm is suspended or held in the loudspeaker frame, and moves in relation to the varying source of electrical signal applied to the loudspeaker circuit. A cone or diaphragm assembly, as referenced to a dynamic speaker, would include the surround, which supports and holds the cone to the outer frame, the voice coil, which is wire wound onto a support and completes the loudspeaker circuit with the magnetic gap, and the spider, which helps center the voice coil in the gap and attaches the cone to the inner frame support.\nCrossover Network\u2013 The crossover network is used in a speaker system to divide the signal waveform into frequency bands to feed the appropriate loudspeaker transducer-high frequencies to the tweeter and low frequencies to the woofer. In three-way and four-way systems, more complex networks are required to separate the signal, by frequency, for each particular transducer to reproduce.\nDamping\u2013 As damping is applied to a loudspeaker, it expresses the ability of the cone/diaphragm to stop its motion as the electrical input signal ceases. Poor damping allows motion to continue briefly as an automobile with poor shock absorbers. This hangover creates a \u201cblooming\u201d sound to the bass frequencies, and masks clarity. Ampli- fiers also have a damping factor which helps control speaker motion. This effect is sometimes highly debated, but the benefits of an amplifier damping factor greater than 30 may be more theory than reality.\nDecibel\u2013 The decibel is a standard unit of measuring amplitude. Usually abbreviated as \u201cdB\u201d, the standard is a relative term-rather than an absolute. It is used to compare two different levels, such as voltage, current, or sound pressure level.\nDiaphragm\u2013 See Cone/Diaphragm.\nDistortion\u2013 In referencing playback, any change that the playback system imparts to the source or input sound would be classified as distortion. Distortion can exist at any link in the reproducing chain, and all subsequent links will reproduce the distortion created by an earlier link. Distortion exists in two principal forms \u2013 harmonic distortion and intermodulation distortion. Harmonic distortion references the distortion created on the multiple frequencies of a given fundamental frequency. Intermodulation distortion references the interaction of various frequencies, and any distortion created from the interaction. To the ear, IM or intermodulation distortion is generally the most offensive.\nEfficiency\u2013 Efficiency is a term used in discussing loudspeaker output relative to amplifier power input. Efficiency would generally denote a percentage, i.e., 20 percent, 10 percent, or .5 percent efficient. As a 10 percent efficient loudspeaker is high in efficiency, the percentage rating can be misleading. Today\u2019s specifications have a trend towards SPL or sound pressure level. This would reference a given dB of loudness, for a given wattage input, at a given distance from the speaker system. In comparing systems or loudspeakers on this basis, 3 dB difference requires half or twice the power-and 10 dB change requires one tenth or ten times the power for a given stand- ard of input sensitivity measurements.\nEnclosure\u2013 In loudspeaker terms we refer to the enclosure as the acoustically designed housing for the loudspeaker.\nEqualization\u2013 A deliberate, introduced change in frequency response would be called equalization. There are many forms of equalization; as used in disc recording and playback, tape recording and playback, graphic tone balance, room equalization, and speaker equalization. As the term implies, everything comes out \u201cequal\u201d in the end with flat overall response between microphone input and loudspeaker output.\nExcursion\u2013 The actual movement of the cone/diaphragm assembly is referred to as excursion. The allowable cone travel, or excursion, is a factor that is important to high power applications. Linear cone travel is necessary for low distortion.\nFidelity\u2013 The degree of faithfulness to the original accuracy and honesty in sound reproduction. See Distortion.\nFrequency\u2013 The rate of repetition in Hertz of musical pitch, as well as that of electrical signals. Hertz, as previously termed cycles-per-second, tells us how many repetitions exist per second of time in a given signal. Low frequencies refer to bass tones, and high frequencies to treble tones.\nFrequency Response\u2013 The ability of a component to reproduce a range of frequencies is called frequency response. How evenly the component responds to various frequencies within the range describes how \u201cflat\u201d that response would be. In loudspeaker and speaker systems, the quotation of a response range or flatness can be very misleading. The environment in which the measurement takes place can have so many variables, and does not necessarily relate to performance in the listening room, that meaningful specifications relating to frequency response are not currently available for loudspeakers or systems.\nHertz\u2013 See Frequency.\nImpedance\u2013 An engineering term which describes the degree to which a circuit impedes the flow of an alternating current. See text for fuller explanation as applies to loudspeakers.\nLoudness Compensation\u2013 The human ear experiences a loss in sensitivity, particularly in the bass frequencies, and somewhat in the high frequencies, at low volume levels. Loudness compensation corrects this by increasing the bass frequencies and highs in the correct proportions as the volume is decreased from a concert level.\nLoudspeaker/Transducer\u2013 The terms Altec uses to describe the unmounted loudspeaker. Also referred to as a \u201craw frame\u201d loudspeaker, and designates without an enclosure.\nPhase\u2013 Refers to any part of a sound wave or an electrical signal with respect to its passage in time. Two devices are in-phase when they furnish the signal or sound simultaneously. They are out-of-phase to the extent that, at a point in time, one lags or leads the other. In two-way and three-way speaker systems, it might be necessary, as a part of design, to create an out-of-phase electrical condition in order to create an in-phase acoustical condition.\nPower\u2013 Power is the electrical energy developed to do work, such as the power from an amplifier used to drive a speaker system. Also, acoustical energy or sound pressure developed in a room by a speaker system.\nPressure Sensitivity\u2013 The specification of pressure sensitivity relates to the sound pressure level from loudspeaker output, relative to a given electrical power input. See also Efficiency.\nResonance\u2013 Resonance refers to the tendency of any physical body to vibrate most freely at one particular frequency. In audio, the electrical and mechanical resonances of the various components must be controlled so that they do not affect the tonal quality of the music being reproduced. Also see text concerning impedance and resonance.\nRoom Acoustics\u2013 The natural acoustics of the listening room play a large part in determining the overall sound of the system. Altec encourages your experimentation in various speaker placements to determine what sounds best in your room. In general, attempt to have opposite surfaces of opposite textures-such as hard and absorbent. Also see further information under Standing Waves.\nRumble\u2013 As its name suggests, rumble is a low frequency rumbling noise produced by poorly built turntables or record changers. Because of the low frequencies of rumble, it can often be confused with acoustic feedback. Proper speaker system placement requires a good under- standing of both acoustic feedback and rumble.\nSpider\u2013 The spider is the name of the mechanical collar, located at the neck of the cone/diaphragm, which fastens the cone to the inner portion of the loudspeaker frame and helps keep the voice coil centered in the magnetic gap.\nStanding Waves\u2013 As the sound or music is reproduced from the speaker systems, the wave fronts move forward through the listening room, hit the opposite wall, and are then reflected back into the listening area. Depending on the ceiling height, room width and length, these waves can create an in-phase or out-of-phase condition which is detrimental to reproduction. Most frequent problems in the average room occur with an in-phase condition at 80 and 200 Hz. The goal is to eliminate these standing waves by experimenting with various speaker placements.\nSurround\u2013 The surround is the mechanical collar which fastens the outer edge of the cone/diaphragm to rim of the loudspeaker basket. Various materials are used to achieve the degree of compliance desired.\nWatts\u2013 The watt is a unit of electrical or acoustical power. The term designates the power consumed in an electrical device. In audio we specify not the power to keep the amplifier running, but rather the amount of audio power the amplifier is capable of delivering to the speaker sys- tem. Because the loudspeaker is not a particularly efficient device, the acoustic output power from the loudspeaker, in watts, is far less than the amplifier audio power input."

        "title": "Speaker Wire Doesn\u2019t Matter. Does it?",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/speaker-wire/",
        "content": "If you hang out in a hi-fi group for any length of time, inevitably the question of speaker wire comes up. What gauge? Regular copper or oxygen free? Does copper purity matter? What about distance from speaker to amp? Should you worry about conductivity? Corrosion resistance?\nThese are valid questions, but the more you research and learn the more you see that there are a lot of shysters out there looking to profit off of what, in the end, regards a simple equation easily solved.\nThe oft-ridiculous arguments for and against certain approaches to connecting speakers to amplifier can be best synopsized by this comment on a popular Facebook group:\n\u201cCloth lamp cord from the 1960s. But it has to be made in Baltimore not Chicago. And it has to be made on Tuesday in the AM not any other day.\u201d\nAt the other end of the spectrum is another response arguing that it makes no difference unless there\u2019s a question of distance:\n\u201cHome depot 16/2 lamp wire \u2026don\u2019t spend one cent more unless you are running it over 50 feet.\u201d\nAmid all of these conversations about speaker wire, we came acrossa fascinating storythat pretty much debunks 90% of the arguments for investing too heavily into speaker wire. Written by audio engineer Roger Russell, it presents an overview of the various arguments for and against listening differences based on wire quality. The most compelling was a story about Gordon Gow, president of McIntosh:\nIn the early 1980\u2019s, special speaker wires were beginning to appear on the market. Some of the claims were totally unbelievable and had prices to match. Realizing that wire resistance was the critical factor in speaker wire, Gordon Gow, President of McIntosh Laboratory, used a speaker cable demonstration to show there was no listening difference between these wires and plain line cord. He delivered his presentation about the truth in speaker wire using a reel of Monster cable to stand on. Fifty-foot lengths of wire were used in the comparison.\nThe controlled demonstration provided an instant A/B comparison. Listeners didn\u2019t know the wire configuration. The result: \u201cIt can be solid, stranded, copper, oxygen free copper, silver, etc. \u2014 or even \u2018magic\u2019 wire \u2014 as long as the resistance is kept to be less than 5% ofthe speaker impedance. There is no listening difference as long as the wire is of adequate size.\u201d Gow performed this demonstration all over the country.\nIn a 1983 issue of Stereo Review, writer Laurence Greenhill published a survey called, \u201cSpeaker Cables: Can You Hear the Difference?\u201d Notes Russell:  \u201cIt compared Monster cable, 16-gauge wire and 24-gauge wire. The price at that time for a pair of 30-foot lengths of monster cables was $55.00. The cost for 16 gauge heavy lamp cord was $.30/foot or $18.00 and the 24 gauge \u201cspeaker wire\u201d was $.03/foot or $1.80.\u201d\nGreenhill\u2019s conclusion?\nSo what do our fifty hours of testing, scoring and listening to speaker cables amount to? Only that 16-gauge lamp cord and Monster cable are indistinguishable from each other with music and seem to be superior to the 24 gauge wire commonly sold or given away as \u2018speaker cable.\u2019\nHe did include a caveat, though:\nRemember, however, that it was a measurable characteristic \u2014 higher resistance per foot \u2014 that made 24-gauge sound different from the other cables. If the cable runs were only 6 instead of 30 feet, the overall cable resistances would have been lower and our tests would probably have found no audible differences between the three cables.\nStill, the conclusion was pretty definitive:\nThis project was unable to validate the sonic benefits claimed for exotic speaker cables over common 16-gauge zip cord. We can only conclude, therefore, that there is little advantage besides pride of ownership in using these thick, expensive wires.\nRead more about these tests and argumentsat Russell\u2019s site, which features this useful old school HTML chart:"

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/thorens-td-1500/",
        "content": "Does familiarity truly breed contempt? Having invested a sizeable amount of money over the past decade in three restored Thorens turntables fromVinyl Nirvana, there was both intense interest and some skepticism on my part in regard to the new Thorens TD 1500 Turntable.\nSwiss-made (or German-made depending on the decade) Thorens turntables have been prized by audiophiles for both their sound quality and precision engineering since 1957 with the launch of the TD-124 idler drive turntable, and that list has grown over the years to include the TD-145, TD-150, TD-160/Super, and TD-125 belt-driven models.\nThorens relocated their manufacturing to Germany, Poland, and Switzerland during some rather tumultuous decades for the company as it struggled to combat the birth of digital audio, and only recently in 2018 was restructured with new ownership that is based in Germany.\nThorens is back in the game of manufacturing brand new high-end turntables but has shown little interest in supporting legacy products that were some of the best belt-driven turntables ever made.\nSo why buy a used Thorens and have It restored to its original glory?\nWhy not buy something new?\nThorens is making a strong case for itself with new models like the TD 1500, TD 1600/1601 andTD 124 DD.\nThe TD 1500 pays homage to the ground breaking TD-150 and whilst there are some similar design cues \u2014 the modern version offers a number of substantial changes that make it far more user friendly and competitive from a performance perspective with other turntables in the $3000 to $4,000 range.\nSticking with the past, the Thorens TD 1500 is a manually operated deck that still features a sub-chassis that is designed to decouple the turntable and tonearm base from the motor and frame through 3 conical springs.\nThe difference between the older deck and the TD 1500 is that the springs can now be adjusted from above through corresponding holes that have been drilled into the platter.\nHaving used a TD-145, TD-160 Super, and TD-125 for the better part of a decade, there is no question that the TD 1500 is easier to adjust and forget.\nThere is also no question that it bests the TD-145 and TD-160 Super in some areas rather handily. Not entirely sold on that when it comes to the TD-125.\nThorens now offers the TD 1500 with the Ortofon 2M Bronze; which is an entirely appropriate high output MM cartridge for a table of this caliber. Some users will likely install something different, but it proved to be very competitive against my own Thorens tables with Dynavector, Ortofon, and Goldring cartridges installed.\nAnother new twist is the inclusion of both RCA and balanced XLR outputs on the rear panel of the TD 1500; thePro-Ject X2 Bthat resides in my office system is another deck that offers a similar set-up but for less money.\nAt the time of the review, I did not have an external phono preamp with balanced inputs/outputs to ascertain if that would make any difference; and with the 2M Bronze being a MM cartridge \u2014 a somewhat irrelevant test.\nLet\u2019s be frank. The tonearm offered on the original TD-150 was rather crude and it explains why SME tonearms were so popular on Thorens decks over the years.\nThe TP 150 tonearm, which reminds one of much older EMT arms from around the time that I was born, offers superior build quality, adjustability, and the Ortofon-designed detachable head shell.\nIts operation on the TD 1500 was extremely smooth and one can tell that the bearings were no afterthought.\nHaving used a Rega tonearm on my TD-160 Super for many years, there is no question that the TP 150 is superior from a built quality perspective and offers a much higher level of refinement.\nThe Rega, however, works extremely well with the Ortofon 2M Black that has been used on it for the past 5 years; I did have a custom counterweight made for it and the internal wiring is Cardas.\nIt is definitely not a stock version of the RB300.\nThorens provides all of the necessary tools to finalize the cartridge installation; including an excellent overhang gauge, which is in the form of a LP-sized template with a strobe disc on the other side.\nThe anti-skate is set for you at the factory which was a nice touch.\nInstallation was rather easy.\nRemove the two transit screws, position the high quality belt, platter and record mat, install the head shell with the pre-installed 2M Bronze and mount the counterweight.\nAnother advantage is the TD 1500\u2019s electronically-controlled motor, providing automatic speed change.\nComparing the 4 turntables, the TD 1500 offers superior speed stability and the tonearm offers very little play; the decades of technological advancement have produced a table that is better engineered and certainly easier to setup and maintain.\nThe original TD 150 and the TD 1500 are rather similar in size and weight; the new deck is 42 x 15 x 36cm compared to the original which was 39.4 x 12.5 x 32.5cm (W x H x D).\nThe bigger change involves the new platter that is only 1.4 kg compared to the 3.2 kg platter of the original. The TD 1500 weighs in at 8 kg versus the 6.7 kg of the TD 150.\nFrom a build quality perspective, there is no comparison. Everything about the TD 1500 is more solidly constructed and that includes the armboard. The TD 1500 and the TD-125 share a lot in common in that regard. Both are solid decks and likely to last longer than their owners.\nThe TD 1500 is available with either a black or walnut plinth; definitely go for the walnut finish.\nThorens tables most certainly have a \u201chouse\u201d sound that is less accurate sounding than a VPI or Clearaudio turntable.\nNobody has ever described a Thorens deck as being \u201cclinical\u201d or \u201coverly neutral\u201d and that is certainly part of the charm \u2014 at least it has always been that way for myself.\nThe TD 1500 still offers the trademark presence and weight of a quality Thorens deck, but there is no question that the edges are more refined and everything is delivered with greater pace.\nRega pacing?\nNot entirely sure one could say that it moves music along with the speed of a Rega Planar 8, but it does conduct its business with more of an attitude than any of my restored decks.\nListening to a wide range of newBlue Note Tone Poet releasesconfirmed a few other new details about the TD 1500.\nThorens decided to keep the midrange of the TD 1500 consistent with older designs in terms of timbre and texture, but the clarity and resolution are very different; every instrument within the mix was easier to discern and the uptick in detail was notable into the lower treble.\nI would be the first to concede that my older Thorens tables don\u2019t exactly illuminate the treble range as well as other decks; and that is with some excellent cartridges like the Dynavector 10\u00d75, Ortofon 2M Black, andGoldring Eroica HX.\nThere is less treble energy compared to the TD 1500 and it was especially noticeable with myMagnepan LRS/Cambridge Edge A combination that the new design is slightly thinner sounding overall \u2014 which is trade-off for the improvements in overall clarity and top end detail.\nMale vocals have greater tonal weight through the older tables, but they are also not carved as precisely within the soundstage and there is no question that the TD 1500 pushes vocals further out into the room.\nAre the changes huge? Not necessarily depending on the rest of your system, but the TD 1500 was certainly not overly polite with any recording and the additional top end energy was never a bad thing.\nThe Thorens ethos remains but with a more, modern sounding edge.\nThe low end is better defined; although not necessarily thicker or more resolute sounding.\nFor myself, a turntable needs to offer accurate speed stability, strong presentation of timbre and texture, and genuine presence to stand out.\nTables that offer a clinical reproduction of music don\u2019t cut the mustard. Regardless of price or engineering excellence.\nDid Thorens play it safe with the TD 1500?\nNot really.\nThey simply took what was excellent about older decks and refined it with improved clarity, better detail retrieval, and a quicker sounding presentation.\nThe biggest improvement is the tonearm which will work with a wide range of high-endMC and MC cartridgesmaking this turntable a rather exceptional platform to enjoy your record collection.\nThe build quality is excellent and most certainly superior to the decks that came before it.\nThe TD 1500 may not offer the sex appeal of the TD-125 orPro-Ject X2 B\u2014 but that\u2019s not what should matter to you in the end.\nOne of the reasons why I invested so much money in 3 restored Thorens turntables is that they were built to last and deliver excellent sound quality that I can pass down one day to my children and grandchildren.\nThe TD 1500 joins that illustrious club with even greater swagger.\nWhere to buy:$2,999at B&H Photo\nFor more information:thorens.com\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission."

        "title": "Altec Lansing Model 19: Studio Quality Sound for Home Listening",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/altec-lansing-model-19/",
        "content": "Released in 1976, the Altec Lansing Model 19 was a 2-way vented floor type speaker system that introduced a new technology developed by Altec engineer Clifford A. Henricksen: theradial phase plug / Tangerine driver, which greatly improved the speaker\u2019s high frequency response. Beloved for its crystal clear and natural sound (likened to studio monitors), sensitivity, and wide soundstage, the Model 19 has over the decades become regarded as one of the best home speakers systems ever made and, to some ears, even rivaled Paul W. Klipsch\u2019s legendary Klipschorns. From the Model 19 brochure\u2019s liner notes:\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done some intense research into speaker performance limits, resulting in radical new technology in our high frequency drivers\u2026 the radial phase plug, the key to Nineteen\u2019s versatility. This sharp contrast to conventional phase plug design is the innovative force behind the wide-range capabilities of the Model Nineteen, offering a system proving the ultimate in full range response.\nIf you\u2019re looking for extremely low distortion, top power capacityplusextended bandwidth \u2013 look no further. The Nineteen offers all the bandwidth advantages with none of the crossover problems found in many floor-standing three-way systems. The result: a powerful two-way system with unequaled high-end plus commanding low-end response.\nThe Nineteen also features a dual-range equalizer designed to allow smooth, gradual equalization, compensating for variations in room acoustics or personal listening tastes.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s overwhelming full-range capability and response is aided by an optimally tuned, vented enclosure, the product of more exhaustive investigation, which makes the Nineteen ideal for home listeners who want studio-monitor performance and quality.\nAlso, the Nineteen\u2019s beautifully-styled oiled oak or walnut cabinet, hand-rubbed and finished on all sides, makes it an integral part of any listening environment.\u201d\nThe Model 19\u2019s originally sold for $659 MSRP. Of course, times have changed\u2026 These days, a pair typically goes for around $2k to $5k on the used market, which is comparable to vintage Klipsch Cornwalls. The used market pricing for Model 19\u2019s is typically dependent on the condition of the foam that surrounds the horns. If you find a pair that has the foam deteriorated or completely rotten, it\u2019s possible to purchase a custom made set of replacements from independent makers with some research.\n\u201cAltec 19 replaced my Cornwalls which were recapped and had MAHL tweeters. Deeper in the lows, and faster bass with shorter transients in general, and smoother mids: less shouty.\u201d\n\u201cI have Nineteens, and love them. I have lots of other speakers also, but the Nineteens are currently the daily use speakers, driven by a McIntosh MC240, plenty of power. What do I like the most about them? The way that they can present music exceptionally well, and image well, at low volumes (SPLs) as well as high. Many speakers tend to need to be \u2018turned up\u2019 before you hear all of the music and detail, not the Nineteens.\u201d\n\u201cAs much as I love Klipsch, the 19s, for me, are the best overall speaker I\u2019ve ever heard. Yes, they are a 2 way, instead of the 3-way big Klipsch\u2026 but Paul always wanted the Klipschorn to be a 2 way \u2013 hence the Jubilee. The\u00a019s have all the presence of Klipsch, but have a very natural and real sound.\u00a0 Having a direct radiating 15\u2033 woofer, I\u2019m sure there is more modulation distortion at high levels in the 19s than the Klipschorn or La Scala, but at the levels I listen, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever hear it. The 19s have a very different sound than Klipsch, and if I had the space/money, there would be a set of La Scala in my home as well.\u00a0Everyone has their own tastes, but I would say the 19s are definitely worth a listen at least \u2013 if for nothing more than experiencing essentially a legend within the audio world, just like Klipsch.\u201d"

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/the-art-of-the-piano-trio-exit-to-vintage-street/",
        "content": "Every now and then, a listening session turns into something more. You lose yourself for a few minutes, or for a whole record side. You engage with the music. You float and drift amongst the notes and instruments. Time stops. Transcendent. This is what it\u2019s all about. A better quality audio system takes this to another level, and my first experience in ajazz kissain Japan changed everything for me.\nThe transcendent experience doesn\u2019t happen all the time, but occurred a few evenings ago listening to Billy Taylor and his trio on the 1959 release,One for Fun. With Earl May on bass and Kenny Dennis on drums driving the rhythm on a tight and soulful outing. Perfect. It made me start to think about the piano trio sub-genre of jazz, and what made me fall in love with that combination.\nEarly in my jazz listening, I was drawn to the pyrotechnics of the trumpet and sax. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I still love those instruments and groupings that include one or both, but there\u2019s something about the trio. The most elemental, and intimate grouping. Just piano, bass and drums. Piano typically in the lead, but a far more democratic grouping than when the limelight-stealing brass are involved. Bass and drums with more to say in the musical dialogue, and greater soloing opportunities for these oft neglected instruments.\nLee Morgan can take the night off.\nThere are so many great pianists for listeners to explore; some well-known, and some flying under the radar. A list of the major artists should include: Bill Evans, Wynton Kelly, Red Garland, Chick Corea and Herbie Hancock, all famous for their work with Miles Davis, and for their own trio work. McCoy Tyner of John Coltrane\u2019s famous quartet and Horace Silver of the Jazz Messengers, both leaders and creators of some of the most memorable music from the period. Sonny Clark, Thelonious Monk and Oscar Peterson; all known for their supporting roles on some of jazz\u2019s greatest albums, and for their own projects as leaders.\nAnd who can forget Dave Brubeck, Ahmad Jamal or Duke Ellington. Bud Powell probably belongs on this list as well. The Philadelphia-native recorded some beautiful albums over the course of his career with Charlie Parker and others;Jazz Giantis a must listen if you\u2019ve never heard it and want a serious taste of his playing and compositional skills. A very underrated jazz pianist that you need to explore.\nNow if you\u2019re not a big reader, and you haven\u2019t explored most of these artists yet, you can stop right now. Truth be told, you could build a substantial jazz collection on just Bill Evans\u2019 and Oscar Peterson\u2019s work as band leaders and sidemen. But dig and explore a little deeper and wider; you will discover that there are numerous other underappreciated jazz pianists to be found. This is where I\u2019ve been playing of late, and I\u2019ve been loving some of the relatively unknown but stellar pianists and recordings that I\u2019ve dug up.\nTwo very distinct experiences spring-boarded my curiosity and have informed my ongoing piano trio explorations. First, in May 2019, my wife and I went to Japan for a few weeks to have a holiday and visit family and friends. Japan is a special place and there are aspects of it \u2013 from the perspective of the music listener \u2013 that we really don\u2019t have here.\nA secondary mission this trip was to visit as manyJazz kissas(jazz bars/coffee shops) as possible. The Japanese culture puts a great deal of importance on ceremony. To have a cup of tea at akissaten(\u201ctea-drinking shop\u201d) while listening to jazz has been a part of Japanese culture since 1929, but the modern connection between kissa and tea is more tenuous. Kissa are more about coffee (which also became popular during the American occupation), because coffee and jazz together were seen as very western and exotic.\nThe Second World War had a profound impact on the jazz kissa movement; listening to American jazz music was obviously forbidden with the two countries engaged in warfare across the Pacific and it had to remain underground during the war years. American jazz artists became popular again in Japan in the 1950s and 1960s, but very few people could afford the prices of the records. That reality made the jazz kissa the only place that the average person could enjoy the music.\nOur first night in Fukuoka, my wife met up with an old friend, so I headed out for some solo exploring and happened across a spot calledJazz Bar Browny. Arriving quite early (they had just opened, and the place was empty), I grabbed a seat at the bar and started chatting with the\u201cmaster\u201d(bartender and owner). He asked if I had any requests, and I suggested Duke Jordan\u2019sFlight to Jordan.\nOn it went. Perfect for this setting and their superb system. They really do have a very different appreciation of music and jazz in Japan and I long for the day that I can experience something similar in Canada or the United States. It will never have the same atmosphere as the jazz kissas in Japan, but I think we need them. It might sound somewhat crazy (and even sad) to some, but jazz listeners in Japan will spend an entire day and evening listening to their favorite jazz recordings (both vinyl and CDs) in a jazz kissa. It serves as an opportunity to socialize, drink, and enjoy a lot of wonderful music on some excellent audio systems.\nThe Japanese do not have a lot of space. Certainly not the kind of space for the systems used in these jazz bars and coffee shops. The jazz kissa provides an opportunity to really experience music in a special way.\n\u201cOne night in a Japanese jazz kissa changed music listening for me forever. My love for the jazz piano trio began in the most unique way possible.\u201d\nDuke and his crew sounded amazing, and at the end of the first side the master asked me for my top pianists. I mentioned some of the aforementioned artists. On reflection I wonder if he thought I was some ignorant westerner who read that list in a stereo magazine.\nHis gleeful response made me realize how lucky I was to be in that special moment.\n\u201cTonight, I will teach you about my favourite jazz piano players!\u201d he yelled across the bar which was starting to get busy.\nAnd so began a procession of performers and records I\u2019d never heard of. Some got played (and have since been added to my collection), and some only talked about, photographed and filed away for later reference.\nThat night changed music for me.\nBilly Taylor \u2013One for Fun(1959): The album that got me started on this article, and that I happily managed to track down just a few months ago. Taylor was not just a brilliant pianist and composer, but a jazz educator and promoter as well. Leonard Feather called him, indisputably \u201cthe world\u2019s foremost spokesman for jazz.\u201d He recorded prolifically in the \u201850s and \u201860s, but much of his discography is out of print and tough to find, particularly on vinyl. His swinging, bebop playing is elegant, crisp, brightly playful and inventive, and guaranteed to put a huge smile on your face.\nTsuyoshi Yamamoto \u2013Night and Day Live at Misty(2014): Yamamoto is a Browny favorite and performs there regularly. He was self-taught (as far as jazz piano is concerned). In the 1970s, he was both the house pianist at Misty, a Tokyo jazz club for which this album was recorded for their 30thanniversary, and recorded prolifically by the renown Japanese jazz label,Three Blind Mice. His playing features energetic, funky syncopation, and a dominant right hand. Yamamoto gets an audience to move its feet.\nJack Wilson \u2013Jack Wilson Quartet featuring Roy Ayers(1963): This was Wilson\u2019s first album as leader, with Roy Ayers on vibes making this not a trio recording, but maintaining the democratic trio feel. Wilson\u2019s playing has been knocked for being derivative, with comparisons drawn to Bud Powell and Horace Silver, but I\u2019m no expert on that and truly enjoy his jaunty, bouncing, rhythmic style. I get predictive hints of Ryo Fukui (whom he predated) in some of his work, which is certainly nothing to complain about.\nMichel Sardaby \u2013Blue Sunset(1970): Sardaby hails from the island of Martinique in the Caribbean but moved to Paris in the \u201860s where he began his career, before settling in New York.Blue Sunset, recorded in Paris with Gilbert Rovere and Philippe Combelle, is a perfect late-night post-bop spin; warm, sophisticated, laid-back, and infused with a touch of the blues. It is easy to imagine that you\u2019re in some dark piano bar just before closing. I\u2019ve since found several more of his releases, and they share a similar vibe, with later albums featuring more of a Latin swing.\nOther records pulled and not played that night were by Dick Morgan, Morris Nanton, Monty Alexander, Harold Mabern and\u00a0Tete Montoliu. For some I\u2019ve added records to the collection, and others still feature on the Discogs wish list, to be explored at a later date.\nMy second \u201ctrio experience\u201d \u2013 more prolonged \u2013 took place on our return to Canada in June. With curiosity aroused, I looked further into Japanese jazz artists; and pianists in particular. This brought me back full circle tomy first brushes with jazz 25+ years earlier. Over and over, I came across\u00a0Ryo Fukui, the godfather of Japanese jazz piano (or at least the most famous jazz pianist outside Japan). I ordered a copy ofScenery, his 1976 debut, and from the cover image and further reading about his origins, connected the dots to my time living in Sapporo in the early \u201890s and listening to him play live on Wednesday nights.\nFollowing the breadcrumbs and reading more about Fukui, led me toBarry Harris, another performer-educator cited as one of his biggest influences and best friends. He wasn\u2019t a performer that I was familiar with, but I soon realized that I needed to learn more about him as he\u2019d accompanied the likes of Art Farmer, Donald Byrd, Dexter Gordon, Hank Mobley, Thad Jones and Lee Morgan on some of my favourite records.PreminadoandThe Last Time I Saw Parissoon joined the growing piano trio collection of albums at home.\nFurther investigation of Japanese jazz piano stars brought Toshiko Akiyoshi to my attention, discovered playing in Ginza by a touring Oscar Peterson in 1953. He brought her to the attention of Verve\u2019s Norman Granz, and off she went into the world of famous jazz artists.\nAkiyoshi was well known in the United States in the \u201850s and \u201860s for her small ensemble work (as leader and with first husband, Charlie Mariano), and in the \u201870s for her big band work with second husband, Lew Tabackin. What makes her work distinctive is the inclusion of Japanese melodies and themes (and sometimes instruments), while always staying true to jazz sensibilities. Her 1978 release,Finesse, is a beautiful trio recording.\nAnd so for me the jazz piano journey continues, with diversions and further discoveries to be made (if you have suggestions, message me at@audioloveyyc). I know I\u2019ve missed a slew of other fine pianists here, including\u00a0Tommy Flanagan, Horace Parlan,\u00a0Duke Pearson, Kenny Drew, and more. Mentioned or ignored, all the artists appearing in this article are worthy of a listen. A return to Japan to enjoy music at my favorite jazz kissa is long overdue.\nI hope I\u2019ve sparked some interest here in a rich and enjoyable jazz style. If I have, you\u2019re in for a real treat as you work your way through some of these artists. And if you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed wondering where to start, blindfold yourself and throw darts; you can\u2019t go wrong.\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission."

        "title": "Five heirloom vintage amplifiers for those with holiday money on the way",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/five-heirloom-amplifiers/",
        "content": "Here\u2019s a scenario that virtually anyone who has entered the home listening game by investing in a vintage power amp or receiver has likely confronted, one that\u2019s particularly timely for those who have gift money coming. You\u2019re aware of the brands \u2014 Sansui, McIntosh, Marantz, Pioneer, Harman Kardon \u2014 but you don\u2019t know where to start and you don\u2019t want to mess up by buying something temperamental.\nThe good news is that the internet exists, and so do very smart people who know how stuff works. Whole forums are devoted to which companies\u2019 components still hum like Cadillacs and which turned out to be Saturns. For instance, we asked a crowded vintage gear Facebook group this question: \u201cWe\u2019re compiling a list of 10 great vintage solid state amps for $600 or so. What models need to be on the list to avoid embarrassing ourselves?\u201d\nThe volume and variety of responses were overwhelming: Commenters recommended both receivers and integrated amps, resulting in a drool-worthy bunch of potential purchases.\nWe all enter audiophilia and intentional listening as novices looking for answers. Here are a few.\n\u201cThe NAD 3020 is a no-frills, moderately priced amplifier designed to provide state of the art performance and volume levels far in excess of what would be expected from its conservative 20 W per channel power rating,\u201d reads the ad copy for the NAD 3020. A perennial favorite, it was a huge seller for NAD. As such, there are a lot of 3020s around. For a deeper dive on this amp, check outEric Pye\u2018s article\u201cThe NAD 3020 and My Quest for the Holy Grail: Exit to Vintage Street\u201dforecoustics.\nYou may remember this amp from thesecond edition of our room recordings. The Eico Hf-81 was first introduced in 1959 and is a low powered 14W amplifier that pairs well with efficient speakers (they sound great with our vintage Klipsch Cornwalls). It\u2019s a bit harder to find than the rest of these on the list and may take a bit of work to tune and maintain, but once properly set up, this unassuming amp will beat out most anything you\u2019ll find in its $800 \u2013 $1,000 price range. There\u2019s been a growing cult following around this one so grab it if you can find one at a good price.\nSeriously. Trust us on this one: The Harmon Kardon 730 receiver is not only a beautiful thing, but it offers a warmth of tone that will transform the sound of any record for the better. In advertisements, the company characterizes its product as \u201cbeyond specifications,\u201d which is true.\nFounded by hi-fi legend Robert Carver outside of Seattle, Phase Linear started in the basement of a grocery store in 1971 but within a few years was blowing away audiophiles around the world. A massive amp, it\u2019s another easily found, immediately rewarding purchase.\nA company that earned a reputation for, in its words, \u201cproducing state-of-the-art power amplifiers at rock-bottom prices,\u201d Hafler offered its models as both kits and finished products.\u00a0This beast of an amp is a lesser-known gem, as are the other models in the company\u2019s DH series, including the 220 and 500."

        "content": "Before there was Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Record Store Day, or any other retail sales event, audiophile magazines such as Stereophile and High Fidelity ran the gifting game when it came to sound systems, components, and accessories. Full page ads delivered suggestive images of speakers and decks known to arouse the interests of deep listeners. If it looks this good on the page, the ads seemed to say, imagine how it will perform in your bedroom or living room.\nFor those of us with an affinity for vintage machinery, the components built in the 1970s have endured because they\u2019re sturdy, beautiful, repairable (mostly), and less expensive than new gear of equal quality. It doesn\u2019t hurt that many of the most desirable components either had limited runs or came and went without much fanfare, resulting in a quest-driven mentality 50 years later akin to metal detectorists scouring ruins in search of gold.\nEach December in the 1970s, the monthly magazine High Fidelity delivered a holiday gift guide that offered suggestions for sound freaks \u2014 accessories, components, etc. Though many of the specific products are no longer available, the overview remains rich with ideas that are still relevant to contemporary listeners.\nWe\u2019d kill for that GLI 5880 Creative Controller. Adjusted for inflation, that $600 mixer would cost more than $1,700. And though the home entertainment furniture to its right is cheesy, it serves as a reminder that quality record shelving remains a concern for record nerds old and young.\nIn fact,Sound & Vision, In Sheep\u2019s Clothing and dublab\u2019s seasonal market dedicated to music, hi-fi equipment, and accessories, is showcasing the work of our favorite LA shelving builders,R/D Record Cabinets, which look a ton better than the \u201ctraditional\u201d unit in the ad above.\nAt the market, we\u2019ve teamed with vendors to sell updated versions of stuff like below, including an essential gift for every analog obsessive: a Zerostat gun to zap away the static. Though Lencolamp LL-1\u2019s are hard to come by, systems such as theUberLight flex clamp LED turntable lampdo a better job anyway.\nWe copied these images from the Dec. 1977High Fidelitygift guide, an ad-driven supplement that, while a pay-for-placement endeavor, 45 years later can still offer ideas. The Garrard turntable below retailed at $189.50. A used one will set you back about $1,000 today.\nToo much to spend? Perhaps one of the monochromatic group of men below can entice you with a pair of Tandberg speakers, a receiver, or a reel-to-reel?\nA dispersion base such as the Rectilinear (below left) is a brilliant idea for your family system. If you can\u2019t find a used pair, the Wharfedale Linton stand is an excellent option. The same is true for bookshelf speakers, though maybe not the pint-sized brand below.\nThose in New York should know that In Sheep\u2019s Clothing NYC is hosting our first-everNew York Record Fairthis Sunday, Dec. 3 at Port Sa\u2019id. Though we won\u2019t be hawking any Lenoclamps, Recilinear dispersion bases or Parametric equalizers, we will be joined by vendors and labels including Luaka Bop, Daptone, Superior Elevation, The Mixtape Club and more. In addition to vinyl, DJ\u2019s, dips, and drinks, you can search through the crates of some of NYC\u2019s best labels and vendors from 12-6 PM. After, ISC NYC will host a special dedicated listening session."

        "title": "Turntable cartridges, Groovetickler and the beauty of micro-engineering",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/cartridges-groovetickler/",
        "content": "You likely know this, but the mechanical thing at the tip of your tonearm is as important as your turntable, amplifier or speakers when it comes to getting the most out of your music. About size of a Lego brick, that machine, called a cartridge, is the miraculous device that turns the sound waves inside a record groove into an electronic signal. The signal is then amplified and shot out of your speakers \u2014 as those reconstituted sound waves.\nWhat you might not fully appreciate is the sheer bounty of cartridges built over the years, both by successful brands and by solo geniuses who understand the engineering and treat them as mini works of art. No one celebrates this world better than Joseph Long, aka Groovetickler, a self-described \u201cHigh Fidelity Pickup Artist\u201d who offers \u201cfull service retipping, diamond-only replacement, coil rewinds, suspension repairs.\u201d\nA cartridge mechanic who restores and rebuilds those loaded little magical boxes, Groovetickler documents his projectson Instagram, where he regularly uploads exquisitely photographed images like this one. (All photos are from Grooveticker\u2019s Instagram.)\nThe description that Long provides next to the Sumiko cartridge above offers a glimpse of the cartridge universe:\nRare Sumiko SH\u014c high output moving coil cartridge, once retipped by van den Hul. This now has a fresh new Fritz Gyger r/R 5/100 micron FG 2 diamond installed on the original boron cantilever for one of my earliest clients. This client started sending me cartridges way back when I was just experimenting when I was known on AudioKarma as \u201cNeedlestein,\u201d and he gave me a lot of positive feedback, encouragement and confidence.\nLong mentions a few different crucial components that make up a cartridge in that description. They\u2019re defined below.\nFritz Gyger r/R 5/100 micron FG 2 diamond: That\u2019s the stylus \u2014 the tiny pointed component that directly contacts the grooves. Like all styli, this Fritz Gyger reads the microscopic variations in the groove walls and translates them into vibrations.\nCantilever: a slender rod connecting the stylus (needle) to the internal generator system within the cartridge. The cantilever, a kind of mechanical bridge, transmits the movements of the stylus to the cartridge components.\nCoil cartridge: There are two main types of internal generator systems, which are connected to the cantilever: moving magnet (MM) and moving coil (MC). The choice between MM and MC cartridges influences factors such cartridge weight and the overall sound profile. TheSH\u014cabove features moving coils.\nLast year,Long spoke with Resistor Magazineabout cartridges and his work. Not only is it a fascinating conversation, but it\u2019s a great primer on the wondrous device. It\u2019s also a can of worms that will make you wonder whether you need to upgrade your own cartridge.\nAsked by Resistor how people can ensure their cartridges enjoy a long life, Long replies:\nMake sure the cleaning person knows to leave the turntable alone. After that, proper set up. I assess diamond wear whenever I get a cartridge to repair that still has a diamond. About half of them are unevenly worn which leads to premature failure. Avoid liquid cleaners of any kind. The idea that liquid cleaners travel up the cantilever and corrode the suspension and coils is not a myth. I\u2019ve seen the damage. This is probably due to overuse, but still. I recommend dry Magic Eraser for cleaning.\nIn addition to these tips, one response by Long, a jack-of-all-trades mechanic who\u2019s worked on much bigger machines, stuck with us. It was in response to a question on how he got started.\nI had developed skills uniquely suited to cartridge or pickup repair. I had been challenging myself by repairing ever smaller things. Houses to cars to cameras to watches to pickups. There\u2019s a lot of crossover there, too. I make all my own tools and some of them really are basically scaled down automotive tools with which I was familiar for doing similar jobs with cartridge repair. The way I get diamonds out of a cantilever without damage is the same way you get a ball joint out of a control arm. If you\u2019re a mechanic, you know what I mean. The way I wind a coil is the same way you rewind an alternator \u2013 just on a miniature level.\nLong is on eBay, fyi, where he\u2019s a cartridge hunter-refurbisher who sells his wares."

        "title": "Stores We Love: Turntable Lab (New York)",

        "content": "If you shop for records, DJ equipment, HiFi equipment, or turntable accessories online, you\u2019ve probably spent some time on theTurntable Labwebsite. After more than 20 years, the online retailer has a global customer base who love their selection of products, and value their expertise and customer service. As a customer, I\u2019ve always been drawn to their music section that offers records you don\u2019t often see for sale on sites like Music Direct or Acoustic Sounds.\nFounderPeter Hahnis a very busy guy and constantly looking for new products for Turntable Lab\u2019s rather extensive global customer base. He\u2019s not afraid to take a flyer on some products that are TTL-branded concepts and many of them have proven to be very successful.\nBelow, Hahn explains how the company started and offers up some thoughts on the future of vinyl.\nHow did you get started and why?\nI was a working DJ in college (NYU, 90s) and kept having to buy mixers, Stanton styluses and replacement parts down on Canal Street. Coming armed with\u00a0price\u00a0research and\u00a0entering into\u00a0intense\u00a0haggling, I still ended up paying over the MSRP.\nAfter a while, I was the go-to help for other DJs who wanted to buy gear down there. I thought there had to be a better way to buy gear, so two of my college friends and I launchedturntablelab.comin my college apartment. We were one of the first DJ stores online and rode the early boom in turntablism (eg. Invisibl Skratch Piklz, X-ecutioners, DMC Battles).\nWhat were some of the biggest challenges starting and how did you overcome them?\nWe started the business when we were 21. Learning everything from scratch while bootstrapped has basically been our MO. Our first large order, which we celebrated, was fraudulent. We were calculating price margins wrong for the first couple of weeks. We had to break into the well established network of pro audio,\u00a0then HiFi. Our biggest challenge, however, has been\u00a0riding the huge market swings over the past 2 decades.\nWe\u2019re definitely in an excellent moment for vinyl right now, but we\u2019ve seen some dark days like CD supremacy, the introduction of Serato, opening a bi-coastal store at the start of the financial crisis, etc. Having to navigate those eras without macro know-how was extremely stressful and scary.\nWho is your typical customer?\nJudging by the type of records (emo-pop to esoteric) we sell and the price range of our turntables ($99 \u2013 $2,500), it\u2019s all over the place. However, we have an idea of the typical \u201cLabhead\u201d that helps guide us. A Labhead\u00a0has been following us for over 10 years; has DJ\u2019ed at one point (or still does); and collects multiple genres of records. I know a bunch of people who fit this profile and have been shopping with us close to 20 years.\nHow has Turntable Lab navigated the pandemic and what changes did you have to make in order to both navigate all of the rules in Brooklyn and keep up with demand?\nAll those challenges I mentioned before prepared us for the pandemic. I feel like in difficult business situations, it\u2019s inaction that will kill you. We took definitive action like closing the storefront early; creating and enforcing a safe workplace,\u00a0and upgrading our fulfillment to meet demand. Since the pandemic started, we\u2019ve doubled our warehouse space and doubled our shipping department. Luckily, we\u2019re located in the business-friendly Brooklyn Navy Yard. They\u2019ve been excellent in terms of balancing safety and productivity.\nWhat are some of your favorite products and why?\nHere are the items I\u2019m happiest to offer to customers:\nTechnics SL-1200MK7($999.99)\nOne of the happiest days in my life was getting my first pair of Technics (SL-1200MK2). I remember staying up all night playing with the motor and ogling\u00a0the S-shaped tonearm. I still have that pair, and have never needed any repair. We launched the business selling 1200s, so when they launched the MK7, it was like coming back full circle. Although I miss some of the visual cues of the original, the MK7 is a worthy successor.\nPro-Ject: Debut Carbon Evo($599)\nI\u2019m pretty sure Pro-Ject was our first HiFi account. We started with the Debut III in the early 2000s. As a dealer, you want consistency across models. Many manufacturers will kill a popular line or introduce new versions without much change. However with the Debut Series, the progression is very apparent. The one-piece carbon fiber tonearm was a game changer in terms of going against the OEM trend. With the Evo, I appreciate how they upgraded components they didn\u2019t necessarily have to upgrade like the feet, motor, and platter. When someone I know personally asks for a recommendation, this is usually the first model I\u2019ll recommend.\nClearaudio Concept($1,800)\nI\u2019ve been a Technics 1200 guy and I thought that would never change. There was a big mix-up in a shipment of Clearaudio turntables, and Garth (our Clearaudio distributor) ended up gifting me a Concept. That was my first high-end turntable and I was just amazed at how it would take static-y, blemished records and play them like they were mint. The way it tracked records was eye-opening.\nOrtofon 2M Blue($239)\nMy background is in design and I love to sell our customers on products that are modular. For me, the 2M Series was one of the first cartridge models that really pushed the idea of modular design. And at this price point, I also like how there\u2019s a definite noticeable upgrade in sound when you swap from Red to Blue.\nWhat do you use in your own system at home?\nI have a Technics SL-1200MK2, NAD integrated, Amphion speakers, and Line Phono Stand. I use a REVO Supersystem for listening to internet radio. Teenage Engineering OB-4 for portable listening.\nDoes it surprise you that vinyl has not only come back but become the #1 physical format again?\nNo. I was a hyper-consumer for most of my life. It\u2019s part of reason I came to live in New York. In the last\u00a05 years, I started to notice that there was less to buy for collectors like me. Bookstores were closing, toy quality was going in reverse, clothing / sneakers were pricing out. Over the last 5 years, vinyl has for the most part increased in quality while\u00a0remaining relatively affordable. There\u2019s more pressing plants doing better work.\nLabels are putting a lot of effort into packaging. Record stores are presenting the product better. Instagram is an excellent discovery tool. Discogs creates a fun, efficient market. Used record stores add the x-factor. Even colored vinyl, which was too soft / quiet pre-2010, is now very listenable.\nWhy do you prefer listening to records?\n30% = Listen to the entire album. 40% = Album artwork, liner notes, credits, label. 20% record shopping. 5% time/memory stamp. 5% ASMR.\nWhat is the most rewarding part of the job for you?\nA couple things. Now that I stopped collecting, I like to live vicariously through super-fans and collectors. For example, I tracked down the band TV Girl to do an exclusive run of their self-released album \u2018French Exit,\u2019 which was highly in-demand by fans. It was so cool to work directly with the artist and then seeing all our customers\u2019 reaction on Instagram when they received the record.\nSeeing how our team came together during this pandemic has been inspiring. There was a lot of uncertainty in the early days of the pandemic, and our warehouse crew stepped up immediately.\nLastly, running the business with one of my best friends has been especially fulfilling. After a whole work week together, we\u2019ll still meet up on a weekend with our kids.\nWhat are your 5 Desert Island Records?\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission."

        "title": "Ecoustics Selects: Audiophile Upgrades Under $300",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/audiophile-upgrades-under-300/",
        "content": "Audiophile publications have been on the receiving end of a lot of criticism over the past few years because of our focus on far too many components that most people can\u2019t afford. I would like to think that our focus on entry-level and mid-tier components and loudspeakers has positively changed the debate somewhat and I would push back and say that audiophile YouTube channels have actually done an excellent job introducing more affordable products to consumers that are actually rather good.\nThe \u201caffordability\u201d argument is a tricky one for the simple reason that everyone has a very different definition of that based on their own finances. I consider something like theBowers & Wilkins 703 S3that we justreviewedan aspirational loudspeaker option for myself at $6,000 USD. Others might view $400 loudspeakers from Wharfedale to be their ceiling \u2014 both of those are legitimate because the decision on what you want to spend is the only one that matters.\nBut are there upgrades that you can make under $300 that will pay off because the sonic performance exceeds what you might expect for the asking price? We think so.\nSome of the items are simple accessories that have made substantial differences for our staff of writers, whilst others are components that we take on the road with us or use on our desktops.\nThe little engine that could is tucked away in a suburb outside of Boston, and after almost 11 years, it is hard not to be impressed by what Ben Carter and the folks atU-Turn Audiohave accomplished.U-Turn Audiowas founded in 2012 by Benjamin Carter, Robert Hertig, and Peter Maltzan.\nHaving sold more than 120,000 turntables over that time period to a new generation of vinyl listeners and seasoned audiophiles looking for a secondary table, U-Turn Audio proved that it could be done.\nThe U-Turn Orbit was a great idea at the time, but the industry caught up and that forced them to develop necessary improvements to the existing design culminating in the the release of theOrbit Theoryin 2022.\nThe Orbit Theory was designed to compete with theRega Planar 3andPro-Ject Debut Proand at $999 falls well outside of our $300 ceiling.\nCan you get something from U-Turn Audio for $300? Indeed.\nThenew U-Turn Orbit Serieshas arrived and with new features such as a high-tech magnesium tonearm, electronic speed control, revamped drive system, and additional customization options.\nOrbit turntables incorporate modular design. This enables users to customize several turntable components such as the cartridge, preamp, speed control, platter, and isolation feet. This makes it easy for users to upgrade their turntable over time. TheOrbit Custom starts at $249and increases as options are added.\nThe new table is significantly better than the original offering much better speed stability, durability, and a superior tonearm.\nWhere to buy:$249at\u00a0uturnaudio.com\nA number of us have been listening to the standard FiiO FT3 and 32\u03a9 iteration and we have been rather surprised by the performance for under $300 USD.\nJust like theoriginal FiiO FT3, the FT3 32\u03a9 Edition is an open-back pair of headphones featuring large 60mm Dynamic Drivers, housed in an aluminum alloy shell that is both strong and lightweight, weighing in at just 391 grams.\nThe FT3 32\u03a9 model has proven to be extremely comfortable so far during its first week and the lower impedance has worked really well with an assortment ofDongle DACsanddesktop headphone amplifierson my desktop from FiiO, Schiit Audio, and Cambridge Audio.\nUnlike the standard FT3 that requires a lot of power and has an extremely neutral tonal balance and presentation (perhaps too neutral), the FT3 32\u03a9 is substantially easier to drive and is more responsive to DAC and amplifier changes. Is it an overly warm sounding headphone? Not really. But one can alter its low end thickness and tonal neutrality with a warmer sounding source.\nThe biggest surprise for us has been the soundstage width and imaging; the competition might have to go back to the drawing board in 2024 to reach this level of performance for under $300.\nBoth theFT3and FT3 32\u03a9 Edition both come supplied with a with a set of interchangeable connector plugs. Choose from 3.5mm and 6.35mm (single-ended) or 4.4mm and XLR-4 (balanced) \u2013 enabling these headphones to be enjoyed with everything fromDigital Audio Players (DAPs)and smartphones\nSupplied with 2 pairs of removable ear-pads \u2014 one pair suede, one pair leather \u2014 and a leather carry case.\nWhere to buy:$299at Audio46\nThe newC3GM bookshelf loudspeakersreplace the best-selling CG3 that were discontinued in 2022 and it\u2019s almost impossible to find a better pair of loudspeakers at the price;RSLsells all of their products direct to consumers and there is enormous value here for $210 USD/pair.\nThe C3GM work well on both stands or a desktop; the loudspeakers do not take up a lot of space (9.5\u201dH x 5.3\u2033D x 6.7\u201dW) and there is a keyhole mount for those who might wish to mount them on a wall and use them as rear channel speakers.\nThe 4-inch mineral-filled woven aramid fiber cone\u00a0woofer and 1-inch silk dome tweeter offer a fairly robust sound, but there is noticeable roll-off around 90Hz making theseideal candidate for a subwoofer.\nThe 86.5 dB (6 ohms) sensitivity is on the lower side but they will work just fine with 30-50 watts; and they certainly won\u2019t implode if you drive them with 100 to 125 watts of power either.\nA clean sounding pair of bookshelf loudspeakers with above average detail and speed considering the entry-level price tag.\nWhere to buy:$210/pair\u00a0at rslspeakers.com\nGrado does offer some rather expensive phono cartridges but the vast majority of its sales are below $300 and products like the Opus3 make one question why you need to spend a lot more; I have always believed that it makes more sense to buy a better table and use an overachieving cartridge like theGrado Labs Opus3,Denon DL-103,Nagaoka MP-110, orOrtofon 2M Bronzeinstead.\nThe Opus3 is nestled inside a Maple housing (8 grams) and I discovered that it sounded the best on my vintageYamaha YP-701and the replacement Ortofon LH-2000 Headshell that I ordered during the pandemic for another cartridge.\nThe cantilever is made from aluminum and the Opus3 uses an elliptical diamond stylus; mounting the cartridge was quite easy and I settled on a tracking force of 1.8 grams which was within the range but closer to the very top.\nGrado offers multiple versions of the Opus3 including the high output (4mV) version supplied, a low output model (1.0mV), and a mono version as well.\nThe Grado does vocals about as well as any $200 \u2013 $300 phono cartridge on the market and it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re listening to Amy Winehouse, Sarah Vaughan, Alison Moyet, Orville Peck, or Jason Isbell.\nPresence, tone, texture, and detail have to be present or it\u2019s just some flat rendition of something that doesn\u2019t engage you at all. The Grado Labs Opus3 succeeds in every way with the kind of vocals that I enjoy listening to and that makes it a keeper.\nIf your budget ceiling is $300, theGrado Labs Timbre Opus3is definitely a high-output cartridge to seriously consider.\nWhere to buy:$300at 4ourears\nHave you ever wondered where people on Instagram are getting those fantastic custom cork platter mats?\nThere\u2019s a company in New Jersey that makes them and how they got here is a bigger part of thestory.\nMost new tables come with cheap felt mats and older tables have dried up rubber mats that need to be replaced. Analog Restorations offers incredible custom cork platter mats that have ended up on thousands of platters in 2021 including 5 members of our team.

It\u2019s usually at the top end of the market where the better models fromFiiOandQuestylehave demonstrated superior dynamic capabilities, higher levels of resolution, exceptional clarity and detail retrieval, and greater power reserves.\nThat level of performance comes with a much higher price tag.\nWith the exception of a volume issue with Android, this tiny dongle elevates the sound quality of the iPhone and Android-powered smartphones by a considerable margin and at a price that has to be considered a huge bargain.\nThis one easily makes our \u201cBest of 2023\u201d list in December for its overall performance below $100.\nWhere to buy:$59at iFi Audio\nRelated video:DAP, Dongle DAC or DAC-AMP: Which should you choose?\nSumiko offers an extensive lineup of both moving coil and moving magnet cartridges; a number of models come pre-installed on Pro-Ject tables being distributed in North America and there is a lot to like about the Rainier at under $150. This 5.0mV moving magnet cartridge is in the lower tier of the range and possibly the smoothest sounding of the bunch. The Rainier has excellent channel separation and tracks exceptionally well.\nThe design enables upgrading in the future to the Moonstone or Olympia stylus. The 6.5 gram weight makes it compatible with a lot of tonearms and it\u2019s not the hardest cartridge to mount.\nWhere to buy:$149at Turntable Lab\nIs it possible for a$219 network playerto really deliver a high-end digital playback experience?\nIn the case of theWiiM Pro Plus\u2014 the better answer is that one can elevate its performance long-term with a better DAC or amplifier on the other end and you are unlikely to feel that it can be bettered without spending a lot more money.\nFor$219 USD, the WiiM Pro Plus proved to be a real surprise. Linkplay put a lot of work into the app which worked better than some apps we\u2019ve tried with more expensive streamers and that definitely has to matter.\nThe incisive presentation and pacing worked better with richer sounding systems that require some additional clarity and top end presence and that certainly makes theWiiM Pro Plusa great option for vintage systems or loudspeakers with a darker presentation.\nWhere to buy:$219at WiiM\niFi Audio is celebrating its 10th anniversary with some exciting and affordable products including this excellent phono preamplifier that offers both MM/MC inputs. The iFi ZEN Phono is part of a much larger range that includes DACs, and headphone amplifiers and we\u2019ve been super impressed with the products that we have reviewed so far.\nDon\u2019t look at the price and think that it must have some serious shortcomings. We were quite surprised by how quiet it is and that it can handle almost any cartridge on the market; the iFi ZEN Phono offers 32dB to 72dB of gain. The neutral tonal balance and clarity make it a very strong option below $200.\nThe rear panel of the chassis includes a power input, balanced output (4mm), a gain switch with four positions, two RCA input jacks, two RCA output jacks, and a grounding terminal.\nWhere to buy:$199at iFi Audio\nSome cartridges fly under the radar because the brand doesn\u2019t get them into the hands of enough members of the press or because the price doesn\u2019t create enough buzz in comparison to rivals. Goldring have been in business almost as long as Danish rival, Ortofon, and that puts them in rather elite company.\nThe Goldring E Series are natural rivals to anything Audio-Technica and Ortofon have to offer below $300 and the E4 might best them all. I\u2019ve been listening for the past month (the E4 replaced both the Ortofon 2M Red andGolding E3on myNAD table) and it\u2019s not even close.\nTheGoldring E4is designed to be compatible with all medium-to-high-mass tonearms of the type found on the\u00a0majority of budget to midrange turntables.\nWhat\u2019s different about the new E4?\nThesuper-elliptical nude diamond stylusfeatures lower effective tip mass, and improved\u00a0rigidity, which should result in better high frequency detail retrieval than \u2018bonded\u2019 elliptical alternatives.\nThe E4 features a \u2018nude\u2019 super-elliptical stylus of just 7.6 x 18 microns (0.3 x 0.7 mil), which is cut and polished from a single homogeneous piece of diamond.\nTo complement its low tip-mass stylus, the E4 now features a hollow aluminum cantilever tube.\nThe Goldring E4 delivers a more open and neutral sounding presentation with a wider soundstage. It is also easier to sculpt into a very specific type of sound which will appeal to those who use vintage receivers or amplifiers, or entry-level integrated amplifiers below $1,000 than often veer to the darker side.\nCombine all of that with excellent speed, timing, and resolution and you have one of the best soundingentry-level phono cartridgesavailable below $300.\nWhere to buy:$299at GoldringUSA.com\nFor more information: Read ourGoldring E4 Review.\nThe story of theSR80xholds a special place for not only myself, but the ears of hundreds of thousands of listeners. The first pair was built in 1991 and the SR80x is worthy of being the longest running Grado headphone.\nMy first pair of audiophile-quality headphones were the Grado Prestige SR-80s and I schlepped them around the globe for almost 5 years. They vanished during the Second Intifada in Israel when I had to evacuate a bus in the Negev out of fear that a terrorist was trying to board a bus in the area.\nMy laptop bag was unattended for hours and when I finally got it back \u2014 the headphones were gone. I hope whomever took them enjoyed them; I had another pair in my suitcase.\nOne of my complaints about thePrestige Serieswas that the cable would kink a lot and I constantly had to untangle it. The new Grado Prestige X headphones utilize anew cable designoffering more durability and flexibility. Nylon-braided sheathing that prevents kinking and twisting.\nTheGrado SR80xalso utilize the new4th generation Grado 44mm driverswhich are specifically tuned for the SR80x; this new speaker design features a more powerful magnetic circuit, a voice coil with decreased effective mass, and a reconfigured diaphragm.\nWhere to buy:$125at 4ourears\nVinyl me this\u2026vinyl me that. Who is afraid of the big, black bat?\nCouldn\u2019t resist. And nor should some of you when it comes to the Andover Audio SpinStage Phono Preamplifier.\nTheAndover Audio SpinStagehas two key features not commonly found in budget phono preamplifiers. First, by\u00a0adding a separate MC gain stage with ultra-low-noise discrete transistors in a type of transconductance topology usually found only in more expensive designs, the SpinStage benefits from providing the necessary gain without added noise.\nSecond, the addition of an Auxiliary input restores the input used by the SpinStage when it\u2019s connected to an amplifier that has only a few inputs. For example, a system that includes a CD player or other device may need the input used by the SpinStage.\nThe MM section adds 40dB of gain, whilst the MC section offers 66.5dB for low output moving coil cartridges.\nPhono-cartridge resistive and capacitive loading optimize the SpinStage\u2019s high-frequency performance with any MM cartridge, while its ultra-high-precision resistors and capacitors deliver RIAA response typically accurate within \u00b10.2dB.\nThe SpinStage\u2019s selectable subsonic filter reduces the ultra-low-frequency noise of turntable rumble that can cause excess woofer pumping and waste amplifier power.\nYou can read myreview here, but let\u2019s cut to the chase.\nBetween the loading options, build quality, and surprisingly transparent and detailed presentation, Andover Audio has created one of the best affordable phono pre-amplifiers on the market. The bass could certainly have more impact and the DIP switches might be hard for some to read, but the performance for under $250 is excellent.\nWhere to buy:$249at andoveraudio.com\nIf you spend a lot of hours at your desk working all day, there is a strong possibility that you listen to music using headphones. You may even spend some of your lunch hour gaming to break up the monotony of the daily grind.\nThe DAC/headphone amplifier in your computer is not very good and why settle for less when you can significantly upgrade the sound quality with a hub like the Schiit Audio Hel+.\nThe newHel+is an upgrade over theHel 2which was introduced in 2021; The Hel 2 added more inputs and outputs for console users, and included a unique A-to-D mic to facilitate call taking on the computer or console while listening to music or gaming.\nAside from mic inputs, a USB interface, the Hel+ offers 1.5 watts of power (32 ohms) and an optical input. The front knob controls mic gain, with the larger knob on the top panel serving as the control for headphone volume levels.\nIt is a very clean looking hub that will let gamers like my son communicate more clearly with other gamers and also hear every last creeping opponent and incoming burst of gunfire with far greater detail and impact.\nWhere to buy:$199at schiit.com\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission."

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/technics-sl-1200gr2/",
        "content": "The turntable category continues to be a source of strong sales for Technics and strong motivator in regard to development of future models. The new SL-1200GR2 and SL-1210GR2 will not be available until December, but we expect these to sell out like their predecessors.\nReleased originally in 1972, theSL-1200featured a direct drive, high-torque motor, and has been used by millions across the globe to spin records, scratch, and DJ live music for almost 5 decades.\nTechnics has updated the SL-1200 more than a few times over the past decade including theSL-1200MK7PSand other variations.\nThat table featured the same direct-drive motor of theSL-1500Cwhich was designed to avoid issues such as clogging and speed control, plus a version of the company\u2019s long-running S-shaped aluminum tonearm.\nDo the new iterations feature mere cosmetic changes or has something really changed under the hood?\nTechnics has introduced\u00a0the\u00a0SL-1200GR2/SL-1210GR2, the\u00a0next\u00a0generation of the brand\u2019s Direct-Drive Turntable System.\u00a0This new model features a new drive control technique for smooth,\u00a0accurate\u00a0rotational stability and a new power supply for an exceptionally low noise floor.\nThe new models do not come equipped with a phono cartridge.\nInterestingly, Technics looked at how they have improved signal precision in their digital audio components, especially the reference amplifier SU-R1000, which optimizes vinyl analogue signals using complex digital technology. The goal was to advance their direct drive technology and integrate it into a new generation of turntables.\nHow did they do it?\nThis was achieved by reducing motor vibration through optimising the driving sine waves via the PWM signal generation using \u0394\u03a3 (Delta Sigma) Modulation, as employed in their full-digital amplifiers.\nThe motor control signal for the new SL-1200GR2/SL-1210GR2 is a huge leap in performance in comparison with earlier versions. Looking back to the 1970s, the motor control sine wave signal was generated by an analogue RF oscillator, the precision of which left room for smoother rotation.\nAfter the revival of the Technics SL-1200 turntable in 2016, the new SL-1200GAE \u2013 along with the much-improved motor by an iron-coreless stator \u2013 inherited a new motor control based on PWM for D/A conversion, using a micro controller including a sine-wave ROM.\nThis added remarkable impact on the whole rotational precision and helped achieving lower motor vibrations. However, despite this approach, the sine wave for motor control was still not 100% accurate.\nAlong with the motor control, the general power supply has also been the focus of engineering.\nThe new Multi-stage Silent Power Supply of the SL-1200GR2/SL-1210GR2 is a combination of a low-noise, high-speed power supply working at over 100kHz and a noise canceling circuit inherited from our reference class turntable SL-1000R, cancelling remaining noise by injecting the reversed-phase current of the actual noise.\nBy this method, a very low noise floor is achieved, enabling improved signal-to-noise ratio, improving the overall signal performance.\nMost of the mechanical design of the new GR2 type has been retained from its predecessor: Kept were the rather inert 2-layered bottom chassis made of aluminum and BMC (Bulk Moulding Compound), the combination of which enables high resistance against vibrations, the 2-layered platter made of aluminum and dampened by heavy-weight rubber, the high-sensitivity S-shaped aluminum tonearm and the effective insulator feet.\nThe\u00a0newly upgraded\u00a0turntable\u00a0is equipped with standout\u00a0audio and design\u00a0features,\u00a0including:\nThe Technics Direct-Drive Turntable System SL-1200GR2 (silver) and SL-1210GR2 (black) will be available at authorized Technics retailers\u00a0in\u00a0December\u00a02023 for$2,199.99.\nFor more information:technics.com\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission."

        "content": "The little engine that could is tucked away in a suburb outside of Boston, and after almost 11 years, it is hard not to be impressed by what Ben Carter and the folks atU-Turn Audiohave accomplished.U-Turn Audiowas founded in 2012 by Benjamin Carter, Robert Hertig, and Peter Maltzan.\nNortheastern University was the setting for a rather bold concept \u2014 could a start-up focused on building affordable turntables in the United States compete with Rega, Pro-Ject, and Audio-Technica?\nHaving sold more than 120,000 turntables over that time period to a new generation of vinyl listeners and seasoned audiophiles looking for a secondary table, U-Turn Audio proved that it could be done.\nThe U-Turn Orbit was a great idea at the time, but the industry caught up and that forced them to develop necessary improvements to the existing design culminating in the the release of theOrbit Theoryin 2022.\nThose improvements came with a rather steep uptick in price \u2014 the new table sells for $999 USD.\nConvincing your base to upgrade from $300 to $1,000 might be easier for a brand like Rega that also offers amplifiers, digital sources, and phono pre-amplifiers in the same price range, but it has always felt like a stretch for U-Turn.\nThe affordability of the Orbit was the key to its success and many of us wondered when the technology developed for the Orbit Theory would start to trickle down.\nThenew U-Turn Orbit Serieshas arrived and with new features such as a high-tech magnesium tonearm, electronic speed control, revamped drive system, and additional customization options.\nThe new Orbit line consists of four models:\nFrom Bob Hertig, U-Turn Audio co-founder and Orbit designer:\u00a0 \u201cOur mission is to make great analog audio more accessible,\u2026Over the last decade, we\u2019ve built and shipped hundreds of thousands of Orbits across North America and have earned a reputation for high-level performance and quality craftsmanship that doesn\u2019t break the bank. This new generation of Orbit represents a decade of experience, learning, and turntable development. We were able to take something that was already great and make it even better.\u201d\nOrbit turntables incorporate modular design. This enables users to customize several turntable components such as the cartridge, preamp, speed control, platter, and isolation feet. This makes it easy for users to upgrade their turntable over time. TheOrbit Custom starts at $249and increases as options are added.\nOA3 Tonearm: Included with all-new Orbit turntables, the OA3 tonearm is a single-piece magnesium arm tube that tracks records precisely with very little record wear, delivering a high level of musical detail. An adjustable counterweight and internal anti-skate are included.\nElectronic Speed Control: Orbit\u2019s new electronic speed control allows users to change between 33/45 RPM playing speeds with the turn of a knob. This option is available on the Orbit Special and Custom.\nRevamped Drive System: Orbit\u2019s new grooved platter designs, combined with an all-new seamless silicone belt, provides stable operation at the chosen speed.\nNew Colors and Hardwood Options: Orbit comes in a choice of five stunning colors and two hardwood options.

        "content": "If you\u2019ve never spent any time on HiFiShark while searching for used or vintage audio equipment, I suggest that you prepare yourself for what you might find. Chaos and a lot of disappointment when theexactamplifier you have been looking for appears but the owner is in Croatia. Hard pass on that one. I love Croatia as a country and go there on vacation every few years but I\u2019m not dropping $1,500 on some amplifier that I can\u2019t visually inspect; I\u2019m willing to drive 8-10 hours each way for something really special, but I\u2019ve had too many items not show up or arrive broken in pieces to do that again.\nOne of the most obvious pitfalls of any piece of vintage audio equipment is the availability of parts and someone qualified to fix or upgrade it. I\u2019m hesitant to recommend specific components if neither one of those scenarios is a possibility. Does it make sense to recommend the Aragon 4004 MKII or Audible Illusions Modulus 3A?\nIn my previous two installments, we recommended theVandersteen 1CiandMartinLogan reQuestloudspeakers because both brands still exist, offer comprehensive service and parts, and there is a lot of demand for both on the used/vintage audio markets. Both companies have been around for almost 40 years and are very successful.\nTheAragon 4004 MKIIhas not been in production for a few decades but the current ownership atIndy Audio Labsare superb audio engineers and doing a great job presently with Aragon and Acurus. Based on my experience, they are there to help Aragon 4004 MKII owners.\nWe recentlyreviewed the Acurus Muse A/V Processorand it\u2019s one of the best home theater products available; an aspirational piece of equipment for those of us who love watching movies in a dedicated home theater room.\nAudible Illusionsis also still in business and manufacturing high-end pre-amplifiers and power amplifiers. The brand flew under the radar for many years but has recently relocated from its factory in California to a new \u201cstate-of-the-art\u201d facility in Ormond Beach, Florida.\nThe company offers a completely new version of its famedModulus 3A pre-amplifiercalled the Modulus 3B. The prices have certainly increased over the past 20 years with the new model retailing for $5,400 USD.\nAudible Illusions also offers new tube sets for the Modulus 3A and service/repairs for a fee. I would highly recommend sticking with their parts and recommended tube sets based on hours of online research on various forums.\nSo why are we talking about these two specificvintage audio componentsthat will run you at least $2,500 on the used market?\nNew York Magazineran avery famous coverin 1990 featuring Mike Kay, the owner of Lyric Hi Fi and Video; the New York high-end audio institution closed permanently during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMike Kay passed away in 2012 leaving behind a very important legacy. Not only was Lyric Hi Fi one of the most influential stereo shops in the world launching many of the brands that have graced the covers of stereo magazines for decades, but it created a very high standard for the retailers that would emerge across the United States.\nThe Absolute Soundwould not exist had Mike Kay not convinced the late-Harry Pearson to launch his publication.\nI was 20 when I saw that cover on the newsstand in a bookstore in Dupont Circle and its impact on the rest of my life was not something that I was expecting.\nI remember flipping through the David Denby article and focusing on the stack of Aragon, Audible Illusions, California Audio Labs, andVPIcomponents.\nNone of this equipment was easy for me to find in Toronto or D.C. where I lived at the time, so I hopped on the train and made my way to New York City to visit Lyric and Sound by Singer.\nTheNew York Magazinearticle mentioned the more affordable Aragon 2004 and Audible Illusions Modulus 2B but my interest in the two brands was ignited.\nAndrew Singer standing behind a pair of MartinLogan CLS was like a drug for me. I wouldn\u2019t stop until I owned the speakers. 31 years have gone by and I\u2019m looking for my 6th pair of MartinLogan speakers \u2014 which will definitely be my last.\nThe bipolar side of my personality became obsessed with high-end audio equipment and my desire to spend all of my hard-earned money from 4 years of working 60 hours a week during the summer at my parent\u2019s pizzeria became a red flag for my family. Especially when I was attending a $30,000 per year college (1990) in a foreign country.\nThe Aragon 4004 MKII power amplifier was created by Mondial Designs; the short-lived design house owned by Dan D\u2019Agostino of Krell. The 4004 quickly became known as the \u201cpoor man\u2019s Krell\u201d for its bottomless pit of power and similar tonal balance. It was a heavy chunk of metal with a unique ventilation design and heatsinks.\nThe 200 watt per channel 4004 MKII contained two separate mono amplifiers in a single chassis and could drive almost anything.\nThe amplifier could double its output into 4 ohms and was ideal for MartinLogan electrostatic loudspeakers and the Magnepan models of the period.\nFor all of its brute power, the 4004 MKII could sound remarkably transparent and detailed with the right pre-amplifier and speakers.\nThe Modulus 3A was introduced in 1995 or 1996 and for a smaller brand, they were able to move a lot of product back in the day. Audible Illusions sold more than 15,000 all-tube pre-amplifiers during its first 15 years in business which is a lot for any high-end brand in 2021.\nThe Modulus didn\u2019t become very popular in the US until 1984 or 1985 and it took a series of very positive reviews before the brand began to get noticed by the high-end crowd in America.\nAudible Illusions was started by Art Ferris, a successful exporter of vintage McIntosh and Marantz gear to salivating customers in Asia. When the supply began to dwindle, he created the brand to satisfy the demand for American-made tube gear in Japan.\nFast foward to 1996 and the Modulus 3A was in heavy demand. The optional John Curl-designed MC phono stage was an option that many selected and was well worth the extra $500. If you\u2019re a fan ofParasound, you\u2019re very likely aware of John Curl\u2019s products.\nThe Modulus 3A\u2019s faceplate was a very substantial piece of metal that was 1/4\u2033 thick. The 4 control knobs were beautifully machined from aluminum. The ventilated top cover was secured with nicely finished hex-headed screws and easy to remove; something that was necessary to deal with the tubes that often blew well before their time.\nThe line stage portion of the Modulus 3A was excellent but the phono stage was on another level for a tube pre-amplifier in 1996 priced at $1,895. Definitely not inexpensive but it could compete with some of the best products of the period and was very well engineered.\nIf you\u2019re obsessed with measurements, the Audible Illusions Modulus 3A was near the top of the mountain for a pre-amplifier at the time. The power supply was housed in a separate chassis connected to the main unit with an umbilical cord.\nWhy should you bother trying to assemble a vintage system around these two components?\nSynergy.\nThe concept has not changed and putting these two excellent components together with the right pair of loudspeakers created an excellent stereo system in 1996 and would work just as well in 2021.\nThe Aragon 4004 MKII needs the warmth and resolution of the Modulus 3A and any of the pre-amplifier\u2019s shortcomings in the low end are quickly fixed by the intense slam and control of the 4004 MKII which delivered bass notes with authority, texture, and excellent pacing.\nTwo of the best components from the period and well worth the money today if the condition is excellent.\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission."

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/the-most-significant-turntables/",
        "content": "Almost 145 years have elapsed since Edison\u2019s Phonograph was patented.\nSince then, which turntables were truly significant? What technical capabilities and design features did they introduce?\nWe could easily publish a list of the \u201cbest\u201d turntables available right now but 99% of the planet could never afford them and will never have the opportunity to listen to one. This feels like a more interesting discussion.\nWe\u2019ve included some tables from the late 1900s and the first part of the 20th century because they were indeed, very significant\u2026\nThe Edison Phonograph, invented by Thomas Edison in 1877, is considered the earliest form of recorded sound playback. It used a cylindrical wax cylinder and a hand-cranked mechanism, laying the foundation for future turntable designs.\nIntroduced in 1906 by the Victor Talking Machine Company, this turntable became an iconic symbol of the early 20th century American music industry. It used a spring-driven motor to rotate a flat disc, and its signature \u201cHis Master\u2019s Voice\u201d logo became an enduring symbol of high-quality audio.\nThe Philips 212 Electronic, introduced in 1965, was one of the first commercially successful turntables to feature an electronic speed control mechanism. It marked a shift from manual speed adjustment to accurate electronic speed regulation, setting a precedent for future turntable designs.\nThe Garrard 301, introduced in 1954, was a breakthrough turntable known for its innovative idler-wheel drive system. It offered superior speed stability and became a benchmark for audio quality, influencing turntable design for years to come.\nIntroduced in 1961, the AR XA was only $58 and what made it unique was how it handled vibration and how low its rumble measured. The package did not come with a cartridge but the price included the table, tonearm, stylus gauge, and dustcover.\nThe most interesting aspect of the design was its mounting system; Edgar Villchur realized that instead of attaching the motor, tonearm, and lightweight platter to the table\u2019s top plate, it made more sense to mount the platter and tonearm to a sub platform which was suspended underneath the top plate at 3 very distinct points with damped springs with a low resonant frequency.\nBy doing so, the tonearm and record were isolated from footfalls and other acoustic vibration. Thorens and Linn would incorporate these concepts into their future tables.\nIn 1965, the Thorens TD 150, an inconspicuous little turntable, came on the market and thus started a technical revolution in record player manufacturing. For the first time, a spring-suspended sub-chassis with an inner platter driven by a flat belt was used in a mass-produced unit. The principle proved to be very successful and found many imitators in the years since.\nThe Thorens TD-124, released in the late 1950s, is highly regarded for its engineering excellence and advanced features. It featured a heavyweight platter, idler drive, a unique floating suspension, and a durable build, setting new standards for turntable performance and reliability.\nThe Technics SP-10, introduced in 1970, was a groundbreaking direct-drive turntable known for its exceptional speed stability and accuracy. It became popular among professional audio engineers and studios, setting a benchmark for precision playback.\nThe Linn LP12, introduced in 1972, played a crucial role in the resurgence of vinyl and the growth of the high-end audio market. It featured innovative suspension and vibration isolation techniques, setting new standards for turntable design and sound quality.\nThe Technics SL-1200, launched in 1972, is one of the most significant turntables in history. It revolutionized DJ culture and became the industry standard for its direct-drive system, rugged build quality, and precise pitch control.\nThe Rega Planar 3, first introduced in the 1970s and continuously refined over the years, became a symbol of simplicity, affordability, and excellent sound quality. It made high-quality audio accessible to a broader audience and became a popular choice among vinyl enthusiasts.\nThe Dual 1219, released in the 1970s, was one of the first turntables to incorporate automatic features such as auto-start, auto-stop, and automatic tonearm return. It introduced convenience and automation to the turntable market, shaping the future of consumer audio.\nThe Pro-Ject Debut Carbon, introduced in the late -1990s, played a crucial role in making high-quality turntables more affordable and accessible. It offered impressive sound quality and build quality at a budget-friendly price, attracting a new generation of vinyl enthusiasts."

        "content": "Planar magnetic headphoneshave been the tip of the spear during the Head-Fi revolution and you are more likely to find consumers who have heard of the technology because of the exponential growth of the high-end headphone market versus those who have experienced planar or ribbon loudspeakers.\nEdward W. Kellogg and Chester W. Rice are credited with inventing the first ribbon loudspeaker while they were working at General Electric in 1924. They discovered that a thin metal ribbon suspended in a magnetic field could be used to produce sound waves, and this design has been refined and improved upon over the decades.\nDr. Oskar Heil was also a pioneer when it comes to ribbon loudspeakers in the 1930s. Heil was a German physicist and inventor who was interested in developing new types of loudspeakers that could produce high-quality sound across a wide frequency range. Heil\u2019s design used a thin strip of metal foil suspended in a magnetic field to produce sound.\nThe ribbon loudspeaker was initially used in military and industrial applications, but it later became popular in high-end audio systems due to its ability to reproduce sound with exceptional clarity and detail.\nAudiophiles have enjoyed the benefits of planar/ribbon loudspeakers for almost 50 years, and many of us have owned loudspeakers created byMagnepan, Eminent Technology, Infinity, andApogee Acoustics. New brands likeDiptyqueandClarisys Audioare offering new ribbon designs that offer even more impressive performance.\nRibbon tweeters have become extremely common and one can find them in loudspeakers manufactured by Quad,MartinLogan, Adam Audio, Emotiva, Aperion, andMonoprice.\nLike other planar loudspeakers (electrostatic), planar magnetic loudspeakers use a flat diaphragm to produce sound. However, instead of using an electrostatic charge to move the diaphragm, planar magnetic drivers use a magnetic field.\nThe diaphragm is suspended between two rows of magnets, and when an electrical signal is applied to the voice coil, it interacts with the magnetic field to move the diaphragm and produce sound.\nThe diaphragm is usually made of a thin film or foil material, such as Mylar or Kapton, and is mounted between two sets of magnets, one on either side of the diaphragm.\nPlanar magnetic drivers are known for their ability to produce accurate, detailed sound with low distortion. They can reveal subtle nuances in music and reproduce complex sounds with clarity.\nWhen an electrical signal is applied to the conductive trace pattern, a magnetic field is created that interacts with the magnets and causes the diaphragm to move, producing sound waves. The movement of the diaphragm is much more precise and controlled than in traditional cone drivers, which can lead to improved clarity and detail in the sound.\nPlanar magnetic loudspeakers are known for their ability to produce very accurate, detailed sound with low distortion.\nRibbon and planar magnetic loudspeakers also features a dipole radiation pattern, which means that the sound is radiated equally from both the front and the back of the speakers. This results in a more spacious and natural soundstage, as the sound is not confined to a single direction.\nHowever, they can be more expensive to manufacture than traditional cone drivers, and they may require more power to drive than other types of loudspeakers. Additionally, planar magnetic loudspeakers can be quite large and heavy, which can make them difficult to install in some environments.\nPlanar magnetic loudspeakers offer several advantages over other types of loudspeakers:\nWhile planar magnetic loudspeakers offer several advantages, they also have some disadvantages to consider, including:\nOverall, planar magnetic loudspeakers are a specialized type of loudspeaker that can offer superior sound quality in certain applications, but they may not be the best choice for every listener or environment.\nIt\u2019s important to consider the specific needs and requirements of your audio system when deciding whether to invest in planar magnetic loudspeakers.\nHere is a list of some ribbon/planar loudspeakers or models that utilize a ribbon driver technology.\nNote that this is not an exhaustive list and there are many other ribbon loudspeakers available from various manufacturers.\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission."

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/quadraphonic-rhino-kevin-milligan/",
        "content": "Over the past five years, a growing number of specialized labels or sublabels have cropped up whose mission is to produce limited-run, no-expense-spared represses of classic albums. Created for audio obsessives whose quest for perfect vinyl copies of their favorite records has less to do with original pressings than with optimal sound, labels like Music Matters, Acoustic Sounds, and Electric Recording Company seem to have taken cues from the art and book collectors\u2019 markets, where rarity and quality combine to create bliss (and value). The Tone Poet/Blue Note Classic series, Acoustic Sounds/Impulse/Verve series, Craft\u2019s Original Jazz Classics reboot are a few examples of such endeavors.\nA few months ago Rhino, the archival arm of Warner Music, issued the first two records from its new Rhino High Fidelity imprint. Devoted to producing remarkable albums from Warner\u2019s massive trove of recordings, Rhino High Fidelity\u2019s initial releases are at opposite ends of the musical spectrum: John Coltrane\u2019sColtrane\u2019s SoundandThe Cars, the debut album by the Boston new wave band. \u201cThese high-end, limited-edition vinyl reissues of classic albums represent the pinnacle of sound and packaging,\u201d boasts the label on its website.\nThe curatorial driver of Rhino High Fidelity is Rhino senior director of A&R\u00a0Patrick Milligan, who took time to hop on a call to discuss the imprint. Too, Milligan talked about Rhino\u2019s new Quadio initiative, which has been mining the Warner archives for recordings, mostly from the 1970s, released in quadraphonic (four-channel) sound. The below conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing: What was the reasoning behind the launch of Rhino High Fidelity?\nPatrick Milligan: Rhino Hi-Fi came about because we\u2019ve obviously licensed material over the years to Mobile Fidelity, Acoustic Sounds, Electric in the UK \u2013 they do these $300, limited to 300-copies kind of things. We\u2019ve never really done that, and we thought we should maybe try to get in that lane.\nIt was first suggested to me that we consider doing half-speed masters, and I\u2019ve always been a little bit ambivalent about that because a lot of mastering people I talked to feel like you take a tape and you\u2019ve got something at a low frequency that reproduces at normal speed, but when you slow it down to half-speed, those low frequencies don\u2019t reproduce so you lose low and you probably gain some detail in other areas.\nBut when I found out that the current process of half-speed mastering is digital, I just didn\u2019t want to go that route. So we decided, \u201cWe\u2019ll amplify what it is that makes the good records that we do great\u201d \u2013\u00a0 like mastering and cutting lacquers from original analog tapes, and using Kevin Gray, who I think is one of the few mastering engineers that everybody seems to know because his work is so respected, and people are anxious to get anything that he\u2019s cut.\nWe do other albums and we typically cut from tape when we can, so it\u2019s not like we don\u2019t do that in other projects. And we do use Kevin on other projects, too. But for this, we just thought, \u201cWell, what if we control every aspect of this to be the highest quality \u2013 use the tapes, use Kevin Gray, and we press these at Optimal?\u201d\nWhy Optimal?\nI know people are very opinionated about pressing plants, and we use a variety of pressing plants. I think we all feel like Optimal is certainly the most consistent, really quiet, clean, pressings. They just get it. It\u2019s in Germany. There are US plants that are very revered and probably equally as good, but Bernie Grundman has told me several times he thinks that Optimal is the best pressing plant. I know Kevin Gray had mentioned that, certainly in terms of European pressing plants, Optimal is pretty much top of the game. So for us, it\u2019s a consistency thing. And I think it shows in these records. We\u2019re doing 180-gram and we decided that we were going to elevate the packaging to be as nice as it could be. They\u2019re super heavyweight, tip-on, glossy, gatefold jackets.\nYeah, they make this satisfying cracking sound when you open the gatefold for the first time.\nExactly, yes. Very old school. We\u2019re reproducing all the original artwork. Not to get too geeky, but in the case ofThe Cars, since there was an inner sleeve in the original record, we made that the gatefold art since the original album was a single album. And for Coltrane, which also was not originally a gatefold, we got a really beautiful photo that was used as a promo photo for Atlantic in the day.\nThat's a great photo.\nYeah, yeah, it\u2019s fun to find ways to make the packaging as nice as we can. Another thing I\u2019m particularly proud of because I\u2019m a real tape- and a tape-box-geek, we were like, \u201cLet\u2019s add an insert and reproduce the tape box so people can see the actual tape that this record was cut from,\u201d so you kind of have your own copy of the tape, in a way. Inside the insert, we\u2019ve got notes for each of these release \u2013 notes that are from somebody involved in the actual sessions talking about an aspect of making the record.\n\u201cWith Quad, it\u2019s psycho acoustics\u2026 You can put something acoustically centered in almost a 3D way, because you\u2019ve got that soundscape sense.\u201d\nFor the Coltrane record, literally everybody involved in that session is no longer with us. But we were fortunate enough to have had producer Tom Dowd write a little bit about the Coltrane sessions for us when we did the Atlantic CD box. It\u2019s a nice piece. He really describes what it was like to edit an Atlantic Coltrane session, how Coltane would come in and simply play for a long time before everybody else showed up to establish the mood of the session.\nThe goal is presenting somebody an opportunity to get inside the making of the record and what makes these records sound so great. Hopefully that\u2019s a nice add-on for people, too. I\u2019m super proud of how they turned out, and I\u2019m also really thrilled with the response that we\u2019ve gotten. It\u2019s been all very positive, and we\u2019ve already sold out ofThe Cars. That took us all by surprise.\nThey're beautiful sets and they sound amazing.\nThank you. When you get in the hi-fi lane, that\u2019s a critical audience. If it didn\u2019t turn out great, it could really blow up in your face.\nThe Cars and Coltrane are obviously two very different kinds of records. Is there any sort of connective tissue for the imprint going forward other than just awesome stuff from the Warner archives?\nWe can get creative with it. When we planned these first two, we had another title with The Cars, and we decided at the last minute to change it up because we thought well, let\u2019s have a little variance. I think the jazz audience intersects with audiophiles to some degree, and certainly some of the Blue Note albums have really resonated with that audience. So we just thought, Coltrane is certainly the gem of our jazz catalog. I had a few higher-ups at our company who asked, \u201cWhy this and notGiant StepsorMy Favorite Things? I said \u201cWe\u2019ve done versions ofGiant StepsandMy Favorite Thingsthat recently we expanded for the high fidelity lane.\u201d I just felt, \u201cLet\u2019s not do something that\u2019s been done to death.\u201d\nI\u2019m a big Coltrane fan, and I\u2019ve always really lovedColtrane\u2019s Sound. I think that because it came out after he left Atlantic, people maybe think it is not a real record, but it is basically from sessions from the same time. I\u2019ve talked to several people that feel the same way. It\u2019s like, \u201cEquinox,\u201d that\u2019s one of the best Coltrane songs ever. So I\u2019m glad that a lot of people got that. This is a record that needs to be championed. It gets overlooked and it\u2019s great sounding.\nKevin Gray is in high demand and super busy and it\u2019s tough to schedule time with him sometimes. But I called him on Thursday, and I said, \u201cHey, any chance you could cut a Coltrane record for me by Tuesday?\u201d He said yeah, he knew the tape. He told me later, \u201cYou know, I did that because it was Coltrane.\u201d I said, \u201cYeah, it was kind of counting on that.\u201d\nYou've got Ornette Coleman's catalog too, right?\nWe do.\nThere you go. Good.\nWe\u2019ll just leave it at that. [Laughs.]\nI'm looking at that beautiful Coleman CD box right now in my office that Atlantic put out, Beauty is a Rare Thing.\nYeah, I worked on that project. When we did the Atlantic jazz catalog, I worked really closely with Joel Dorn when we first launched. It was really fun to work with him, but that particular Ornette Coleman set was a passion project, and a cool one for people there at Atlantic.\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping with Rhino High Fidelity that people will take a chance on something. Like, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t really know this record, but if it\u2019s in this format it\u2019s probably going to be fun to hear.'\u201d\nHonestly, I don\u2019t know much about Rhino\u2019s new Quadio initiative. I was thinking it was along the lines of Dolby Atmos, but it\u2019s focused on quadraphonically recorded albums.What's Quadio?\nQuad was four speakers, two front and two rear. If you have a home theater system, it basically puts two in front and two in rear, just like Quad would be.\nIt\u2019s interesting you mentioned Atmos. We\u2019ve gone through several eras and different kinds of immersive audio. As you probably recall, in the early 2000s the SACD and 5.1 immersive audio never really resonated and took off. But if you hear stuff in the format, it can be very impressive. I think it\u2019s always been difficult to communicate to consumers just exactly what it is. Certainly audiophiles or people more in-the-know who might have invested in those systems love it. But like I always said about 5.1 when they were really pushing it, we\u2019re entering into an era when people are getting iPods and little headphones. They\u2019re not sitting in a sweet spot in a room listening to a home theater system. And I have a home theater system and I had a 5.1 system and some of that stuff is incredible. If you\u2019ve heard it, it\u2019s really beautiful.\nAtmos has a little bit better chance because it\u2019s been adopted by Apple and Tidal and people like that. For Apple, it\u2019s very much about hearing it in headphones. If you really get to hear Atmos in a room that\u2019s Atmos equipped, it\u2019s impressive. Atmos Dolby has a Theater in Hollywood where they do demos \u2013 it\u2019s a small movie theater, basically. And it has I don\u2019t know how many \u2013 48 or 60 \u2013 speakers all the way around like a movie theater. Then to go into a studio that\u2019s Atmos-equipped is also super impressive. Most people don\u2019t get that opportunity. With Quad [quadraphonic sound] there seems to be a really fierce fan base of original Quad records and several websites and databases and things like that.\nSo all of the releases are from that same Quadraphonic era of the 1970s?\nYeah, Quad became a format basically from 1971 to 1976, and I can tell you two that there were things that were mixed in the format that didn\u2019t end up getting released. We have some of that stuff in the library and we may end up doing some of that at some point. But it\u2019s authentic to the original format.\nWe have it set up in the office and I\u2019m telling you, I\u2019ve heard these amazing Atmos mixes \u2013 Atmos is really spatial because if you mix, it\u2019s object-based so you can move things around in a pretty amazing 3D atmosphere. And because there are speakers up top and on the side, you can move sounds around. With Quad, it\u2019s psycho acoustics. Like with stereo, you\u2019ve got left and right and then you\u2019ve got something in the middle when you combine the two. That applies to Quad, too. You can put something acoustically centered in almost a 3D way, because you\u2019ve got that soundscape sense.\nSteve Woolard, one of my A&R colleagues at Rhino, is an audio enthusiast and he\u2019s always been kind of a Quad fanatic. And over the years Rhino has tried a few different things. When Rhino Handmade was still going, there was a greatest hits album of Aretha Franklin\u2019s that was only ever Quad released. It had some unique versions of songs and stuff like that. They put that out but it really didn\u2019t do that well. A few other things were done \u2013 The DoorsBest ofthat Bruce Botnick mixed in Quad back in the day was included on a Blu-ray.\nThe other significant things were that Steve realized that the band Chicago had their first nine albums \u2013 other than the live album \u2013 all in Quad, which is by far the most Quad albums any artist ever had. He put together a box that calledQuadioand it\u2019s all of those albums on Blu-ray in a beautiful box that all reproduced exactly as the original albums were, with the posters and the embossed covers and things like that and it\u2019s really beautiful. They did a run of that just to try it and it sold through almost immediately. So they did another one and it sold through.\nThen, just around the time I came back to Rhino at the end of 2018, we did the Doobie Brothers that way \u2013 they had four albums in Quad \u2013 so we did a Quad box and that sold through. It occurred to me that like this Quad thing really resonates, at least on our website where we can sell direct to consumers. People seem to know about these and follow the Quad sites and immersive sites. So I suggested that we consider doing some individual titles and start a series.\nThose just came out, right?\nWe just launched the first four, Black Sabbath,Paranoid, Alice Cooper\u2019sBillion Dollar Babies, J. Geils\u2019Nightmares and Other Tales\u2026, and Jefferson Starship\u2019sRed Octopus. We did those all individually and the response has been unbelievable. I think people are a fan of the format and it\u2019s a little bit like the high-fidelity thing. It caters to an audiophile and I think there are a lot of people that are fans of the format. I\u2019m hoping with Rhino High Fidelity that people will take a chance on something. Like, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t really know this record, but if it\u2019s in this format it\u2019s probably going to be fun to hear.\u201d"

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/vintage-cd-player/",
        "content": "For decades, the main format-facing argument between analog freaks and their CD-loving counterparts revolved around the sound quality, analog warmth, and soulful essence of vinyl vs. the clean, crisp clarity of digital discs.\nLong a polarizing either/or beef, it seems pretty obvious at this point that listening tastes and personal preferences can be just as important as quantitative, provable data. As such, over the past few years the bickering among physical format enthusiasts has begun to recede. Vinyl rules. Cassettes rule. And, honestly, if the obviously imperfect cassette format can rule, then why can\u2019t CDs rule alongside them both?\nThose looking for 1990s rarities, after all, don\u2019t have much of a choice when it comes to format: it\u2019s either disc or nothing, as many labels stopped making vinyl during the decade and a lot of great music has yet to land on streaming services.\nIf it seems as though we\u2019re qualifying our devotion to vinyl, you need to find more space in your heart. Propelling magical sound waves into the air is the goal.The warmth resides within.\nAll of this is a roundabout way of getting to this point: CD players are an incredibly useful component to add to your arsenal, and since 95% of those who owned a CD player during the format\u2019s heyday got rid of theirs, the market is dense with quality players \u2014 at least for now. It\u2019s a similar environment as the pre-vinyl-revival era of the 1990s. The same goes for CDs themselves: used copies remain cheap but prices are started to rise. They will continue to do so.\nBelow, some favorites.\nWhat Marantz says about the iconic player, originally manufactured in 1982:\nReleased in the fall of 1982, the original Marantz Model CD-63 was one of the first mass-adopted CD players in the marketplace \u2014 and its details and craftmanship are cherished and reverberate throughout audio equipment to this day. According to historian and aficionado @MarantzHistory, \u201cthe CD-63 screams the 1980s.\u201d\nWith its top-loading design and signature champagne color, the CD-63 immediately stood out for its refined appearance and unmatched performance. Features of the CD-63 are engraved on the player, including a paragraph on the advantages of digital sound. Its display includes 15 LED lights, one per track on most CDs. If the CD had more tracks, skipping was impossible.\nOne audio expert of the day had this to say about the Harman/Kardon HD760, which he called \u201ca very good sounding player, 3D soundstage with 24 bits HDCD and 4\u00d720 bits converters for a clear sound with voices and every kind of music.\u201d Describing it as \u201cvery jitter free and quick responding as you skip tracks,\u201d he calls it \u201cthe best sounding player [for the price] I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d The H/K has a standby function, both coax and optical outputs, and gold-plated cinch outputs. The display has a dimmer for nighttime listening.\nFound on used gear sites for between $200-$300.\nFrom the Tascam site:\nThe TASCAMCD-601mkIIis a fully-redesigned version of the radio-standard CD player. With its comprehensive remote control and flexible monitoring and playback options, the CD-601mkII goes far beyond the capabilities of traditional CD players for broadcast. The radio presenter can select between online play (on the air) and monitor play (pre-listen), controlling whether CD playback reaches the on-air mixer or the monitoring device.\nThe optionalRC-601mkIIremote control (above right) allows frame-accurate search using the jog wheel, direct location using numerical keys, index searches or flash starts. In addition, the CD-601mkII can save up to 10 cue points per CD, controlled directly using the Flash Start function. Many other features like pitch control, auto cue with five threshold levels, Auto Read and CD Text are all designed to reduce stress before the program goes on the air.\nThese players aren\u2019t too hard to find for under $200, though they don\u2019t come up as often as the brilliant Tascam CD-200, whose secret weapon is a pitch control.\nThe TikTok-famous player has found fans due to its top-loading design and transparent window, which allows you to see the disc load and spin. Currently available for under $400 on eBay, it\u2019s not that hard to find one in good condition. It\u2019s got RCA outputs so you can add it to your system. Also covetable: Anice Sony CMT-ED1\nKnown for their durable top-of-the-line cassette decks, Nakamichi invested just as much time and energy into their compact disc players during the peak CD era.\nOne audiophile describes it as having a digital-audio-converter that\u2019s \u201cone of the best in the world: the TDA1541A S1 CROWN. These chips alone go for a few hundred dollars today\u2026 It blows away most DACs and players under $1,000 and has ZERO harshness or grain, yet is extremely organic and detailed from top to bottom. The bass slam and depth is something to marvel at, as are the dynamics overall. This blew away my Denon 2560, 3520, Cambridge 640, Schiit Bifrost Uber, Nuforce UDAC, Audioquest Dragonfly, Marantz CD94 and Nakamichi OMS-7.\u201d\nEasily found for under $250.\nAs notedin a reviewon the Hi-Fi audio site Hi-Fi Classic, the Quad CD 66 was manufactured to pair with the Quad 66 preamplifier, and a remote control is required to work the CD player minus the preamp. Per Hi-Fi Classic, \u201cthe player\u2019s entire display window is the size of the preamplifier\u2019s volume/balance display, and it normally shows only the current track and index numbers and the elapsed time on the track. It also shows pause and error indications when appropriate as well as the letter p beside the track number in programmed operation. Right after a disc is loaded, the display shows its total playing time and total tracks.\u201d\nOne crucial thing to know about CD players is that their innards were manufactured by only a few corporations who, in turn, sold the same devices to whoever was building players. Which is to say, sometimes the only difference between players made by competitors is the shell and digital display.\nQuad\u2019s innards were made Philips, who introduced compact discs to the market. Per Hi-Fi Classic: \u201cThe digital portion of the player uses quadruple oversampling at 176.4 kHz along with a digital filter and dual 16-bit digital-to-analog (D/A) converters. The rear apron contains a coaxial digital output, the two analog outputs, and input/output jacks for use with an RC-5 multiroom controller. There is no power-output socket, since in a full Quad system the CD player would be at the end of the power chain.\u201d\nThese are pricier than others here: It\u2019s not easy to find one for under $800 right now.\nHere\u2019s what Stereophilehad to sayabout the Rega Planet CD upon its release in 1997:\nRega is the last major UK specialty house to produce a CD player. They are the \u201clast adopters.\u201d You know Rega\u2019s attitude toward digital when you read the poop sheet they send out to dealers and distributors: \u201cThe Planet is a small analogue oasis in a digital world and will appeal to people who love music but have to or want to listen to the CD medium.\u201d\nRega has engineered this CD player to give a sound and an operational feel close to analog. Playing discs on the $795 Rega Planet is a lot like playing LPs: You can read the CD label as the disc sits inside the player, and you can see the disc spin as it plays.\nThe Planet is a top-loader, which presents a problem if you need to squeeze your CD player into a tight space. You can\u2019t stack anything on top of the Rega Planet; you need at least 5\u2033 of clearance between the top of the player and the bottom of the next shelf. Better yet, put the Rega Planet on a top shelf. (Avoid placing the player on a veneered table or shelf; the gummy foot-suspension material could stick to the surface and lift the finish. Cut out a piece of cardboard and wedge it under each foot. Or put the player on a sheet of plate glass.)\nGrab one of these now for about $350. In five years they\u2019ll cost twice that.\nThis is not a joke.Check this Instagram.\nCommenter in post: \u201cWhat makes it great?\u201d Budget Audiophiler: \u201cThe DAC used in this model and the cost.\u201d\nEasily found for under $200.\nHere\u2019s what the respected audio reviewer Leonard Feldman had to say about this 1984 production:\nIt comes as no surprise to me that this first Compact Disc player to be built by Studer-Revox is one of the most sophisticated, rugged, yet easy-to-use units of its kind that I have ever tested. After all, Studer and Revox tape equipment is used in broadcast and recording studios throughout the world, and Revox products (the brand name used on Studer\u2019s consumer products) are regarded by many to have the same attributes as the company\u2019s professional components. What did surprise me was the suggested retail price of the unit. I had fully expected the Revox CD player to be among the world\u2019s most expensive as well as among the world\u2019s best. While it certainly lived up to the latter expectation, its price was no higher than that on some of the first-generation CD players which offered only a fraction of this unit\u2019s versatility.\nThese are skyrocketing in value. Currently going for about $700."

        "title": "McIntosh\u2019s ML1 MKII Loudspeaker Delivers Modern Sound From A Vintage Design",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/mcintosh-ml1-mkii/",
        "content": "Vintage Audiohas become a huge trend in the high-end space; loudspeaker companies including Klipsch, PSB, Mission, KLH, JBL, and Wharfedale have successfully introduced modern iterations of some of their most popular loudspeakers from the past fifty years. McIntosh is joining that list with the launch of its latest speaker, theML1 MKII.\nTheMcIntosh ML1 MKIIis a unique loudspeaker where vintage style meets contemporary sound. It\u2019s made in the USA and said to be reborn with a similar bass response as the initial version but without the need of an equalizer.\nThe ML1 MKII can be connected with amplifiers up to 600 Watts to fill the largest of rooms with life-size sound. It also featureswide dispersion, which allows for an equal distribution of sound throughout the listening area.\nThe external design of the ML1 MKII retains the same charm as the original ML1 with its oiled American Walnut solid wood cabinets and satin finish veneers. Whereas, internally, it features a full modern revamp to reflect McIntosh\u2019s present-day high performance speaker technology. The ML1 MKII is a4-way speaker that uses five separate speaker driversto produce a uniform listening area and highly resolved sound quality.\nUnlike the original ML1, the drivers on the new generation ML1 MMKII arepositioned symmetricallyso there is not a dedicated left and right speaker, eliminating the possibility of installing the speakers in the wrong orientation, and providing a more uniform listening area.\nAspecially milled transition platehouses the midranges and tweeter and allows them to be placed close together. Their close proximity to each other reduces off axis lobing of the sound field and places all the acoustic output that typically impacts imaging together in a small space. The transition plate also provides a strong foundation for the upper frequency units to reduce vibrations that might affect the sound. Internal cabinet bracing provides an airtight and separated enclosure from the 12\u2033 woofer to further minimize vibrations.\nThe upper midrange in the ML1 has low resonance and high-power handling capabilities; this allows the crossover point between the lower and upper midranges to avoid the 1kHz frequency that is critical to producing clear vocals. The crossover frequency of the tweeter reduces vertical lobing of the sound field and allows the ML1 to reproduce the recorded music more faithfully.\nWith its12\u2033 woofer, the ML1 has an incredible bass response down to 30Hz, which is close to the lowest frequency the human ear can detect. A subwoofer will typically not be needed to achieve deep, punchy bass. You might see some similarly sized speakers with more woofers, but don\u2019t be deceived by a higher woofer count as there is no substitute for woofer size. In fact, the single 12\u2033 woofer in the ML1 has the same surface area as four 6\u2033 woofers \u2013 and when it comes to the bass frequencies that a woofer produces, the larger the surface area the better to push all that air.\nThe 12\u2033 woofer has been designed to work in anacoustic suspension design enclosure, just like the original. However, much has been learned since the original ML1 speaker, and modern design and simulation tools were used to develop design parameters that provide a bass response similar to the original but without the need for an external equalizer. The woofer also uses McIntosh\u2019s patented Low Distortion High Performance (LD/HP\u00ae) Magnetic Circuit Design that significantly reduces distortion while increasing power handling and efficiency. The performance improvements from LD/HP are so vast that the 12\u2033 woofer in the ML1 could rival woofers twice its size.\nThe ML1 uses acustom-built crossover networkdesigned by McIntosh engineers for performance and durability. Over-specified components ensure high power handling, while solid state, self-resetting protection devices prevent damage to any of the drivers. The crossover design separates the high and low frequency circuits, and each are available both bi-wiring or bi-amping as desired. All the power sent to the ML1 from your amplifiers is fed through McIntosh\u2019s Solid Cinch\u2122\u00a0speaker binding posts that easily but securely attach the\u00a0speaker cables\u00a0to prevent them from coming loose and possibly causing a short. The binding posts are gold-plated to prevent corrosion and ensure a quality signal is sent through your speaker cables.\nLastly, the ML1 comes with a matching stand that features a vintage die cast aluminum name badge on the base that matches the badges found on some of McIntosh\u00a0amplifiers\u00a0and\u00a0integrated amplifiers.\nThe stand is designed to elevate and position the ML1 loudspeaker for optimum imaging and listening enjoyment. It comes with feet for use on hard floors, and spikes for use on carpet. The reimagined loudspeaker can also be set directly on the floor or placed on a sturdy piece of furniture.\n\u201cWhile we have been making loudspeakers for over five decades, the ML1 will always be our first and holds a special place in our hearts here at McIntosh,\u201d said McIntosh President Charlie Randall. \u201cWe\u2019re incredibly excited to showcase how far the brand has come over the more than half a century with the renewed ML1 and hope our community of listeners will enjoy listening to their favorite sounds on this classic remodel.\u201d\nThe McIntosh ML1 MKII loudspeaker will be available for USD$12,000 per pairthrough Authorized McIntosh Dealers starting July 2023.\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission."

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/audio-technica-ath-m50x/",
        "content": "In the early 1950s, a 32-year-old audio afficiando named Hideo Matsushita landed a job at Tokyo\u2019s Bridgestone Museum of Art \u2013\u2013 now called the Artizan Museum \u2013\u2013 after an introduction from a relative. The museum, located in the central part of the city, had opened a few years earlier to house its wealthy founder\u2019s art collection, but the complex also programmed film screenings, lectures, and recitals.\n\u201cAt the urging of the museum\u2019s director,\u201d Matsushita recalled in an archivalinterview, \u201cI began organizing LP concerts. These were much more successful than anyone imagined.\u201d Those public sessions were presented on gear from the soon-to-be center of the global hi-fi movement, which was then starting to produce components for high-end customers. Matsushita was excited by the response but frustrated that high-fidelity listening was cost-prohibitive for the masses. So in 1962 he struck out on his own and established an audio company called Audio Technica. It\u2019s aim was to bring great sound to The People.\ntl;dr version: The multimillion-dollar audio company Audio-Technica was born after a series of listening sessions.\nAdded the Audio-Techica founder of the beginnings: \u201cThe company immediately launched its first product, the AT-1 Stereo Cartridge. At that time, we were headquartered in a rented one-story barracks in Shinjuku. We started out with three employees, but quickly grew to 20. We worked late each night, stopping only for dinner at the ramen shop in front of the premises.\u201d\nAnyone obsessed with public full-album listening sessions, hi-fi sound and late-night ramen is okay in our book, but it wouldn\u2019t mean much had all that history not led us to Audio Technica\u2019s ATH-M50x headphones, a perfect blend of design, technology and affordability. There are sleeker headphones; headphones that in an A-B test might outperform the M50x; headphones with better noise-cancelation; headphones that more adeptly mimic surround sound. But they are not under $200, and you don\u2019t see them in studios of producers who can afford $1,000 headphones but still go for these utilitarian bangers.\nThis is the part of this recommendation where we\u2019re supposed to get to the specs and explain in detail how Audio-Technica does it.\nType: Closed-back dynamicDriver Diameter: 45 mmFrequency Response: 15 \u2013 28,000 HzMaximum Input Power: 1,600 mW at 1 kHzSensitivity: 99 dB\nAs you\u2019ll see when comparing the ATH-M50x with other brands and models, the specs aren\u2019t show-stopping. You can find headphones with double the driver diameter and high-end frequency response (numbers to pay attention to when comparing headphones) for $50 more, but they won\u2019t be as durable, efficient or time-tested. Audio-Technica\u2019s fancier ATH-AD500X headphones, in fact, have a driver diameter of 53 mm, which sends the waveform toward your eardrums through a slightly wider aperture. (By comparison, most earbuds have a driver diameter of 9-15 mm.)\nIt should be said that M50x headphones aren\u2019t bluetooth-enabled; you need a 3.5 mm audio jack or adapter to use these with most portable devices, and dongles suck. Which is to say, these work best for users who are okay with being tethered to their systems with a cord.\nThe solution: The ATH-M50xBT2, which according to Audio-Technica has \u201cthe same sonic signature of the legendary ATH-M50x studio headphones.\u201d Though bluetooth-enabled headphones do result in more signal loss than cord-reliant models, the difference is barely discernible, at least to these ears. Plus, the M50xBT2 comes with a jack and cord, so if need be these can be used just as you would the M50x.\nNote: a few reviewers have complained about sound cutting out, so be sure to research this issue before you buy. That said, we love our wireless M50xBT2s and have never had connectivity issues with them."

        "content": "This is a post without many words. Mostly the aim is to offer drool-worthy, curious, or otherwise engaging advertisements from the peak hi-fi era of the 1970s, when competition for consumer dollars, coupled with overwhelming demand for home sound systems, generated gear that a half-century later endures.\nTo explore, say, High Fidelity magazine issues from 1973, is to experience desire for objects you never knew you needed. A display ad for, say, Altec\u2019s array of speaker systems from that year, is likely to send you to Reverb or HiFiShark in search of possible deals.\nA simple flip of the digital page reveals aesthetic feats like the JBL 88 Plus.\nThe Empire 598 II from 1973 is a covetable turntable that, five decades later, still generates wonder. Another Empire ad from the era celebrates the company\u2019s 4000D four-channel phono cartridge by depicting it dancing atop a record.\n\u201cWhenever I played my stereo loud my wife made plans to move to her mother\u2019s,\u201d says this cigar-smoking, pinky-ring-wearing, hair-permed guy. \u201cThen a Marantz dealer wised me up. It\u2019s not playing your stereo loud that\u2019s bugging her, he said. It\u2019s the distortion that\u2019s driving her cuckoo. Get a Marantz.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018Where\u2019s the flute Henry?\u2019 my wife complained constantly. I was about ready to leave her. Then we saw a Marantz dealer. He told us that separation of sound is the true test of a speaker system \u2026 you get distortion-free sounds that are as pleasing as a nibble on the ear.\u201d\nThe Sansui Corp\u2019s advertising firm took copious amounts of LSD before crafting this campaign.

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/klipsch-wharfedale-audiophile-system-builder/",
        "content": "Space. Not the final frontier but the amount of room that all of us have to play with in our homes. Klipsch and Wharfedale customers know all about that issue. Over the past 24 years, I\u2019ve been fortunate to visit the listening rooms of about a dozen fellow reviewers in Canada and the United States \u2013 and almost all of them had one thing in common.\nNot a single one was a completely dedicated listening room isolated from the rest of the house or apartment. Most of the listening rooms were typical dens, living rooms, or home office set-ups. None of the rooms were especially cavernous or horrible acoustic spaces. They were the types of rooms that most people actually share with spouses, children, pets, and stacks of books, records, and furniture. Real life.\nA few are lucky to have a dedicated space that has been treated with acoustic treatments and doesn\u2019t interfere with the day-to-day operation of a house.\u00a0That wouldn\u2019t be me.\u00a0For the most part, I listen in my den, living room, home office, and dining room (one of the best acoustic spaces in our home).\u00a0People enjoy listening to music while they eat. Or sitting at the dining room table late at night working. Most people have to work with what they have. That reality heavily influences what they buy.\nYour room has a huge impact on the sound quality of your system. A smaller room can work really well if you make intelligent choices in regard to equipment and set-up.\nOurMusic Editorhas put off improving her system for the past few years for that very reason. She recently purchased her first home and will be delving into this very topic this month. She is a vinyl-centric listener with a great ear and sizable collection.\nWhen we were discussingher first series of audio reviews, the issue of space and creating a great sounding system for smaller rooms became the topic of conversation. For those paying attention on social media platforms \u2013 it is a topic that comes up quite frequently.\nYour room has a huge impact on the sound quality of your system. A smaller room can work really well if you make intelligent choices in regard to equipment and set-up. My den is 16\u2032 x 13\u2032 x 9\u2032 and I listen with the speakers positioned along the long wall and 8\u2032 from my sofa. If your room is smaller than that \u2014 you are listening in a smaller listening space. A 10\u2032 x 10\u2032 bedroom or dorm room is a smaller listening space.\nHow you listen also matters.\nKlipsch recently released the newKlipsch RP-600M MKII, but having already sampled them \u2014 I\u2019m going to direct you back to the original model which I think is superior. Think Coke Classic versus \u201cNew\u201d Coke. You should be able to find a pair of the original still online or from a dealer and you will be sorry if you think \u201cnewer\u201d model means better.\nWe have seen the original RP-600M for sale on Amazon for under $380 USD and that\u2019s a steal for these loudspeakers. TheKlipsch Audio RP-600M loudspeakersare amazing for a small room though they do benefit from some space behind them and solid stands. They can work on a credenza, but I found them too large for any bookshelf.\nThey are not very difficult to drive, but during their three-month visit in my den (16\u2019 x 13\u2019 x 9\u2019) I discovered that their 96 dB (as quoted by Klipsch in its literature) sensitivity rating was being somewhat optimistic.\nThey are also somewhat restrained sounding by Klipsch standards. The horn-loaded tweeter can be too much if your amplifier or sources are too forward sounding but can also be quite civilized in a smaller listening space.\nBefore you look at their 6.5\u201d Cerametallic\u2122 cone woofers\u00a0and begin to salivate over how much bone crunching bass they obviously create \u2013 lower your expectations. Their bass performance is on the more defined side and actually quite tight. Even in a smaller listening space, they need to be pulled away from the walls. Quality over quantity.\u00a0What makes them so special at their affordable price point is the remarkable degree of presence that they deliver.\nThe choice of side dish will have an enormous impact on the sound quality.\nThe Heed Elixir orSchiit Audio Ragnarok 2integrated amplifiers work especially well with the Klipsch RP-600M. The Heed has a better phono stage but lacks the Ragnarok\u2019s internal DAC and superior headphone amplifier.\nNeither amplifier has a forward sounding treble which is what you want with these loudspeakers.\u00a0They both share a warm tonal balance and excellent pacing. The Heed will create a larger sounding soundstage with the RP-600M.\nVocals will be presented forward of the front baffle of the loudspeaker. Horns should have excellent energy without ripping your ears off. Emotional engagement with your favorite music will be exceptionally high.\nWharfedale likes to keep its loudspeaker line-up fresh and there is plenty to like about thenewDiamond 12.1(reviewed here) two-way loudspeakers.\u00a0A pair of Diamond 10.1s get daily use in my home office so it\u2019s fair to say that I\u2019m a fan after all of these years.\nThe Diamond 12.1 are not particularly large loudspeakers (12.2\u2033 H x 7\u2033 W x 10.9\u2033 D) but they\u2019re a great match for smaller spaces on their matching ST-3 24\u201d stands.\u00a0 They are also not especially hard to drive but they do sound better with between 35-50 watts.\nBetween theNAD C 316BEEandCambridge Audio AXA35integrated amplifiers, it\u2019s hard to go wrong but I\u2019m sticking with the AXA35 in this system because its tonal balance offsets the neutrality of the Diamond 12.1 better.\nI own both amplifiers and swap back and forth a lot so don\u2019t think I\u2019m dismissing the NAD in any way. The NAD has a slight bump in the midrange that works incredibly well with more restrained sounding loudspeakers like theQ Acoustics 3050iand3030i.\nThe 12.1 are not bass monsters but they do everything else so well for the price that it\u2019s easy to forgive that crime of omission.\u00a0Those about to move on because they can\u2019t pulverize your room with bass \u2013 you\u2019re making a rookie mistake.\u00a0Quality not quantity.\nAnd to flesh out the bottom octaves, I suggest adding a subwoofer with these excellent loudspeakers.\u00a0But not just any subwoofer.\u00a0REL\u2019s latest TZero MKIII is their smallest subwoofer but don\u2019t be fooled by its size. REL has always been about quality over quantity and all of their subwoofers do more than just add extended bass response to your system.\nWhen you have it set-up properly, the REL will make the Diamond 12.1 sound larger, more transparent as you raise the volume, and expand the size and width of the soundstage.\nThe AXA35 includes a very competent MM phono stage that works well with high-output Ortofon, Audio-Technica, and Nagaoka cartridges.\nAdd theAndover Songbird/Schiit Audio Modi 3+ streamer/DAC combination and you\u2019re done.\nAudiophile System Builder: Part 1(Magnepan, Q Acoustics, Acoustic Energy, \u2026)\nAudiophile System Builder: Part 2(Zu Audio, Omega Speakers, \u2026)\nView list of allAudiophile System Builderarticles."

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/martinlogan-request-electrostatic-speakers-getting-better-with-age/",
        "content": "I vividly remember the day I flipped over the copy ofStereophileat the newsstand and saw my first pair of MartinLogan loudspeakers. Having inherited the family stereo in 1983 as my Bar Mitzvah gift, I was already on my audiophile journey but I was not prepared for the MartinLogan Sequel II loudspeakers that would inspire me to make high-end audio my career. The Sequel II were my first high-end speakers but only the beginning of my journey which culminated with the MartinLogan reQuest speakers.\nBefore I spent almost $5,000 on a pair of reQuests, I spent almost 8 years with the Aerius, Aerius i, and a pair of the original CLS speakers. I was such a huge fan of the company that I called their office in 1987 in Lawrence, Kansas because I had a question about my pair of Sequel II speakers.\nImagine my surprise when MartinLogan founder, Gayle Sanders, took the call and spent an hour on the phone with me. I was 17 years old and in the process of looking at college applications which included the University of Kansas in Lawrence. Israel and GWU would be my final destination but that one hour on the phone cemented my future in high-end audio and my love of electrostatic loudspeakers. I just didn\u2019t know it at the time.\nFast forward to 2019 and the last real high-end audio show in Rockville, Maryland before the COVID-19 pandemic would disrupt the planet.\nPR Queen Sue Toscano and I have been friends for many years but she was unaware of my history with MartinLogan and how Gayle Sanders had influenced it back in 1987.\nGayle Sanders sold MartinLogan many years ago and had retired from the audio industry to enjoy the fruits of his 25+ years of hard work and success. Those who know him understood that he would return which he did withEikon Audio.\nGayle Sanders and I finally met in 2019 and it was a very memorable day for me meeting the man who set everything in motion for me. He was as gracious as I remember him from our only phone call.\nEikon Audiojust introduced a new two-way system at Capital Audio Fest 2021 that Gayle and I discuss inour recent podcast.\nNow that you know the history, let\u2019s take a look at the MartinLogan reQuest loudspeakers that have been out of production for many years but are one of the best used electrostatic loudspeakers if you can find one.\nThe reQuests were really large back in 1999 when I bought them and I\u2019m sure most people would recoil with some hesitation if they came across a pair today.\nAt 71\u2033H x 18\u2033W x 13\u2033D and 95 pounds apiece, the reQuests are big transducers.\nThe 48\u2033 CLS electrostatic transducer panel has a lifespan of around 12-15 years; and it\u2019s something you need to dust on a regular basis with a vacuum to keep in operational shape. You definitely hear it when the panel starts to show its age. MartinLogan will sell you replacement panels but they\u2019re not $100-$200; so something to think about if you find a pair in good condition with the original panels.\nThe 12-inch high excursion woofer was a big improvement over the smaller drivers in the Sequel II, Aerius, and Aerius i.\nWhat really made the reQuest a better speaker and one of my favorite MartinLogan models was the integration of the woofer and electrostatic panel \u2014 many electrostatic speakers that try to blend both fail miserably.\nThe transparency (the reason why you buy this type of loudspeaker) was jaw dropping with some recordings. There was an ethereal quality to the human voice that would make you sit up and pay attention to every little detail.\nThe other interesting feature of the reQuest was its 90 dB sensitivity rating and impedance (4 ohms).\nHaving owned 4 other pairs of MartinLogan speakers, power is definitely an issue. You can run tube amplifiers with the reQuest but they need to be stable into 4 ohms and at least 50-75 watts/channel.\nI would definitely recommend CJ (solid-state), Pass Labs, Mark Levinson (1980s or 1990s), Bryston, Adcom, Aragon, and older Krell with these loudspeakers.\nThe amp that worked for me was a huge surprise. TheBlue Circle BC6SET Hybrid Amplifier which was only 25 watts/channel. Gilbert Yeung and I were friends for a number of years when I still lived in Toronto and I would make the trip to Innerkip on a regular basis to listen to his new amps and go for food. The BC6 did not operate like any 25 watt amplifier that I\u2019ve ever heard and it matched the reQuest almost perfectly.\nGilbert used the MartinLogan CLS and CLS IIz in his listening room so I wasn\u2019t surprised that the BC6 worked so well.\nIt didn\u2019t possess the low-end control of a Bryston, Aragon, or Krell \u2014 but the midrange resolution and tonal balance was so good that I would listen to the speakers for 3-4 hours at night and awaken in my listening chair at 2 or 3 a.m. almost longing for another session.\nThe transparency (the reason why you buy this type of loudspeaker) was jaw dropping with some recordings. There was an ethereal quality to the human voice that would make you sit up and pay attention to every little detail. The soundstage was also quite wide and deep in my space and the reQuest delivered music with scale and presence like few other speakers.\nIf you don\u2019t have the space for a large pair of electrostatic loudspeakers, these speakers will not work for you. They don\u2019t need to be 5-feet from the wall behind them, but I wouldn\u2019t consider them unless you can move the speaker at least 3-feet out and give them 36-48\u2033 from the sidewalls.\nI ran my pair of reQuests in 3 different apartments and my smallest listening space was 20\u2032 x 16\u2032 x 9\u2032 and always hardwood floors with an area rug.\nThey benefitted from breaking up the hard surfaces behind them by placing two floor-to-ceiling bookshelves filled with books and other forms of absorption. I made sure that the windows in my room had heavy velvet drapes and left them partially open to deal with the reflections off the back wall and ceiling.\nThe MartinLogan reQuest came with rather sharp spikes (mandatory) and I did upgrade the power cords (they require electricity) from the cheap ones provided to $100 models from Blue Circle Audio; they made a significant difference in regard to lowering the noise floor of the speakers and improving the panel\u2019s clarity. I hate audiophile power cords but these particular cords worked.\nI know that this sounds like the behavior of a crazy person but it never looked or felt like overkill for the simple reason that the sound quality I was able to achieve with them was the best I\u2019ve ever had and I wish I could turn back the clock and put that same system together again.\nI\u2019ve seen used reQuest online for between $1,400 \u2014 $1,800 USD and I would say that they are worth it if the panel has been replaced in the past 5 years or less.\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission.\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/audiocraft-magazine-tips/",
        "content": "The science of sound \u2013 how high-fidelity systems do what they do, and why \u2013 has been a subject of obsessive fascination since the rise of stereophonic systems in the 1950s. As we\u2019ve highlighted before, when first-generation audio engineers including Paul Klipsch (Klipsch) and Henry Kloss (Acoustic Research, Advent) started building their legendary speaker systems, they did so first as hobbyists whose obsession with sound reproduction and serious listening propelled them toward solutions.\nThe early makers who took to basements and woodsheds to experiment with sound were surprisingly generous with their findings. When they figured something out they often shared the information with other Hi-Fi heads through start-up magazines. One of the most fascinating was Audiocraft.\nThough it only lasted three years, the information within offers a window into the quest for better sound and, by extension, better listening rooms.\nThose of us lucky enough to have space for a communal sessions, for example, might be wondering how much power you need in an amplifier to ensure you\u2019ve got enough for everyone to hear. The advice is pretty straightforward, and comes via an editorial in theNov. 1957 issue.\nHow much sound/wattage you need depends on three factors:\n1. Room size. Bigger room = more sound needed. It\u2019s a direct proportion.\n2. Surface absorption. How much stuff in the room absorbs sound affects how much sound you need. A room with a lot of drapes, carpets, and padding needs more sound than a room with hard surfaces.\n3. Type of music. Big music with lots of frequency range makes louder sounds than small groups or solo instruments.\nThe editor, Roy Allison, explains that if you want to awe your listening crew, you want a sound level of about 100 decibels. To get that level in a room that\u2019s about 18 by 12 by 15 feet, with average absorption, you need about a quarter of a watt of acoustic power. That\u2019s for a small room. If you have a more efficient speaker, you need less power. If you have a bigger or more absorptive room, you need more power.\nDoes Audiocraft get into the weeds? Absolutely, and for those not schooled in audio engineering terms, it might take you a day of reading through the issues to fully grasp the jargon. But doing so will yield information you can use for the rest of your life.\nFor example, speaker efficiency is key, but what is it? It\u2019s \u201cthe percentage of acoustic energy radiated in all directions from a speaker, compared to the input of a given amount of power (3% to 4% efficiency is typical for a woofer),\u201d per Galaxy Audio.\nArmed with this information, you can start to understand wattage needs, and understand that speaker efficiency is the most important factor when setting up a listening space. Depending on the speaker and the model, efficiency can vary from less than 1% to nearly 50%. If you have a 40% efficient speaker in an average small room, you only need \u215d watt to get the 100-decibel sound level. But if you have a 1% efficient speaker, you need 25 watts of power. And if your room is three times larger and twice as absorptive, you need 15 watts of power with a 1% efficient speaker.\nAudiocraft also featured profiles of ridiculous homemade systems of the 1950s, the best of which is a mini camper that a sound dude transformed into a rolling hi-fi system.\n\u201cMr. Tatum\u2019s Carnegie Hall,\u201d pictured above, wasa project outlinedin the Jan. 1957 issue. Written by Brooks Tatum, it opens with his issue: he\u2019s both a naturalist and a music freak. \u201cMy problem was to get high-fidelity sound reproduction, from radio and records, into a mobile home 17 feet long, 7 feet in diameter, and of 500 cubic feet total volume.\u201d\nAcross the next three pages, Tatum describes how he did it. For example, his corner wardrobe doubled as a speaker baffle. Included resonant spaces in the floor. He insulated it. In essence, he pretended his mobile home was a speaker cabinet. His conclusion: \u201cThe power and attack of this reproducing system are the source of continuing amazement. Its ability to encompass the entire tonal range \u2026 without effort or default is unexpected and extremely gratifying.\u201d\nThough none of us are likely going to work through these experiments ourselves, it\u2019s reassuring to know that not that long ago a community endeavored to document the ways in which deep listening and high-fidelity send evolved.\nRead the entire three-year run at World Radio History."

        "title": "What\u2019s the Difference Between a Preamplifier, Integrated Amplifier, Power Amp and Receiver?",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/basic-hi-fi-components/",
        "content": "Amplifier. Amp. Preamp. Integrated amp. Phono stage. Tube amplifier. Mono-block. Active speaker. Control amp. Receiver. Solid-state amplifier. Step-up transformer. Powered speaker. Power amp. Phono preamp.\nIf you\u2019re new to high-end audio and looking to build out a system inspired by some of the components you\u2019ve see on Instagram, or something owned by one of your audiophile friends, you are going to need to think about amplification, and you are guaranteed to come across some of the terms from the previous paragraph during your research. But what do they mean?\nThose are a long list of component types but when it comes down to it, you\u2019re basically looking at three things:\nDifferent kinds of amplifiers do one or more of these three things.\nPreamps (also called control amps) are for connecting and selecting sources or inputs like turntables, CD players, tape players/recorders, tuners and other \u201cauxiliary\u201d (AUX) devices, and managing sound characteristics such as volume, treble, bass and balance. They control your inputs and sound, and output a signal to a power amplifier.\nMost of the inputs on a preamp are standard \u201cline-level\u201d inputs. Standardized source output and preamp input levels allow mixing and matching of source components from different manufacturers, safe in the knowledge that they will be compatible with each other.\nBecause source output signals are standardized, you can plug any line-level source into any line-level input (eg. a CD player into the Tuner input, or tape deck into the AUX input) and it will sound the same. This gives flexibility, especially when using modern sources with vintage amps (or vice versa) that weren\u2019t specifically designed for each other.\nHowever, the only non-standard inputs are the one or two phono (or turntable) inputs (see phono preamplifier below). Do not plug line-level sources into phono inputs as you\u2019ll blow the amp or your ears or both.\nMany preamps manufactured between 1995 and 2015 may have omitted phono inputs because vinyl wasn\u2019t very popular at the time; theresurgence of vinylover the past 8 years has changed that situation with most manufacturers offering an internal moving magnet phono preamp inside their preamplifiers, integrated amplifiers, andAVRs.\nA preamp cannot be used independently to drive loudspeakers, and so you won\u2019t see any \u201cwatts per channel\u201d specifications. You also won\u2019t see any speaker output jacks on the back. To get sound to speakers, you\u2019ll need a power amp.\nAlso called a phono stage, and if specifically for Moving Coil (MC) cartridges, a step-up transformer (or SUT) may be in the circuit before the actual phono section. See this article for a write-up ondifferences between Moving Magnet (MM) and MC cartridges.\nA phono preamp takes the very low output from a standardturntable(and very, very, very low output if said turntable is equipped with an MC cartridge) and amplifies it to line level so your preamp can then process it like all the other inputs.\nIt may sound simple to just amplify a low-level signal to line level, but that\u2019s not the case. The signal from the turntable contains two kinds of sound: the sound you want (the music) and sound you don\u2019t want (noise induced by friction and vibration as a tiny diamond rubs against the moving grooves of a spinning vinyl disk on a motorized machine). The phono preamp must be selective, keeping the music and using sophisticated circuitry to filter out the noise. The more sophisticated the amplification and noise filtering, the more expensive the phono preamp.\nThis can all get a bit confusing, but you can think of it this way:\nPower amps (back in the day called simply \u201camplifiers\u201d) are where you connect your loudspeakers, and they\u2019re devoted to transforming output from a preamp to a strong enough electrical signal to move the big, heavy magnets in your speaker drivers.\nPower amps don\u2019t have many inputs or outputs. Typically on a stereo power amp there will be two RCA inputs for the left and right channels coming from your pre-amp, and four speaker output jacks (two each for left and right channels). Some power amplifiers will have balanced XLR inputs as well.\nSome power amps are designed for two sets of speakers, and you\u2019ll see eight speaker-out jacks on the back (four each for A and B sets) and a speaker selector switch on the front.\nConversely, some power amps are designed for just one speaker. These can be used for a mono set-up, or in pairs connected individually to the left and right outputs of a preamp. Mono power amplifiers used this way are commonly called \u201cmonoblocks.\u201d\nThe output of a power amp is measured in watts per channel, with 20 to 50 watts per channel sufficient to satisfactorily drive most vintage and consumer-grade bookshelf or stand-mount speakers, while more power (sometimes in the hundreds of watts) will be necessary for loudspeakers that are more difficult to drive and require the amplifier to double its output into 4 or 2 ohms.\nAnintegrated ampcombines both a preamp and power amp in one box (the pre- and power functions are integrated). There are advantages and disadvantages to integrating the two.\nIntegrated amplifiers take up less space than a two-box pre/power solution. They can also be made more cheaply as everything is housed in one cabinet. The popularity of integrated amps really took off in the late 1960s as solid-state technology (smaller and cheaper with less heat output) began to replace tubes in amplification devices.\nFor high-end audiophiles, the main perceived drawback of integrated amplifiers is reduced sound quality, partly because getting everything packed into one box puts size pressure on all component parts (smaller capacitors and diodes and transformers and heatsink negatively impact signal quality), and partly because electronic circuits are so close together (resulting in electronic interference and degradation of signal purity).\nAnother audiophile benefit of separate amplification is the ability to mix-and-match components, pairing a high-quality preamp from one manufacturer with a top-class power amp from another to achieve the desired sound quality.\nIntegrated amplifiers became popular with the average consumer in the \u201870s and beyond as a cost-effective, space-saving music solution, while serious audiophiles prefer(red) the quality of separate pre- and power amplifiers. That said, many high-end integrated amplifiers produce excellent sound and are still very popular with audiophiles.\nJust as an integrated amplifier combines pre and power amplification functions in a single box, a receiver combines a radio (or tuner) with an integrated amplifier.\nReceivers became popular for similar reasons as integrated amplifiers: space saving and price. Nowadays an added attraction of receivers is the esthetic beauty \u2013 that space-cadet glow \u2013 of the tuning dial (few modern receiver owners actually use them to listen to the radio).\nReceivers became quite large \u2013 if not massive \u2013in the late \u201870s \u201cGolden Era\u201d of audio as manufacturers led by Pioneer,Marantz,Sansuiand Technics strove to out-do each other by producing top-of-the-line receivers with higher and higher power output in a trend known as \u201cThe Receiver Wars,\u201d culminating in 1979 with the Technics SA-1000 which output 330 watts per channel!\nA traditional audio system consists of source components (turntable, tuner, tape deck, CD player, etc.) some sort of amplifier (pre-plus-power combo, integrated amp or receiver) and a set of speakers. The speakers in these systems can\u2019t make sound without the amplifier, and so they are considered \u201cpassive.\u201d\nActive (or powered) speakers take the space-saving \u201ceverything-in-one-box\u201d trend to the extreme, combining amplification (pre and power) and speaker within one (or two) speaker cabinets.\nActive speakers come in a variety of styles. They can be mono or stereo. Single speaker or pair. Wireless or wired. Bluetooth or WiFi. With analog (RCA, XLR), digital (USB, coaxial, optical, HDMI), or analog-and-digital inputs.\nThese days many desktop computer and gaming speakers are active, and may combine with active subwoofers (another kind of active speaker) for enhanced bass.\nOne of the advantages of active loudspeakers is that you have fewer components; which saves both space and money. You also need fewer cables.\nHigh-end manufacturers have introduced a rather significant number of active loudspeakers over the past few years; whilst most are Bluetooth products, there are a growing number of active wireless loudspeakers from traditional high-end brands like Q Acoustics, KEF, Klipsch, PSB, Dynaudio, and Triangle that offer a much higher level of performance.\nSo, there you have it. It all comes down to device selection, sound manipulation, and boosting the music signal so speakers can make a pleasant sound.\nYou are now armed with the lingo required to hit your preferred audio retailer with confidence, or spend an afternoon listening to your dearest audiophile friend without your head spinning in confusion.\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission.\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "title": "Empire Troubador 598 Turntable: Exit to Vintage Street",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/empire-troubador-598/",
        "content": "Back in 2021, I wrote aboutwhat attracts me to Vintage Audio.I discussed several factors, like style, craftsmanship and environmental friendliness. I ended by highlighting the intangible value of a piece\u2019s story.\nSometimes the story is about the item itself (who owned it, how it came to the seller, what it was used for in the past) and others it\u2019s more about the manufacturer and model (innovations, where it fits in a brand\u2019s history).\nFor example, my Sansui AU-555 was given to my brother in the early \u201880s by his boss at his part-time furniture re-finishing job. After sitting in his basement for decades, it came to me 5 years ago, and the hand-me-down tale adds to the special feelings I have for it.\nMy KEF Calinda speakers were some of the first ever speakers to feature cabinet and driver placement designed on computers; speaker technology has moved on since 1976, but knowledge of that innovation enhances these speakers\u2019 value in my mind.\nTwo weeks ago I purchased a new (to me) vintage turntable, and this one also involves stories, both of seller and buyer.\nIn early 2019, as I was just getting back into vinyl, my Instagram friend Kevin (@mistachen) shot me a message about a turntable for sale that he thought would be a good step up for me. An Empire Troubador 598 (forget which model). C$450. Beautiful. The photos don\u2019t even do this remarkable turntable justice.\nHaving just gotten my first turntable a few months before, and not knowing too much about what was what, I hardly even knew what I was looking at. Old for sure, and sexy, and shiny-champagne-gold. Intimidating. Too much turntable for my system of the time. I dithered. It sold. I didn\u2019t think too much of it.\nI\u2019d like to think my turntable knowledge has improved since then. Just a bit. Over the intervening 30 months, every now and then an Empire would pop up on my Instagram feed or in a Facebook audio group and I\u2019d drool. Still sexy. Not so intimidating anymore. Less overkill for my evolving system. I\u2019d flash back to the one I passed on and think, \u201cWhat if?\u201d\nI follow quite a few vintage audio sellers and restorers on Instagram. I get amazingly satisfying, vicarious pleasure from watching restoration projects progress and unfold, and then seeing the end-result pieces available for sale or integrated into working systems.\nSometimes pieces show up fully fledged, with no restoration story. That\u2019s fine; I can still admire, drool and covet. About a month ago, a post popped up on Instagram from@woostervintageaudioin Ohio featuring an exquisite Empire 598 Troubadour III for sale.\nBeautiful, but not a realistic purchase for me as I prefer to buy local, particularly when it comes to turntables (I see too many unboxing posts of destroyed equipment, poorly packaged by the seller or poorly handled by the courier, and don\u2019t want to take chances either way).\nFiguring someone would be interested, I shared the Empire post in my IG story. Not sure if it drew any traffic for Wooster, but a few hours later I got a personal message from Dan (@iloveyoucoffeeshop), a local Instagram connection, saying his uncle was looking to sell an Empire and asking if I\u2019d be interested.\nA few days and messages back and forth later, I got an email with photos from his uncle, Sam, and a couple of days after that I popped over for an up-close look.\nA few years ago, Sam took care of a house and dog for a friend for several weeks and was given the Empire (and some other equipment) in lieu of cash payment. That became part of his sizzling audio set-up for the next few years.\nThen recently his son downsized from house to apartment, couldn\u2019t accommodate a full-sized audio system, and passed it on to him. Now Sam\u2019s living area was overrun with audio equipment, and the Empire was assigned to the surplus-to-requirements list.\nEverything seemed fine with the player, barring what sounded like a minor suspension issue and a couple of blemishes to the champagne gold finish on the platter (a common issue I understand, and not surprising with a 50 year-old piece). The price was more than reasonable, and into the back of my car it went.\nSo what\u2019s so special about the Empire 598 then, besides its retro-magic looks?\nThe early \u201870s brochure states:\u201cThe turntable was designed to far exceed professional standards of performance\u2026 Long life and trouble-free operation are guaranteed\u2026 by an ingenious turntable design that involves only two moving parts, a powerful hysteresis synchronous motor and a heavy aluminium turntable platter individually balanced to the peak of perfection. Finally, the handsome and functional looks will enhance any room. This is the world\u2019s most perfect record playback system. With cast aluminium platter, fitted with the Empire 990 Tonearm.\u201d\nI can\u2019t really argue with that. The 598 Troubador was introduced in 1970 and stayed in production until 1976. Some will argue that its predecessor, the 498, was better, but there aren\u2019t many of those around and the 598 is the one you see most often. The 698 that followed coincided with a change of ownership (and decline in Empire\u2019s fortunes) and was rife with performance issues.\nThere were multiple iterations of the belt-driven 598 (you\u2019ll see Mark I, II and III). It\u2019s not 100% clear what the differences are and in some cases it seems parts and specifications are somewhat interchangeable.\nThere\u2019s a good thread onAudioKarmaabout the history of Empire and their turntables.\nThe one now in my basement is the two-speed (33.33 and 45 rpm) Mark II, with a 12\u2033 cast aluminium, two-piece platter (the drive portion is 7 lbs and 3 inches thick; once in motion, it acts as a massive flywheel which helps maintain accurate speed).\nIt features a dynamically balanced hysteresis synchronous motor, micro-honed oilite main bearings, pneumatic suspension, and Empire\u2019s own 990 tonearm.\nAll of this goodness is mounted on a heavy wood plinth with impressive wood-and-glass flip-up cover. Ideally there\u2019d be an Empire cartridge installed, but the Pickering VX-15 it came with sounds very nice.\nThe suspension issue noted at purchase (the platter rubbed on the top plate on one side) was easily repaired by adjusting the three wingnuts that attach the platter mechanism to the plinth on the underside. That taken care of, the table operates almost flawlessly. Speed is incredibly accurate, wow and flutter almost non-existent, and sound is superb, with no perceptible rumble, hum or other background noise.\nIf I have one gripe, it is with the auto-lift function at the end of a record, which is finicky. The mechanism is magnetic and engages via a metal piece protruding from the pivot end of the tonearm.\nAs the record ends and the stylus enters the lead out grooves, the protrusion gets closer to the magnetic arm lifter, which lifts and pulls the arm up and over at the same time.\nWith most records the arm lift works fine, but those with a narrow lead-out groove are a problem as the lift mechanism engages before the music is over, with a loud, jarring sound that gives an unsatisfying ending to the final track.\nMy initial solution to this issue was to use one of my other turntables for records with less than a centimeter of lead-out, but I then learned that the auto-lift can be disengaged by tilting the lift column, making the table fully manual.\nNot perfect, but a reasonable workaround. At least I\u2019m not forced to choose which turntable I\u2019ll use based on how nightmarish my end-of-record experience will be.\nMinor gripes aside, this Empire Troubadour is absolutely a keeper. It\u2019s not surprising that Empire turntables, back in the early \u201870s, were considered \u201ctop tier\u201d along with Rek-O-Kut, Thorens and Acoustic Research, and used as transcription players by radio stations across North America. I\u2019m honoured to own one of these beauties, and love having another piece of music history in my listening room.\nAnd that\u2019s the story of the Empire. If you\u2019d like to see more, hop onto my Instagram at@audioloveyycfor a lot of pictures of the 598 and what I\u2019m spinning on it. I\u2019ll leave you there, and hopefully this lead-out is smoother than some of my early Empire 598 record spins.\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission.\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "title": "Vintage Bookshelf Speakers: DeVore Fidelity Gibbon 3",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/devore-fidelity-gibbon-3/",
        "content": "DeVore Fidelity has been handcrafting world class loudspeakers out of its workshop in Brooklyn\u2019s Navy Yards for almost 20 years and over that time, I have been fortunate to experience many of its designs at home, dealer showrooms, trade shows, and people\u2019s homes.\nWandering into theCommon Wave Audio Hi-Fi room at T.H.E. Show in June 2022, was my first time in many years to have the opportunity to listen to one of John\u2019s latest creations and after spending more than 45 minutes listening to the O/baby \u2013 I was left with some serious regret in regard to an older pair ofDeVore Gibbon 3sthat I was forced to sell back in 2009.\nThere is a wonderful scene in Carl Reiner\u2019s 1967 comedyEnter Laughingwhere Reni Santoni\u2019s character enters the set with an insane laugh and then looks into the audience and suffers the worst case of stage fright in the history of theater. After some prodding from Elaine May, he recovers and gets better with each scene, but it\u2019s a good thing that he always had pharmacy school to fall back on.\nJohn Devore doesn\u2019t have to worry about going to pharmacy school, because the smallest member of the DeVore line-up was positively killer. It required more power than the Gibbon Super 8s or original Silverback Reference loudspeakers, but with the right amplifier; and not necessarily a very expensive one, it was one of the best 2-way monitors I have ever listened to and easy to work with if you can\u2019t get away with stands in the middle of your room.\nAt 12.5\u201dH x 6.5\u201d W x 9.5\u201d D, the Gibbon 3s were not exactly huge; they just sounded that way. They were manufactured and assembled in DeVore\u2019s Brooklyn-based factory and available in several beautiful hardwood veneers. My personal pair were finished in a light cherry and had a wonderful grain throughout.\nThe fit and finish were superb and while they were not inexpensive at $1,700 USD per pair back in 2006, there was nothing off-the-shelf (minus the Cardas binding posts) about the drivers which were custom-designed by Scanspeak for this specific loudspeaker to John\u2019s very exact specifications.\nThey were also a rear-ported design that did not suffer from bass bloat if they were placed too close to the wall behind them \u2014 a feature that I always felt was unique.\nSetting up the Gibbon 3s was a lot of fun, because its size allowed me to try it in more than one room; and even inside a wall unit which is where it might end up for some listeners.\nSpeakers have come and gone over the years, but speaker stands filled with sand never seem to get the hint. Being 6\u2019 3\u201d tall, I require taller stands for stand-mounted speakers, so I tried the Gibbon 3s on 24\u201d and 28\u201d stands (both were of the 4-post sand-filled variety with those nasty spikes that pierce flesh), ultimately preferring the 24\u201d height due to the tighter bass response and image height.\nMy living room (at the time) was 20\u2019 x 13\u2019 x 8\u2019, with my listening chair 4\u2019 from the wall behind it. A 108\u201d wide built-in maple/cherry wall unit took up most of the right side of the room. Additional seating, a fireplace (opening was covered up during reviews), and my equipment rack occupied the left side of the room. Our hardwood floor was partially covered by an 8\u2032 x 10\u2032 wool rug.\nThe room was on the \u201clively\u201d side, but the wall unit, seating, and carpet did a decent job of taming it. All the windows were covered with absorbent horizontal blinds.\nThe first position I tried was on the 24\u201d stands with the rear of the speakers 36\u201d from the wall behind them. The outside edges of the speakers were 20\u201d from the sidewalls. I started with the speakers pointed straight ahead, which is generally how I\u2019ve always positioned speakers in my room. The results were encouraging (after about 30 hours of abuse \u2013 AC/DC), but I felt that the sound could be more \u201copen\u201d with them pulled out even further.\nAt 45\u201d, I hit the target. The distance from the sidewalls was not enough and I ended up pushing them closer together so that they were 32\u201d from the edge to the walls. Everything seemed to gel, and I left them there (making them an easy target for my baby daughter) for the duration of the review.\nDeVore Fidelity\u2019s literature claimed that the Gibbon 3\u2019s frequency response was 45Hz \u2013 30kHz (+/-dB?) and while we have no technical measurements to refute or validate that claim, my time spent living with the speakers and specific amplifiers, proved that the Gibbon 3s were certainly capable of reproducing very deep and taut bass response; certainly, a lot more than its size suggested.\nAt 86dB (8 ohms), the Gibbon 3s were not a SET-friendly load, unless one were thinking of using something with 845 output tubes. My Fi X amplifier loaded with Sophia 2A3s barely made a dent. No shirt, no shoes, no dice. The Fi only offered a mere glimpse of the Gibbon 3\u2019s un-boxy sounding midrange and extended top end.\nThe late-Don Garber even warned me before I tried his wonderful amplifier that it was not a combination that would work.\nNext up were the Leben CS-300x integrated amplifier and Shindo Labs Montille power amplifier; both push-pull EL84 designs offering 12 juicy watts. The Montille has gain pots which can be raised/lowered depending on your choice of preamplifier (Shindo Labs Aurieges L and Fi Y) and I generally left them at the midnight hour. I occasionally tried them at 1 or 2, but 90 per cent of my listening was done at 12 O\u2019clock.\nBrownie McGhee and Sonny Terry\u2019s rendition of \u201cEveryday I have the Blues\u201d may have been foreshadowing of some mischief yet to come, but boy did it sound sweet and expansive while it lasted. The Leben CS-300x was a really underrated product.\nThe Gibbon 3s are a very open and immediate sounding loudspeaker that excel in the midrange and treble; wonderfully open, tonally rich, and blessed with top end extension that is airy and never etched or shrill. While quite resolute in the bass, the Leben just didn\u2019t have the power or grip to really drive these speakers to levels that hard rocking folks might demand.\nFolks who enjoy jazz, blues, chamber, folk, choral at sane listening levels will probably deem me a sadist for complaining, but Green Day, Zeppelin, Floyd, and Flea were merely \u201cgood\u201d when I pushed the CS-300x/Gibbon 3s.\nMozart and Dolphy were outstanding; the midrange resolution and presence made these speakers really excel with vocals and string instruments.\nEric Dolphy was a genius, and that genius made \u201cG.W.\u201d look almost smart through the Gibbon 3s. His Alto Sax and Bass Clarinet had bite without chewing one\u2019s head off.\nThe Gibbon 3s and CS-300x are a winning combination if you don\u2019t live on a diet of Pavement, Green Day, and Metallica at levels that even Lars would threaten to kick your ass for listening to music at. Strive for that emotional connection without going deaf.\nThe Shindo Labs Aurieges/Montille have wonderful resolution from top-to-bottom, and a slightly warm tonal balance, which also really complimented the immediate and open presentation of the Gibbon 3s. Unlike the Leben CS-300x, which ran out of gas at loud levels, the Montille seemed to take it more in stride and rolled off more gracefully.\nHank Mobley\u2019s \u201cBouncing with Bud\u201d and Lightnin\u2019 Hopkins\u2019 \u201cTake it Easy\u201d both offer their own unique challenges and the Gibbon 3s barely broke a sweat. I enjoyed both tracks at low and high listening levels thanks to the extraordinary detail retrieval and clarity. The speakers do not gloss over bad recordings, which will most likely annoy fans of over-produced formulaic schlock pop.\nGreat sounding pop such asDeparturefrom The Mammals, Winterpills\u2019 self-titled release, and Ruth Gerson\u2019sWake to Echokept me engaged for hours.\nMy NAD T753 and T763 surround receivers also worked rather well with the Gibbon 3s, supporting them with a lot more power, but the combination that I really enjoyed was the Gibbon 3s with the Arcam Solo (which I borrowed for a week).\nThe Solo (\u201cWhy you stuck up, scruffy lookin\u2026\u201d) was a 75 watt integrated amplifier/CD player/AM/FM tuner unit from Arcam that really blew the doors off with a speaker such as the Gibbon 3s.\nIt didn\u2019t quite have the detail retrieval or coherence of the Leben/Shindo Labs equipment, but the price differences were so enormous at the time (almost 50% less than the Leben and 75% less than the Shindo rig), that it was hard to ignore just how well the combination performed.\nRy Cooder\u2019sCh\u00e1vez Ravinewas my sleeper album of 2005, and its unique, dirty, gritty flavor oozed out of the Gibbon 3s like the bean and cheese from a good burrito. It burns your skin and stains like a mother on that new shirt you\u2019re wearing, but man is it good. The Solo had surprisingly fatcajonesfor a Brit piece of kit. The Gibbon 3s were from Brooklyn.\nKT Tunstall\u2019s \u201cBlack Horse and the Cherry Tree\u201d fromEyes to the Telescopehad a snappy beat to it and the Gibbon 3/Solo combination went along for the ride. Good album, gritty singer, great song to get drunk and start dancing to.\nMy only real complaint about the Gibbon 3s involve their sensitivity; they are not the easiest speakers to drive and that\u2019s a shame because I have no doubt that they would sound great with something like the Fi Super X, Almarro A205A MK II, etc\u2026which were more affordable than the Leben CS-300x and the Shindo Labs gear.\nIf you can find a pair today in excellent shape, they will work well with solid-state amplification that is slightly warmer sounding. Cambridge Audio, Rega, Arcam, McIntosh, Rotel, and older NAD amplifiers would be a great match as long as the power output is there.\nTheUnison Research Triode 25 Integrated Amplifierthat I reviewed last year would be superb with these loudspeakers but that is a rather hefty investment\nTheir superb coherence, punchy and immediate midrange, detailed and airy treble, superb imaging, and surprisingly deep bass response all add up to a complete package that is domestically friendly and a very mature sounding loudspeaker that I never should have sold.\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission.\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/dac-cambridge/",
        "content": "Getting lost in music is an act of vanishing, and if the ultimate goal of high-fidelity sound, vinyl culture and deep listening is to establish the clearest possible connection between the soundwaves that musicians made in the studio and your wide-open eardrums, it should hardly matter whether those waves arrive through analog, digital, carrier pigeon or some mystical signal generated by God herself.\nAs long as they make their way to the pleasure receptors, these missives in their purest form are format-neutral.\nOne convincing argument goes that embracing vinyl and hi-fi culture shouldn\u2019t require a whole-hog dismissal of digital music, especially considering that high-definition streaming and download services offer sound quality that greatly surpasses the dull, compressed thud of MP3s in the days of yore and the tinny sibilance of pre-2000 compact discs. Vinyl will always reign supreme for reasons too many to enumerate, but the truth is, if the sole intent is to allow your favorite artists\u2019 recordings to overtake you, when deep inside your favorite Lee \u201cScratch\u201d Perry, Autechre or Karen Dalton song you won\u2019t be thinking about the \u201chows\u201d of its source but so absorbed in the wonder of it all as to forgot such non-cosmic concerns.\nBefore we go any further and in the spirit of full disclosure, this post is about two products created by the British company Cambridge Audio, and was commissioned, in part, by them. ISC agreed to this effort, though, because long before the company reached out, the Cambridge Audio DACMagic 100 had already changed the way I think about 21st century listening and sound, and its machine expanded my world when the pandemic hit. Regardless, armed with the DAC, I found myself spending hours in my music room time-traveling to sonic realms in ways I\u2019d not before imagined.\nOne reason why LPs, cassettes and CDs are being snatched up by generations reared on music streaming, MP3s and instant YouTube gratification might be because this time three years ago we were collectively faced with\u00a0many, many hours of free time while starved of what to many of us was our lifeblood: live music. An experience that we all took for granted \u2013\u2013 spending uninterrupted, intentional time getting lost inside music at concerts or on dance floors \u2013\u2013 disappeared.\nSeeking alternative ways to scratch that itch, we rediscovered an endeavor that had faded with the rise of Walkmans, boomboxes, iPods and other portable music disrupters: sitting around and spending serious, uninterrupted time with physical music and committing to the intention that comes with dropping a needle or flipping the side. Not in the background. In the foreground. So it overtakes you and, ultimately, carries you away to some ethereal everywhere.\nOne vinyl clerk recently noted a trend that\u2019s apparent across the country: \u201cI was working at a record shop during the pandemic, and once we reopened, there was a whole new group of people who were like, \u2018I just got turned on to records. I\u2019m getting a soundsystem.\u2019\u201d\nPowering up the DAC and hearing high-def streaming for the first time was, to a certain extent, akin to cleaning smudged eyeglasses to reveal a forgotten, longed-for vibrancy.\nIn his epic bookOcean of Sound: Aether Talk, Ambient Sound and Imaginary Worlds,writer and musician David Toop contemplated the secret realm that reverberating soundwaves can create, one which many of us now visit on a regular basis and as often as possible. He noted that \u201cwhether the echoes are synthetic or natural \u2013\u2013 Jamaican dub, a North African call to dawn prayer shattering the early morning silence as it blasts out of a tower-mounted loudspeaker, Elvis Presley\u2019s \u2018Heartbreak Hotel\u2019 or a Javanese gamelan recorded under the high roof of a royal palace \u2013\u2013 there is no escaping their power to suggest actual, virtual and fantasy spaces.\u201d\nThe post-punk band Mekons called it \u201cthat secret place that we all want to go: rock and roll.\u201d David Berman of Purple Mountains described said \u201cvirtual and fantasy spaces\u201d this way:\nSongs build little rooms in timeAnd housed within the song\u2019s designIs the ghost the host has left behindTo greet and sweep the guest insideStoke the fire and sing his lines.\nAs long as you\u2019ve got keys to the \u201crooms in time,\u201d it makes little sense to reject non-analog sound signals that seek only to gratify you.\u00a0And so-called \u201cdeep listening sessions\u201d certainly don\u2019t require primo turntables and cartridges, tube amps or $10k speakers to have an effect, though we\u2019ll always argue that they can be remarkable enhancements.\nThough I already had a decent vintage set-up before the pandemic, in the thick of it I decided to use some government money to buy said digital to analog converter (DAC).\u00a0After doing a ton of research and reading countless reviews, I settled on a $200 DACMagic 100. At that point it was the only DAC I\u2019d ever used, though I\u2019ve since sampled a number of others at various listening sessions.\nPowering up the DAC and hearing high-def streaming for the first time was, to a certain extent, akin to cleaning smudged eyeglasses to reveal a forgotten, longed-for vibrancy. Where formerly I\u2019d outputted my Powerbook through a cheap digital-to-analog converter and plugged that via RCA jacks into an auxiliary input on my amplifier, the DACMagic spirited the digital signal of the Sun City Girls\u2019 formerly tinnyTorch of the Mysticsstream past the laptop\u2019s sound card, amplified, clarified, enhanced, beefed-up \u2013\u2013 pick your steroid-suggestive verb \u2013\u2013 the sound coming from Qobuz, Apple Music and Spotify to reveal recording depths otherwise only suggested. It was one of the best audio investments (about $200) I\u2019ve made in years.\nWhen, a few months ago, I raved about my DACMagic experience to Cambridge Audio\u2019s Matt Reilly, he graciously offered to ship me the company\u2019s luxurious DACMagic 200. Its main upgrade, among others, is a headphone jack that has enhanced my (Audio Technica) headphone experience just as the DACMagic 100 did with my vintage system (for reference, a Harman Kardon 730 twin powered amplifier and Large Advent speakers).\nDuring our call, Reilly discussed the company\u2019s range of offerings, all of which he described as meeting a current cultural desire to \u201cget us back in touch with the magic within music.\u201d He echoed that idea during aconversation with our friends at Aquarium Drunkard, describing \u201cthe escapism that can happen when you\u2019re taken away to another time or memory by a melody.\u00a0This can only happen when you fully embrace a song with no outside distractions. I imagine we will soon see lots of studies which show a ritualistic take of \u2018quality sound\u2019 as therapeutic exercise and a key well-being trend.\u201d\nIt stands to reason, because the thrill of being carried away is that ultimately you end up in a kind of Utopia. Here\u2019s Ryuichi Sakamoto talking to Toop about his version of this place:\n\u201cOne of my friends, he\u2019s a philosopher and critic. He made a word: outernationalism. Internationalism is still based on nationality. Being outernational is like Moses in the desert. There\u2019s no country. There is just trade, transportation, communication and merchants, but there\u2019s no nationality. It\u2019s a utopia and I like it.\u201d Though he forgot to mention art and/or music, he added, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be Japanese. I want to be a citizen of the world. It sounds very hippie but I like that.\u201d During that time (the late \u201980s or early \u201990s), Sakamoto would include a then-new-fangled technology among his performance gear and send border-penetrating missives in real time.\nWitnessing one of these concerts in the \u201990s, Toop realized that \u201ctechnology can reduce live performance to an anachronism. In the past decade, computers have delivered cybernetic music into realms which reach beyond human capabilities. For example, a concert stage in London: Ryuichi Sakamoto is faxing messages to friends around the globe during \u2018Rap the World,\u2019 a song in which machines do more of the work than the humans.\u201d\n(To riff on Toop\u2019s thought, it\u2019s not just technology that can upend live performance. A pandemic, we now understand, can also reduce live performance to an anachronism, or at least reconfigure it.)\nTo conclude on what may or may not be a non sequitur about the act of receiving clear messages from That Secret Place, Pauline Oliveros recalled the genesis of her phrase \u201cdeep listening\u201d in Toop\u2019s book, one that resonates on any number of levels when discussing the transformative nature of both recorded and live performance. She recalled in 1988 recording in a \u201cbig cistern\u201d in order to release a compact disc of the music.\n\u201cWhen I was trying to write the liner notes, I was trying to come to some conclusion about what it was we were actually doing in there. The two words came together \u2013 deep listening \u2013 because it\u2019s a very challenging space to create music in, when you have forty-five seconds reverberation coming back at you. The sound is so well mirrored, so to speak, that it\u2019s hard to tell direct sound from the reflective sound.\u201d\nShe continued of experiencing sound in a cistern, \u201cIt puts you in the deep listening space. You\u2019re hearing the past, of sound that you made; you\u2019re continuing it, possibly, so you\u2019re right in the present, and you\u2019re anticipating the future, which is coming at you from the past.\u201d\nMay we all luxuriate such a heavenly place.\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "title": "Audiophile Jazz Vinyl Pressings: Exit to Vintage Street",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/audiophile-jazz-vinyl/",
        "content": "A big bone of contention in audiophile circles is which stage of the audio system chain is most important. By extension, where an individual places priority \u2013 source, amplification, or loudspeakers dictates the percentage of the available budget devoted to each.\nA large group will argue that loudspeakers are most important as they produce the sound reaching our ears; if the speakers are not very good, the music won\u2019t be delivered properly and won\u2019t sound right. Now, what\u2019s \u201cright\u201d is subjective \u2013 some prefer more visceral bass, a warmer sounding midrange, greater detail, and no two loudspeakers are created equal sound signature wise \u2013 but there certainly is something to the argument that speakers are the most important.\nPerhaps a smaller group will argue that amplification is more important. Here you\u2019ll find discussion around the ability of an amplifier (power/preamp separates or all-in-one integrated amplifier) to convert the signal from the source without distortion, around tube versus solid-state, and around power output and the ability to drive different speaker technologies, sensitivities, and impedances.\nThen there\u2019s the set who highlight the importance of cables and interconnects, but I\u2019m not touching that one.\nAnd finally, another large grouping will insist that source is paramount. If they stream, it\u2019ll be all about the quality of the DAC (Digital to Analog Converter). If their source of choice is CD or SACD, it\u2019ll be the combination of transport and DAC (separates or combined in a single unit). And for vinyl, it\u2019ll be turntable and cartridge, and perhaps even stylus.\nThe thinking here is \u201cgarbage in, garbage out\u201d (GIGO), or the opposite \u201cmagic in, magic out;\u201d if you can ensure the quality of what you feed the system, you increase the chance that what comes out will sound incredible. Again, some solid logic here.\nPersonally, I take a whole-system approach. I side with both the speaker and source sets, but believe all stages are important, and improvements in one stage will eventually require improvements or changes in others.\nNew speakers may dictate a more powerful integrated or power amp, or addition of tubes for synergy. Shifting from a moving magnet (MM) phono cartridge to moving coil (MC) may necessitate a better phono stage, or even a Step-up Transformer (SUT) for low-output MC cartridges.\nOn the vinyl source side though, there\u2019s a step beyond cartridge and stylus that deserves more attention, and that is the vinyl itself. There is a growing awareness of vinyl and mastering quality, and a growing penetration of \u201caudiophile vinyl\u201d in the market. Mastering engineers like Kevin Gray, Ryan Smith, Bernie Grundman, Ron McMaster, Doug Sax and Steve Hoffman, and studios like Cohearent Audio and Sterling Sound have become household names in audiophile circles for the quality of their remasters.\nIn the last few years, one of the most successful labels in this category has been Blue Note with theirTone Poet series, which was introduced in 2019 to celebrate the company\u2019s 80thanniversary, and features all-analog, 180 gram audiophile vinyl reissues mastered from the original master tapes.\nThe Tone Poet Series has been huge for Blue Note. For long-time jazz freaks, new releases have been an opportunity to fill in holes in the collection with titles never released on vinyl or long out-of-print (and expensive on secondary markets), or to replace well loved, worn out original or early pressings with fresh, super-charged updates.\nFor many younger vinyl fans, Tone Poet albums \u2013 not much more expensive than \u201cregular\u201d records \u2013 have been a combined point of entry to jazz, Blue Note, and audiophile recordings. These fans buy Tone Poet releases partly because they\u2019re budget friendly, but mostly because they sound incredible. Store owners talk of spinning new titles, customers rushing the counter to ask what\u2019s playing, and purchases immediately being made.\nNew releases sell out quickly, but the word on the street is that all titles will eventually be repressed; this makes me happy as I was a bit late to the party and missed some of the early releases. Facebook groups devoted to Tone Poets have sprung up with avid discussion on favorites and speculation on future releases.\nMitch Anderson and I recently did apodcast\u00a0with Mastering Engineer Kevin Gray, and Producer Joe Harley. If you haven\u2019t given this one a listen, you owe it to yourself to do so. Kevin and Joe gave insights on a variety of topics, including how the Tone Poet sound came to be and how mastering and selection are done.\nWhat caught my attention was when they spoke of their initial plan for Tone Poet to reproduce as closely as possible the sound of the original album pressings, and their surprise at how much additional information (bass, detail, soundstage) came through from the first few master tapes they received.\nApparently, Rudy Van Gelder applied significant compression in transferring tapes to pressings to create records that didn\u2019t skip on the turntables of the \u201850s and \u201860s (and thus avoid customers returning unplayable albums).\nTurntable and cartridge tracking advances since that time mean skipping is less of an issue, so the decision was made to reproduce the sound of the master tapes as opposed to the original pressings, and that is why this series has such amazing body and impact, and why listeners have responded so positively to each release.\nThere are numerous other audiophile vinyl companies out there as well, many of which have been around a lot longer than Tone Poet.\nMobile Fidelity Sound Labs(aka MFSL or MoFi) got its start in the late \u201850s with novelty recordings. In 1977, they began producing the Original Master Recordings reissues, recorded with their half-speed mastering process from original master tapes and pressed on heavyweight, virgin \u201csupervinyl.\u201d They have been owned by Music Direct since 2001.\nMobile Fidelity records come in two styles. Early releases were cut at the traditional 33.3 rpm, but recent releases have been offered on multiple records at 45 rpm. With the higher speed of 45 rpm, record grooves are \u201clonger\u201d and can hold more detailed information, theoretically delivering better sound quality (which more often than not they do).\nThe downside of this higher speed is that a single record side can\u2019t hold as much music, hence a typical album becoming a two-record release, and the listener having to flip the record every 8-12 minutes instead of the more typical 20-plus.\nMoFi don\u2019t just focus on jazz. Some of their classic rock releases by artists like Steely Dan, Pink Floyd, Supertramp, Bob Dylan and Donald Fagen are highly sought after and command huge prices on the secondary market due to a lack of recent represses. Other artists and titles have seen multiple represses over the years \u2013 like the bulk of the Dire Straits catalog which sounds a lot better on these remastered pressings but still puts a hit on the wallet.\nThere have been numerous jazz albums released by Mobile Fidelity, the best known being reissues of Miles Davis\u2019 Columbia Records catalog, and in particular,Kind of Bluefor which the MoFi pressing has been the reference for many years.\nIn 2016, MoFi created a new, ultra-premium series calledUltradisc One-Step. These are released in very limited numbers, pressed at 45 rpm on 180 gram premium vinyl, and housed in elaborate box sets. Bill Evans\u2019Sunday at the Village VanguardandPortrait in Jazz, andMonk\u2019s Dreamby Thelonious Monk have all had the One-Step treatment, but good luck finding copies and be prepared to sell a body part to get one. Audiophiles will spend north of $200 on any of these titles, and more on the secondary market.\nAnalogue Productions(AP) is the in-house audiophile label of Acoustic Sounds. It was founded in 1992 by music fan and entrepreneur Chad Kassem in Salina, Kansas. Early releases were pressed in California and Germany, but in 2011 Kassem launched his own state-of-the-art pressing plant, Quality Record Pressings (QRP).\nLike MoFi, Analogue Productions masters from original analogue master tapes. Exceptions are made for albums of rare quality recorded digitally in the CD era. All are pressed on 180 gram or 200 gram vinyl. Many AP reissues have been released in both 33.3 and 45 rpm formats, though some are one or the other.\nEither way, they sound incredible, and a generation of music lovers has benefitted enormously from Kassem\u2019s business acumen and selections; case in point, his decision to promote numerous forgotten blues musicians who never before reached a large, global audience. The quality of the recordings and attention to detail in the pressings makes them a very worthwhile addition to any music library.\nAnalogue Productions have put out over 300 reissues, with a large proportion of their catalogue being jazz from the big labels like Blue Note, Prestige, Fantasy, Impulse, Verve, Columbia and Riverside. Recent releases have come primarily from Verve and Impulse, perhaps due to other labels like Blue Note and Concord seeing market growth and taking their audiophile reissues in-house.\nLike MoFi, Analogue Productions has introduced an ultra-premium reissue series of its own called UHQR (or Ultra High Quality Recording). I haven\u2019t heard it yet, but reportedly theUHQR ofKind of Blue(I have two on order) takes the mantle as the new reference recording away from the MoFi. This will be a series to watch with great interest.\nOwned by Concord,Craft Recordingswas founded in 2017 as a reissue vehicle for the Concord catalog, which includes legacy labels like Fantasy, Milestone, Prestige, Riverside, Vee Jay and others. Their catalog is extensive and growing; including numerous reissues of classic albums from Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Sonny Rollins, Thelonious Monk, Bill Evans and Chet Baker. A recent limited-edition, ultra-premium reissue ofColtrane\u2019sLush Lifesold outon their online store within minutes of release.\nImpexis a newer audiophile label from the team that previously ran Cisco Music, itself a respected reissue label, which closed shop in 2008. The Impex catalog is relatively small, but they have reissued some amazing jazz albums, including the classic liveFriday Night in San Franciscoby Al Di Meola, Paco de Lucia and John McLaughlin (33.3 and 45 rpm versions), and several reissues from the famous Three Blind Mice J-Jazz label; theThree Blind Mice 45 Boxwill blow your socks off.\nBarely Breaking Even(BBE) is another reissue label that has done a lot of Japanese Jazz reissues, both of full albums, and their excellent compilation series,J Jazz: Deep Modern Jazz from Japanwhich is now up to Volume 3.\nOther audiophile reissue labels to look out for includeOriginal Recordings Group(ORG),Pure Pleasure,Speakers Corner,Music Matters(Joe Harley\u2019s Blue Note reissue project before he moved to Tone Poet), and Classic Records (now taken over by Acoustic Sounds, but worth buying on the used market). There are certainly other labels I haven\u2019t covered here, and I\u2019d love to hear about them in the comments or via Instagram at@audioloveyyc.\nIf you haven\u2019t yet ventured into audiophile vinyl and want to get more from your system without upgrades, then check out some of these labels and recordings; you\u2019ll be impressed. And if you\u2019re already sold, look out for some of the less prominent labels and give them a try; there are some real gems out there.\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission.\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/best-budget-hi-fi-speakers-2023/",
        "content": "We don\u2019t need to tell our readership that inflation has had a huge impact on hi-fi sales over the past 15 months. Coming out of the pandemic where consumers spent a lot of money on TVs, wireless headphones, soundbars, and turntables, manufacturers are currently struggling to get people to buy. For those looking for a new pair of loudspeakers in 2023, there are some rather good options if funds are tight. The best budget hi-fi speakers of 2023 features some rather well known brands and a few outliers that might not be on your radar.\nBookshelf or stand-mounted loudspeakersare evolving and while the movement is in the direction of wireless loudspeakers, there is still no shortage of excellent and affordable passive bookshelf options right now. My favorite budget bookshelf loudspeakers of 2023 feature a wide range of options.\nNot everyone has the space or budget forfloorstanding loudspeakersand there are also a growing number of consumers who have not heeded the RTO charge from their employers and continue to work from home and desire something for the desktop or their office.\nNone of these loudspeakers priced below $499 will break the bank, but don\u2019t forget that almost all of them will benefit from using higher quality amplification; either an existing amplifier that you might own, or something from our list of integrated amplifiers.\nBuilding a system is a process and it\u2019s not a bad move to find a pair of loudspeakers and amplifier that you prefer before blowing the rest of your budget on sources and cables.\nI can hear the laughter around the globe, but 99% of you have never listened to the original Dayton Audio B652 or the B652-AIR that utilizes a 1\u2033 x 1\u2033 mini AMT tweeter with surprisingly good results.\nJust how good can a $60 USD pair of loudspeakers be?\nThe black ebony pica vinyl cabinet isn\u2019t winning any industrial design awards but were you really expecting a pair of Sonus faber Amati for $60?\nThe 6.5-inch woofer offers relatively robust bass considering the size of the sealed cabinet and the 87 dB sensitivity (6 ohms) makes these rather easy to drive. The roll-off below 70Hz is rather noticeable, but that makes them a great candidate for an inexpensive subwoofer or as a pair of loudspeakers in a bedroom or on the desktop.\nThe treble can be somewhat peaky on the B652, but we did not find that to be the case with the AMT tweeter which is smoother sounding, and far more detailed.\nA vintage receiver would drive the hell out of these fun loudspeakers and a warmer tonal balance would certainly be preferable.\nWhere to buy:$60/pairat Parts Express\nThe new C3GM bookshelf loudspeakers replace the best-selling CG3 that were discontinued in 2022 and it\u2019s almost impossible to find a better pair of loudspeakers at the price; RSL sells all of their products direct to consumers and there is enormous value here for $120 USD/pair.\nThe C3GM work well on both stands or a desktop; the loudspeakers do not take up a lot of space (9.5\u201dH x 5.3\u2033D x 6.7\u201dW) and there is a keyhole mount for those who might wish to mount them on a wall and use them as rear channel speakers.\nThe 4-inch mineral-filled woven aramid fiber cone\u00a0woofer and 1-inch silk dome tweeter offer a fairly robust sound, but there is noticeable roll-off around 90Hz making these ideal candidate for a subwoofer.\nThe 86.5 dB (6 ohms) sensitivity is on the lower side but they will work just fine with 30-50 watts; and they certainly won\u2019t implode if you drive them with 100 to 125 watts of power either.\nA clean sounding pair of bookshelf loudspeakers with above average detail and speed considering the entry-level price tag.\nWhere to buy:$210/pairat RSL\nAndrew Jones set the entry-level category ablaze a few years ago when he was tasked with creating something that audiophiles could sink their teeth into for less than $400. Not only did the acclaimed loudspeaker designer build out a rather impressive niche for the brand, he forced the competition to rethink what could be done for very little. Jones has moved on to MoFi \u2014 but we still have the Elac Debut 2.0 B5.2 to recommend for less than $300 depending on where you find them.\nThe 86 dB sensitivity rating (6 ohms) might feel like it\u2019s on the low side but this is one pair of bookshelf loudspeakers than can work with a rather wide range ofamplifiersandAVRs.\nThe 5.25-inch woven aramid fiber bass driver and 1-inch soft-dome tweeter delivers deep impactful bass and rather smooth and extended top end performance that makes these suitable for both music and movies.\nIf you have to place the Debut 2.0 B5.2 close to the wall behind them, Jones wisely put the bass ports on the front of the cabinet allowing for greater flexibility when it comes to room placement.\nThe 46Hz \u2013 35kHz frequency response is rather accurate and you would be surprised just how deep these bookshelf loudspeakers can go with the right amplifier.\nWe don\u2019t love the black ash vinyl finish, but the MDF cabinet is extensively braced and these are rather well built for the money. Elac sold a lot of these because they are cohesive sounding, detailed, and far more expressive than the average entry-level loudspeaker.\nWhere to buy:$330/pairat ELAC\nThe Triangle Borea BR03 BT made our \u201cBest Wireless Speakers of 2022\u201d list and after 2 months with them \u2014 I\u2019m certainly buying them when the tax refund check arrives in February.\nThe passive version are even more impressive and less than 50% of the price which makes them one of the easiest recommendations of 2023. The Borea BR03 are rather agile sounding loudspeakers, although I do wish that the 1-inch silk dome tweeter was slightly better behaved depending on the amplifier.\nThe 6.2-inch woofer has more than enough extension and scale to make orchestral and classic rock selections come alive in my 16\u2032 x 13\u2032 x 9\u2032 den.\nClarity, detail, and a rather high level of resolution makes these one of our favorite loudspeakers on the list because they really respond well to integrated amplifiers in the $650 to $1,500 range and you would never guess how affordable they are.\nThe 90 dB sensitivity (4 ohms) is slightly deceptive and we would suggest 50 watts as a minimum to really give these vibrant loudspeakers the foundation they need. Triangle has a done a great job with the Borea range and these are still flying under the radar for most people which we find a tad strange.\nWhere to buy:$300/pairat Adorama\nVery much like Jason Statham\u2019s character inLock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, the Q Acoustics 3020i are a tad unleashed. They communicate music like an effortless weapon, and with some serious punch in the lower registers with the right amplifier. They borrow some of their driver technology from their much larger sibling; theQ Acoustics 3050i floor-standing loudspeakerthat retails for almost three times the price.\nQ Acoustics have tweaked something in the cabinet design and crossover of the 3020i making it hit much harder than one would expect considering the size of the cabinet and drivers.\nThe 3020i s not a very difficult loudspeaker to drive (88 dB, 6 ohms) but it definitely benefits from an amplifier with some grip and midrange punch. Stay away from amps that veer dark because the 1-inch soft-dome tweeter needs some illumination.\nAvailable in Graphite Grey, English Walnut, Carbon Black or Arctic White. All are finished with an attractive chrome bezel around each driver and feature magnetic speaker grilles.\nDitch the grille covers and do not use the foam bungs even if you need to place them closer to the wall; the mid bass and lower midrange loses some of clarity in the process. The price has increased over the past 12 months which is a shame because these are very fine loudspeakers.\nWhere to buy:$449/pairat Paducah Home Theater\nTherevised AE100 MK2(also referred to as MKII or AE1002) from Acoustic Energy are a very balanced sounding bookshelf loudspeaker with fantastic build quality and excellent punch. They might not be the last word in the lower registers but they can still deliver the goods for only $399 USD.\nFor more information: Read ourAE100 MK2 Review.\nWhere to buy:$399/pair at Sound Seller LLC|\u00a3259/pair at Audio Affair\nThe Diamond series receives a facelift every 3-4 years, and the newDiamond 12 seriesproducts are already proving to be a massive hit.\nWharfedale understands that most consumers don\u2019t have a lot of space and are working within a very specific budget when buying a hi-fi system.\nThere are specific brands of electronics that work exceptionally well with Wharfedale\u2019s loudspeakers; Audiolab, Croft, Marantz, Cambridge Audio, Quad, Rega, and NAD.\nThe Wharfedale Diamond 12.1\u2019s are the ideal size for a desktop loudspeaker or placement on a credenza in a home office scenario.\nThese stand-mounters are a two-way, bass-reflex\u00a0design. The\u00a05-inch mid/bass driver\u00a0uses a polypropylene/mica composite cone material, and the tweeter is a 1-inch textile dome design that offers a very smooth sounding top end and excellent dispersion.\nWhere to buy:$449/pairat Wharfedale\nThe Danish manufacturer is now distributed by Lenbrook in N. America and that situation makes them much easier to find. DALI makes excellent loudspeakers across the board but their affordable Spektor 2 is a fantastic value and wonderful platform for a wide range of amplifiers.\nThe Spektor 2 offer an insightful, detailed, and very expressive presentation. They are not overly fussy about placement, but they can be rather underwhelming with low powered amplifiers. Anything above 50 watts per channel should be quite sufficient.\nWhere to buy:$499/pairat Music Direct\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission.\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "title": "Dante\u2019s HiFi Sound \u2013 LoFi Approach with Rich Medina",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/dantes-hifi-rich-medina/",
        "content": "In the fall of \u201822, we flew to Miami, the Magic City, after learning of a new kind of listening bar that had emerged in the city\u2019s Wynwood neighborhood. Co-founded by a team of nightlife veterans alongside legendary DJ, spoken word artist, journalist, and producerRich Medina,Dante\u2019s HiFiis the city\u2019s first jazz-kissa-inspired listening bar \u2013\u2013 and unlike any other hi-fi bar we\u2019ve visited in either the United States or Japan.\nEquipped with a custom-built analog sound system featuring Klipsch speakers, vintage Cary tube amplification, and Master Sounds rotary, Dante\u2019s serves up \u201chifi sound with a lofi approach\u201d to a Miami crowd typically accustomed to bottle service and pounding club music. Their unique take on the \u201clistening room\u201d puts equal emphasis on listening, dance music, DJ culture, and music education. During our visit, the night flowed naturally from full album-sides of jazz classics to DJ sets featuring a mix of latin music, disco, boogie, and house with one of the residents picking up the mic at various points to interact with the crowd. Somehow, everyone in the room knew exactly what to do at all times throughout the night.\nMedina, the music director, master of ceremonies, and originator of this new approach to the listening room, was out of town during our visit, but his presence was made known through the 10,000 records from the Lakewood-born, NYC-raised DJ\u2019s personal collection housed behind the bar.\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing\u2019s Phil Cho recently caught up with Medina to learn more about the bar\u2019s ethos, musical roots, education in a jazz kissa context, Miami\u2019s music scene, and Dante\u2019s constantly evolving music program.\nHey Rich! To start\u2026 Miami\u2019s music scene is, of course, very club focused. How did the idea first come together to create a spot that was dedicated to listening and sound?\nA few years ago, my partners went to Japan and really experienced jazz kissa culture for the first time. They had been to them in the past, but never went with the specific intention to understand what the culture was about. After a couple days of going to as many kissas as possible, they convinced themselves that they wanted to open one in Miami.\nMy three other partners are all successful venue owners and/or entrepreneurs already, so they have a vocabulary about how these things work, but there was a missing player with who was going to represent the brand musically so that we don\u2019t move too far away from the Japanese tradition, but also put a thing on it that makes it uniquely ours. That\u2019s where I entered the conversation. After months of Zooms, looking at CAD drawings, talking about the business, and all of that, next thing I know I\u2019m packing up my shit and on my way to Florida. They\u2019re the right guys for the opportunity. Praise God that the call came my way. I feel like I\u2019m the right guy for the job to finish off that team. It\u2019s been fantastic.\nEducation seems to be a key element of the Dante\u2019s Hi-Fi experience along with having an MC (master of ceremonies). Can you talk about your background as an MC and how that culture/history informs Dante\u2019s?\nMy background as an MC goes all the way back to my grandfather\u2019s church and growing up in a space of men of the cloth (preachers, deacons, reverends) and particular teachers who made it a point to me as a young child to recognize that I have a way of making a point. You tell a kid they got something and then you nurture it and you let the kid run with it. If the kid really loves it, it\u2019s just the water out of the faucet.\nI\u2019m 53, so I grew up in the \u201870s and \u201880s forty minutes south of Manhattan. I\u2019m a member of the Zulu nation. I\u2019m a member of the Rocksteady crew. I\u2019ve been B-boying my whole life. Whether it\u2019s MC-ing from a secular hip-hop disposition, or reggae disposition, or the church, or the school assembly, I\u2019ve always had a thing for orators and people who can bring an idea to you that you never heard before. They make you feel like you get it a little bit and inspire you to leave and go do your own recon on it to see if it\u2019s for you or not.\nMy relationship with MC-ing is deeply rooted. I\u2019ve also been a writer, writing for magazines, decades of poetry performances, and all of those things. With Dante\u2019s, I now have a place where all that work and experience has someplace really redeeming to come home to roost. Then, when you apply it to the jazz kissa culture, it\u2019s a new audience. Damn near everybody under the sun here is a new audience to that game.\nIf you can share music with the right humility and make eye contact with the right new person in the room, you know that you got somebody in front of you that\u2019s probably going to be in a record store in the next 48 hours.\nFor people that have never been to the bar, can you take us through how you incorporate the educational aspect into a typical bar night?\nIt could be anything. I could stop the music, talk about who we are and how long we\u2019ve been here, ask the room how many people are here for the first time, give them a quick bullet-point breakdown of who we are, what the inspiration for the place comes from, express our appreciation for them coming in to rock with us, and get back to playing music. I could play a song and stop the record and tell you why this record is so important to me. \u201cI got this record in San Francisco ten years ago for $5. Now it goes for $300 on Discogs because of X-Y-Z whatever.\u201d Just data about the music.\nIf you\u2019re into music or you\u2019re listening to music, you\u2019re at least curious who the artist is. If you\u2019re listening to music in an analog way, you\u2019re probably reading the liner notes. You start to become this active piece of liner notes for people. Liner notes for what the culture is about in general and what our intent is within the culture. Pioneering that type space within the kissa culture has been vital to satisfying people\u2019s curiosities about what exactly this is.\nSo it seems like you approach it as a free-flowing conversation?\nFor me it\u2019s free flowing because I\u2019ve been MC-ing my own parties as a resident DJ across the span of my career. The parties that I grew up with were steeped in the old school tradition. Coke La Rock and Kool Herc\u2026 \u201cThrow your hands in the air, wave them like you just don\u2019t care.\u201d The people that did that, the people on the other side of that statement that actually put their hands in the air and waved them like they didn\u2019t fucking care. Those are the motherfuckers you\u2019re talking to. That\u2019s the root of the tree. They\u2019re the ones that make the wall flowers loosen up. You can\u2019t do with records what the guy standing next to the stiff guy can do with a physical reaction. So it\u2019s the truth in the engagement of the community.\nWe\u2019re not up there telling you what to do or dictating to you how things are going to be. Your energy, what you think, and how you see this space is important too. We want you to know that in this space, we acknowledge how smart you are musically because even if you don\u2019t know any of these records, you\u2019re smart enough to know to stick around because you\u2019re going to hear something you like or know soon enough.\nI was in Philly for the last 30 years, so it\u2019s Cash Money and Marvelous. It\u2019s Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince. It\u2019s all the Notorious forward DJs in Philadelphia who became touring DJs always having an emcee, not a rapper, a master of ceremonies. So it\u2019s tradition from the crib, as well. Taking New York, Philly and Jersey and implanting that energy here in Miami. It stands out because we\u2019re not there, we\u2019re in Florida. Bringing that seasoned club disposition to the table inside of a hi-fi bar \u2013 it\u2019s bulletproof if you execute it with the right intent.\nEverybody that you come across in the room is the most important guy in the room. Talk to people with respect. Keep it simple, keep it pushing. Avoid the goofy shit.\nEven being there just one night, I could feel there were people around who came specifically to listen and learn.\nMy thing is, I\u2019ll tell you what the record is, where it\u2019s from, what it costs, then it\u2019s good luck from there\u2026 It also allows the line to remain drawn as well, but the only line is professional vs. hobbyist, and even that isn\u2019t a greater-than-less-than conversation, it\u2019s just the delta. Right? To make the hobbyist intrigued by the in-depth considerations that we make with regard to the records and how a room sounds \u2013 it becomes like a bottomless pit of sharing. If you can share music with the right humility and make eye contact with the right new person in the room, you know that you got somebody in front of you that\u2019s probably going to be in a record store in the next 48 hours.\nThey\u2019ve never seen or held a record in their whole life, and now it\u2019s stuck to them. It\u2019s like they\u2019re seeing an elephant inside of a building in America, and thinking, \u201cwhat is going on here?\u201d Then that guy is back the next week and the week after and he\u2019s got this look on his face like, \u201cYeah, okay, you played a record by so and so and I researched it on my phone and I went to some record store a couple of blocks from here. They had all these records made by this artist. It was so great.\u201d\nI have these conversations with people that are new to digging all the time now. That\u2019s just priceless, man. I mean, there\u2019s something to be said for keeping some things to yourself at times, but in an environment like ours, we want to lift that veil like the information is there for you, too. All you gotta do is want it.\nI love Dante\u2019s tagline \u201cHIFI SOUND / LOFI APPROACH\u201d Can you elaborate on this philosophy?\nWe serve you craft cocktails and we present you craft music. The \u201clo-fi\u201d part just means treating the place as precious as it should be treated, but to not be precious about it. Everybody that you come across in the room is the most important guy in the room. Talk to people with respect. Keep it simple, keep it pushing. Avoid the goofy shit. So that\u2019s \u201clo-fi.\u201d That humility of approach means that we are a watering hole forallmusic lovers, from the most experienced to the most inexperienced. If you have questions, somebody within three bodies of you can help you get to the answer that you\u2019re looking for.\nIf you\u2019re the person that wants the optics of being seen, the people who are running the place are personable enough that, as long as you approach them with some etiquette, you\u2019re going to get an exchange. So if the intent is to share information and the intent is to enjoy this experience together. It\u2019s not the servers versus the clientele. It all works together. Keeping that out in front of the intent has done wonders for us in terms of the way people talk about us and why.\nThe hi-fi heads that frequent our site will definitely be curious about the sound system, so I gotta ask: What makes up the system at Dante\u2019s? I especially loved the care and small details put into the DJ booth.\nLooking at the schedule, it\u2019s clear that the selection at Dante\u2019s is meant to be diverse and the DJs focus on all genres of music. Can you talk about a few of the zones you guys have explored recently in terms of music selection/selectors? Any favorite regular nights?\nAs music director, it\u2019s been a blessing to be able to bring all my experience to the place. I bring in all types of guest selectors, explain what we do, and they come in there and it really swings them back. They really feel happy about being there. They feel appreciative that there\u2019s a space where they feel like the music director is not trying to be a program director and tell them what to play. The music director brought me here because they like what I do, or they want to give me a shot. Both of those people have room here.\nIn terms of special nights, man, it\u2019s so much stuff. I mean, Dave Chappelle coming in town and calling us on a Monday night, asking if we can open up. He\u2019s like, \u201cEverybody\u2019s been to Dante\u2019s but me!\u201d We were sitting there for two and a half hours, Dave Chappelle and I on a freestyle. Just Dave Chappelle talking shit. It was fucking amazing. For the residencies, there\u2019s Ladies Night, Record Shop Sessions, Holy Smoke (gospel & spiritual jazz), La Cura (latin diaspora), Dvize, Lumin, and Marcello Bentine\u2019s Brazilian Sessions, Rum & Coke (tropicalia). I don\u2019t want to leave anyone out, but it\u2019s just been a constant barrage of exciting moments because at any given night, there might be somebody on the bill that nobody really knows yet, and they might be playing the earlier slot of the night, but they\u2019re a fucking wizard in the box.\nSometimes you get a big name in the room that\u2019s playing at peak time, and they\u2019re a little bit nervous on the rotary. You watch somebody very established who\u2019s used to play in big rooms and big arenas, and you give them an intimate environment like ours where people are right on top of you and it\u2019s a whole different kind of pressure. It\u2019s a whole different kind of animal to fight. So it\u2019s hard to call out all the highlights.\nArt Basel this year was probably the biggest impact moment for us yet. We had two systems set up the whole week, outside in the courtyard and inside the bar. So having that outdoor ignited with 9th Wonder, Digging Through The Crates, Alize, B-Sharp, Dvize, Lumin, Quantic, J Rocc, Maceo, Louie Vega, Osunlade. It was an unbelievable week, but yeah day to day it\u2019s always something\u2026\nOne night, I walked in the room at 7:30 and one of the bartenders was brave enough to get the ladder and pull a couple records out of a shelf they\u2019d been staring at. They\u2019re playing something in the room that I haven\u2019t played in five years that\u2019s a banger. It\u2019s a go-to joint in my mind, but I haven\u2019t touched it in years. So it comes across the whole bell curve whether it\u2019s somebody who comes through the door, a song that comes through the speaker, or just a person who came in here who looked unhappy and then 30 minutes later they\u2019re smiling with a drink and rocking to the music.\nHow has the city responded to this new type of music space?\nI think that we\u2019ve impacted the club culture in Miami in a very positive way. You asked me about the \u201clo-fi approach\u201d earlier. Just being sophisticated, approachable, and simple at the same time has kind of taken people aback a little bit because they come expecting club energy. They come expecting the beach club, and we\u2019re nothing like that. You feel like you\u2019re walking into a speakeasy somewhere deep in Brooklyn. You don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re in Miami. You feel like you could be anywhere because it\u2019s something that you haven\u2019t experienced in the city before. We\u2019ve been getting that energy from people in government to local police to patrons to other businesses that surround us physically on our block. We\u2019ve brought bodies to an area of Wynwood that didn\u2019t really have that type of traffic for a very long time. Also, when you\u2019re inside of the development or gentrification machine, and you\u2019re actually doing something culturally redeeming, you don\u2019t feel so bad about being there.\nLastly, we love sharing as much music as possible in our articles\u2026 Can you share five records you\u2019ve played recently at Dante\u2019s?\nDante\u2019s HiFi:https://danteshifi.com/\nRich Medina:https://richmedina.com/\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "content": "It\u2019s true. Those wanting to better understand stereo reproduction, find the most desirable gear, learn how seminal audio products by Acoustic Research, Klipsch, Garrard, and Pioneer were contemporaneously reviewed, and luxuriate in design-rich advertisements for nearly every notable stereo component since the birth of hi-fi audio in the 1950s need only do an online search to find troves of fascinating information. The best archive isWorld Radio History. Despite its clumsy web design, its database is filled with dozens of magazine titles devoted to music\u2013\u2013whether making it, recording it, listening to it or assessing it.\nTake, for example, the 1950s magazineAudiocraft. An early maker\u2019s magazine written for amateur audiophiles interested in building their own stereo amplifiers and speakers, it offers wildly informative tips on everything from basic electronics and tonearm weighting to speaker placement and the pros and cons of contour controls. Are you a speaker buff interested in building a rear-loading corner horn enclosure? Good news: TheMarch 1958 issuehas an easy-to-follow how-to. (See above.)\nOr this fascinating tidbit: Editors experimented with speaker placement, assessing sound quality in a blind listening test. (The surprising result is identified in the caption.)\nHigh Fidelitymagazine was published for nearly 50 years. It offered a fount of information about listening, fidelity, and audio engineering. Best, because it was geared toward a mass market audience discovering the wonder of hi-fi listening and stereo reproduction, the magazine\u2019s articles and various explainers were written in relatively clear language. The publication blossomed in the 1960s.\nIn 1972, audio expert William Boyce published an updated edition of hisHi-Fi Stereo Handbook, which he original wrote in 1957 and also updated in \u201961 and \u201967. Next time you\u2019ve got a few hours to spare, read it. You\u2019ll come away with a much deeper understanding of audio, sound, and listening strategies.\nThe 1970s were boom times for component manufacturers, as competition from emergent Japanese manufacturers created a kind of arms race.

        "title": "The Rebirth of Mirage Loudspeakers?",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/the-rebirth-of-mirage-loudspeakers/",
        "content": "If you are old enough to remember\u00a0Mirage\u00a0Loudspeakers (or follow \u201980s vintage hi-fi) \u2014 this might prove to be very exciting news. Over the weekend, we were alerted by industry insiders that Premium Audio Company (PAC) COO, Oscar Bernardo, was leaving the company to relaunch Mirage.\nDo you remember the storied Canadian brand that was eventually acquired by Audio Products International?\nBose tried to acquire Mirage prior to the API purchase but it never came to fruition.\nMirage was started back in 1979 by Jeff Percy, Jeff Soltysek, and Patrick Dempster. What a lot of audiophiles probably don\u2019t know is that famed loudspeaker designer, Kevin Voecks (Revel, Snell Acoustics), created the original Mirage loudspeaker designs.\nThe first few years for Mirage were focused on rather high quality, but affordable two-way loudspeakers that did relatively well in the marketplace.\nVoecks, who owned another loudspeaker company in the United States, sold that business and moved to Toronto to become the lead designer at Mirage.\nThe aforementioned Bose acquisition fell through when the Toronto group realized that it would mean that the company would be relocated to Massachusetts and there wasn\u2019t a lot of support for that internally.\nThe brand was fortunate to secure private financing to expand its manufacturing capabilities and develop a proper dealer network in the United States; something that became a problem when demand outstripped their ability to create product fast enough after a series of very positive reviews in the high-end press.\nToo much success has killed more than a few high-end brands which lacked the ability to scale up their operations.\nThe Mirage M-1 Loudspeakers were the pinnacle of their design philosophy and a huge success.\nAPI were assembling Mirage\u2019s loudspeakers so the acquisition made logistical sense when it finally occurred.\nThe Klipsch Group purchased API, but Mirage never really found its legs again and the brand died a rather unceremonious death; unless being sold in empty Magnolia showrooms counts as market presence.\nThe rebirth of Mirage could be a very good thing if the new products live up to the pedigree of the M-1 and smaller models in the series.\nBefore joining the organization in 2006, Bernardo\u00a0served in executive and management positions focused on operations at Audio Products International (maker of the Mirage, Energy and Athena speaker brands), Fineline Circuits Limited and Campeau Corporation. He also holds an HBA and MBA from the University of Western Ontario.\nIn his new endeavor, Oscar is going back to his roots by pursuing his unyielding passion for Canadian audio. He has purchased the iconic Mirage speaker brand with plans to restore its status as the innovator in setting new standards in speaker design and performance.\nThe Mirage legacy began in Canada in 1977 when a small group of devout audiophiles made it their mission to develop a speaker that could deliver a soundstage so natural, audiences would forget they were listening to a product, rather than a live event. The Mirage name is synonymous with immersive, 360\u00ba sound experiences.\nWhile traditional speakers focus on direct sound dispersion, Mirage Omnipolar\u00a0products capture the impact of reflective sound. \u201cOscar is a dedicated, respected, and trusted leader that has made significant contributions to the success of our company,\u201d said Paul Jacobs, president and CEO of Premium Audio Company.\n\u201cHe has\u00a0been integral in carrying out the company\u2019s vision and developing new ways to create, distribute, and sell the most exciting high-performance audio entertainment products around the world. I am confident he will rebuild the Mirage speaker brand to the greatness it deserves,\u201d Jacobs continued.\nWe look forward to seeing what Oscar Bernardo can achieve with Mirage based on his track record over the past 35 years in the high-end loudspeaker category.\nMore Info on Mirage:https://www.stereophile.com/floorloudspeakers/689mirage/\nWebsite:https://www.miragespeakers.com/\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission.\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "content": "Thevintage audiotheme remained very popular with both consumers and manufacturers in 2022; Klipsch, Wharfedale, Mission, and Leak introduced loudspeakers and electronics that offer a blast from the past (minus the shag) but with modern updates and rather expensive price tags. Leak\u2019s original Stereo 30 Integrated Amplifier was a rather coveted piece of equipment that found itself in more than a few London flats.\nLeak was resurrected in 2020 during the height of the pandemic and has continued to expand the lineup based on the growing demand for \u201cvintage\u201d components which has become a hot category for IAG Group; the parent company of Leak, Wharfedale, Mission, Audiolab, and Quad.\nMission recently launched an updated version of its778x Integrated Amplifier, along with theMission 770 loudspeakerswhich sold out in a matter of months.\nThe Leak Stereo 230 offers a slightly different take on the original Stereo 30 and current Stereo 130.\nThe new Leak Stereo 230 Integrated Amplifier offers an increase in power (2 x 75W per channel vs 2 x 45W), upgraded analog and digital circuits, and a revised DAC section that supportshi-res audiostreaming,MQA, and 22.58MHz DSD. The DAC also supports up to 32-bit/768kHz (PCM).\nThe Stereo 230 offers support for Bluetooth 5.0, aptX and AAC codecs.\nJust like the Mission 778x, the Leak Stereo 230 includes a MM phono preamp which is designed to work with anyMM cartridge and high output MC cartsas well.\nLeak have also designed the Stereo 230 to act as a hub for your 2.0 home theater system with a wide range of inputs including HDMI ARC, Toslink Optical, and USB-B. There are also two analog connections for a pair of headphones and 1 pair of RCA inputs for a CD player.\nThe Leak Stereo 230 amps will be available from January 2023 priced at \u00a31249 / $1699 / $2699 with the walnut enclosure (\u00a31099 / $1499 / $2399 without).\nFor more information:leak-hifi.co.uk/stereo230/\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission.\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "content": "Cheesy 1990s graphics? Check. Dated approach to documentary TV? Obviously. Woefully America-centric view of stereophonic sound\u2019s evolution? Certainly! Snobbish, mansplaining white-dude talking heads? Of course.\nAll of this can be true and you can still find much to absorb in the \u2018Stereos\u2019 episode of the series Modern Marvels. Filled with information that lays out the basics of stereophonic sound reproduction and the ways in which inventors and sound geeks changed how we listen to music, the 45-minute documentary, which originally aired on the History Channel, offers a primer on the birth and evolution of recorded sound and the rise of high-fidelity stereo systems \u2013 at least the Westernized version of this history.\nStarting with the birth of the medium, the episode delivers its information in easily digestible chunks, with clunky computer graphics, synth-driven library music, an authoritative, deep voiced narrator and lots of Ken Burns-ian pans of old photos.\nOnce you get over the dated style, though, it\u2019s got a lot of great data and first-hand recollections, most notably from speaker builder Henry Kloss, whose work with Acoustic Research, KLH, and Advent helped transform enthusiasts such as himself into pioneers of sound reproduction.\n\u2018Stereos\u2019 also lays out the basics of vinyl recording in a way that\u2019s simple to understand; you\u2019ll exit the episode understanding why 45-degree angles play a crucial role in record playback and amplification, and the ways in which the CD revolution transformed, for better and worse, the business of recording. You also might notice the unfortunate truth that, despite the absolute dominance of Japanese audio companies in the 1970s, none are acknowledged in the episode until Sony earns a mention as leading the ascent of the CD. (Hey, it\u2019s the History Channel, what do you want?)\nHere\u2019s the episode. Note: Though the clip runs 75 minutes, the doc is about half that in length and repeats twice (probably for some algorithmic reason).\nAnd, just because, below is a YouTube clip of the first ever stereophonic sound recording, which is referenced in the Modern Marvels episode. From the video\u2019s notes:\n\u201cThis is the first single groove stereo recording, produced at Bell\u2019s Telephone Laboratories in New York City on June 1, 1934. AC Keller and IS Rafuse had already conceived a way of separating high and low frequencies and recording them on parallel tracks on the same record. Later they found a way of recording two complete sound tracks and reproducing both tracks simultaneously using a single pickup. From this came two full-range bands from left and right microphones in the same groove. In this recording you will hear Bell Lab employees Ted R. D. Collins, Harley A. Henning, and the inventor Arthur C. Keller. The stereo technique was patented by Keller and Rafuse in 1938.\u201d\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

Those who celebrate Christmas are facing a serious deadline for grabbing the perfect gift for the hi-fi head and those who celebrate Hanukah are already in the thick of it. You are out of time, but you still want to find a present that shows you care.\nBelow, some quick-hit ideas that might assuage your guilt at procrastinating and delight your beloved deep listener with your thoughtfulness. Another idea: order two of each and keep one for yourself as evidence of your deep commitment to your own well-being.\nYes, we are highlighting a few items of our own among these recommendations, but mostly because we\u2019ve only got a few left and want to remind you that they\u2019re running out: Our large, heavy duty canvas tote with extra-long natural web handles fits around 50 records \u2013 and some extra room for a water bottle, canister or sweater.

That\u2019s where the Milty comes in. Pull the trigger and the Zerostat gun will remove the static charge from a record. How? Piezoelectric crystals that give off positive (pull the trigger) and negative (release it) ion streams eliminates the static charge. They cost $99 and are worth every cent.\nLink:https://www.turntablelab.com/products/milty-zerostat-3-anti-static-gun-for-vinyl-cleaning\nStore this turntable right next to your spare tire for those just-in-case moments when you stumble across a record store in the wild. The Numark PT01 is a standard at this point when you want to listen to an LP before you buy it, either to check quality or because the rarity you just found isn\u2019t even on YouTube yet.\nPer Turntable Lab\u2019s sales pitch: \u201cIt\u2019s a good deal all around. The Numark PT01 follows the basic principles of vintage portable models, but adds\u00a0several modern conveniences\u00a0which older portables lack: USB and RCA output, hi/low tone control, and +/- 10% pitch control. In addition, the PT01 has the basics down solid \u2013 33, 45 & 78 rpm play so you can listen to basically any record you find, the inclusion of both 3.5mm and 1/4\u201d headphone inputs so you can listen with whatever headphones you got (or the built-in loudspeaker), plus the ability to run on battery or included power plug\u00a0is crucial.

One of them? Choosing a rad 45 adapter. Love & Victory makes weighted, enameled 45 rpm adaptors that are packaged in a muslin pouch. Great graphic designs include a \u201cDefend Roe v.

        "title": "Ohm Acoustics Loudspeakers: The Budget Audiophiler",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/ohm-acoustics-loudspeakers-the-budget-audiophiler/",
        "content": "There is a wonderful scene inBoschwhen after a long day on the job, Detective Bosch returns home to his glass house on the hill overlooking Los Angeles and puts on a jazz record. Harry (played by Titus Welliver) stares out onto the sprawling city below and sits down to lose himself in the music coming out of his Ohm Acoustics Walsh loudspeakers. I may not have such a striking view of the City of Angels every night, but Harry and I share the same loudspeakers. Ohm loudspeakers that have been manufactured in Brooklyn for almost 50 years.\n\u201cTell me what I spend so much time dealing with you? \u2013 Harry Bosch\nNo loudspeaker is perfect, and the Ohm loudspeakers are not without their faults, but it is their intrinsic ability to emotionally move me with music that makes them impossible to replace.\nThe Ohm Walsh are only one chapter in my journey with the brand, but the one that I am fortunate enough to return to every single day.\nHow did I get here?\nMy love for Ohm loudspeakers began with a simple phone call. I had purchased a used pair of Ohm Fs knowing that they would require some level of repair. The Brooklyn-based loudspeaker manufacturer still supports its legacy loudspeakers; even those manufactured and sold 40 years ago. How many high-end brands do that?\nThe man on the other end of the line was Ohm President, John Strohbeen. I don\u2019t expect to speak with Jeff Bezos or Steve Cook, if I have a problem with an Amazon purchase or Apple product, but having your questions answered by the person in-charge inspires confidence.\nHarry Weisfeld, former CEO of VPI Industries, was renown for spending hours on the phone with customers helping them with their questions, so it\u2019s good to know that this practice is still alive in the world of consumer electronics.\nI told him about my recent purchase and his bold reply was, \u201ccongratulations for purchasing one of the finest speakers ever made.\u201d He detailed the different options for upgrading the loudspeaker, but unfortunately Ohm no longer services the 18\u201d titanium and aluminium Walsh driver. I would have to look elsewhere if I wanted to keep the original driver.\nOhm Acoustics was founded in 1971 by Marty Gersten, former Chief Engineer at Rectilinear, and four other partners using the exclusive patents held by Lincoln Walsh; the inventor of the\u00a0\u201cCoherent Wave Transmission Line Driver.\u201d The Walsh Driver as it is more commonly known. Rectilinear declined to license the Walsh patent and Gersten made a deal with Strohbeen who wanted to sell the new Ohm Acoustics loudspeakers in his stores.\nJohn Strohbeen became president of Ohm Acoustics in 1978; Strohbeen\u2019s career in hi-fi began in his dorm room at MIT where he started Tech HiFi in 1964; one of the first high-end stereo stores where you could purchase Japanese audio equipment.\nThe Ohm A/F was their first creation and is still regarded as one of the best loudspeakers ever made. Perhaps not as famous in some circles as the Quad ESLs, but a very unique and innovative design that has plenty of admirers.\nIn 1981, Ohm Acoustics left the retail market pivoting to direct sales only relying on customer word of mouth and offering a 120-day home trial period. To this day, they still manufacture new loudspeakers and service their legacy loudspeaker lines out of their Brooklyn warehouse.\nFast forward to 2021 and I now own five pairs of Ohm Acoustics loudspeakers, an Ohm shirt, and an Ohm belt buckle. How many audiophiles own a Krell, Wilson, or Vandersteen belt buckle?\nNeedless to say I am a massive fan of Ohm, and the way John Strohbeen runs his company. I had hesitations that my $200 Facebook Marketplace find wouldn\u2019t be worth Ohm\u2019s time to even discuss \u2014 I could not have been more wrong.\nMost high-end audio manufacturers started as small companies and it wasn\u2019t enough to just offer unique products; they had to deliver superior customer service to earn your loyalty. Companies like Ohm Acoustics have never forgotten this.\nMy Ohm F\u2019s were purchased sight unseen with only a somewhat fuzzy picture of the logo. I violated all of my rules in the case of this particular product. Shame on me.\nMuch to my chagrin, their appearance out of the box did not convey the reality of their operational issues. They appeared to be in great shape minus the surrounds that exhibited evidence of dry rot. The seller had all of the original paperwork from 1973 and the original packaging as well. I brought them home and connected them to my system expecting musical ecstasy.\nSilence.\nAnd not the good kind of silence when everyone leaves you alone at home for the day and you can hear your furnace making those odd knocking noises though the floorboards, as you crack open a cold one.\nAfter some audio sleuthing onaudiokarma.org, I found a specialized loudspeaker repair shop outside of Philadelphia, calledMillersound. I send Bill at Millersound an email and he promptly replied with a request for photographs of the Walsh drivers.\nBefore I could send the Ohm Walsh drivers to them, he wanted to ensure that they were in a condition that justified a repair. The drivers could not be creased in any way, and the surrounds had to be the original parts or there was no way to repair them properly.\nAfter close inspection, it was determined that they could be repaired and I packed them carefully in my trunk for the long trek to Philadelphia. Do not even think about shipping these; both from the perspective of cost and the possibility of damage.\nTwo months passed and I received word that the drivers were finally finished. The Walsh driver is quite complex and not something you can fix with some new foam surrounds and call it a day.\n12 hours later (and a lot of miles), we were back home and I reinstalled them in the loudspeaker.\nThese speakers are sublime. They are certainly more elegant than bombastic. Their omnidirectional dispersion pattern fills the room with sound; in a way that forces your brain to readjust to the positioning of spatial cues.\nSetting them up in your room requires some patience and a ruler. I\u2019ve moved them 1/8thof an inch in every direction and noticed a change in the soundstage depth and width; their dispersion pattern interacts with all 4 walls and the smallest changes can have a huge impact on the sound.\nWithin a month I had them dialed in and placed where I liked them the most; 18\u201d from the front wall to the rear of the cabinet. When we\u2019re not using them, I move them back flush against the wall.\nMillersound\u2019s restoration is somewhat of a trade secret, but I do know that only the cone and frame are reused. The rest of the driver is updated. The titanium component of the cone is shaved ever so slightly to ensure that the cone is set perfectly at 90 degrees and a custom made jig is used in the process to ensure the accuracy of the set-up.\nAfter the rebuild, these speakers have proven to be super flexible with amplifiers. I have driven them with as little as 13 watts from the Muzak tube amplifiers and as big as the 300 watts/channel SEA 2500\u2019s. If you do decide to purchase a pair of these, understand that there will be some additional costs to restore them and that you will require a professional to do the work.\nThe Ohm 3XO\u2019s fall into the \u201cWalsh\u201d family of Ohm loudspeakers. The have a omnidirectional low end with a directional tweeter. When set up correctly the \u201cOhm\u201d logo will be on the left speakers and the \u201cWalsh\u201d or \u201c3XO\u201d logo will be on the right speakers. This creates a room sweeping \u201csweet spot\u201d unlike traditional speakers. I had the pair I own updated with new surrounds for the low end and upgraded tweeter from the Ohm factory. Essentially these are now better than new.\nOhm recommends 50-200 watts and my experience is that 60 watts is the minimum amount of power required to really make these speakers come to life. Like the F\u2019s, the placement will alter the sound greatly and these actual came with wheels to make that easier. The 3XO are more domestically friendly with a much smaller footprint measuring 36\u2033 x 13\u2033 x 13\u2033; the larger Walsh F\u2019s are 44\u2033 x 14\u2033 x 14\u2033.\nThe FRS-15 were part of the Ohm lineup in the 1980s. The FRS-15 is a 54\u201d tall square tower with each corner cut about 2\u201d. One of the cut corners near the top, just below the grill, displays the Ohm logo. The FRS-15 is a true Walsh speaker designed for medium to large sized rooms.\nLike the 3XO\u2019s, they have omnidirectional bass response combined with directional tweeters. These speakers can handle up to 250 watts/channel and are rated at 32 \u2013 20,000 Hz (+/-3dB). The 90 dB (6 ohms) sensitivity rating is pretty accurate; I drive them with a pair of 120 watts/channel Luxman power amplifiers and these loudspeakers can play quite loudly. These don\u2019t come up very often on the used market, but they are a deal if you can find a pair in excellent condition. Ohm recommend replacing the foam surrounds every 30 years.\nDon\u2019t be confused by the model designation, because the FRS-7\u2019s are the little sibling to the FRS-15\u2019s in name only. These feature a traditional front facing 6.5\u2033 woofer, 10\u2033 passive radiator on the rear panel, and a 5/8\u201d super-tweeter in the top corner. It makes for a very unique look. Setup is easier as they are not omnidirectional like the loudspeakers above.\nThe sound is dynamic and detailed; Ohm\u2019s recommendation of 25 watts/channel is far too low. I used them for a year with a 45 watts/channel receiver and the sound quality was quite average. When I connected them to my Pilot receiver than can output 80 watts/channel, a different loudspeaker appeared.\nThe super affordableOhm E\u2019swere introduced in the late-1970s and they are one of my favourite Ohm loudspeakers. They sold for $200 at the time and have become quite popular on the used market if they are in good condition. Ohm still offer a number of upgrade options on their website and I find myself using my pair more and more. There is a naturalness to the sound with jazz, classical music, and folk/country/blues that makes them a great pair of loudspeakers for an office, dining room, or bedroom.\nIf you think about it, the ability to have 40 year-old legacy products supported by Ohm Acoustics makes their products rather unique. The Walsh models were quite expensive when they were initially introduced and restoring a pair can be expensive if the drivers are not in great shape.\nI would like to send a special thank you to Jerry, the original owner of my Ohm F\u2019s; for his impeccable taste in audio equipment and to his daughter, Paula, who allowed my family to be the custodian of his Ohm F\u2019s for the next generation.\nFor more information:ohmspeaker.com\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission.\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/part-time-lover/",
        "content": "A few months ago, we took the Pacific Surfliner down the coast to visit one of San Diego\u2019s newest hi-fi bars, Part Time Lover (named after Stevie Wonder\u2019s 1985 hit single). Substantially larger than any listening bar we\u2019d ever been to, the 3,000 sq. ft. space featured a wide array of lounge seating, a full bar stretching across the room, four Klipschorns, two reel-to-reels, a dedicated DJ booth complete with vacuum-powered cleaner, and a record store operating as the satellite location of the legendary Folk Arts Rare Records, one of the oldest record stores in the United States. We arrived late afternoon on a Saturday, just after the bar opened, and the place was already packed with people joyfully conversing over mellow ambient and indie rock.\nA collaborative project, Part Time Lover was made possible by the combined efforts of hospitality group CH Projects, Folk Arts Rare Records, and audio design firm Uncanned Music. Designed like a \u201cdream living room,\u201d the space features a warm and lively east-meets-west aesthetic inspired by the early 20th century American Prairie School architectural style with bar and table lamps custom made by the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation. During the day, record store employees play selections available for sale in the store, and at night, local and visiting DJ\u2019s take over to soundtrack the bar with eclectic sounds ranging from jazz and oldies to disco, reggae, and beyond.\nAfter spending a wonderful night of listening + Japanese hi-balls at Part Time Lover, we reached out to the team behind it to learn more about the project. Below, a short interview with Brendan Boyle of Folk Arts Rare Records, Brian Eastman of CH Projects, and members of Uncanned Music.\nHello Part Time Lover crew! Walking into PTL felt like entering into another world. Can you talk about the inspirations behind opening the space and how Japanese kissa culture is incorporated into the concept?\nWe also love the otherworldly nature of this unique space. Early in the day it\u2019s especially fun to hear Ambient, Modern Composition, Art music, Soundtracks and other experiential sounds. We adore the Japanese kissa concept of \u201cthe listening bar.\u201d We encourage our guest selectors to DJ as they see fit, with the green light to \u201clet it breathe\u201d as well.\nThe design of the bar is gorgeous and seems to mix together a lot of different influences from both Japanese and American architecture. Who designed the bar and can you share a few of the notable elements of the space?\nThe bar was brilliantly designed by Taylor Leage, who heads CH Projects\u2019 Department of Interior Team. Their attention to detail and finished product is wildly impressive. Highlights of the interior space include the acoustics, the ornate columns & the Japanese-inspired lamps.\nPart Time Lover is in many ways powered by the legendary Folk Arts Rare Records store. How did that collaboration come together and how is Folks Arts involved creatively?\nBrendan (Folk Arts): CH Projects\u2019 Arsalun Tafazoli reached out to me in 2020. He clearly had a vision to build something unique for the community of San Diego. Folk Arts has our satellite store in this space, and we curate all of the guest selectors that come in to spin. Between 4pm-10pm or 4pm-8pm seven days a week, we\u2019re creatively spinning \u201csides for sale\u201d at PTL. Our store is dope too. We operate in a DIY style, adding new titles every day of the week.\nWe love that there\u2019s a Folk Arts record shop inside of the bar. Can you recommend five records that are currently available in store?\nBrendan: There are too many great ones but here are five, in no particular order:\nI\u2019m convinced this brilliant LP was a big influence on Sun Ra. One of five albums that Lateef released in 1957. Amazing.\n1970\u2019s avant-garde Japanese Jazz with all of the right bluesy & woozy touches.\nChilled out, barefoot, west coast vibes from one half of Compton & Batteau.\nThese otherworldly piano recordings by this legendary Ethiopian nun have served as a bit of a de facto soundtrack for this space. It never gets old\u2026\nBeing in the record business, you sometimes ask yourself, \u201cHow is this exceptional record still here?\u201d This is the best sounding album in our repertoire. It always elicits an enthusiastic reaction from patrons.\nOf course, I have to ask about the soundsystem. I noticed reel-to-reels are part of the setup? Who designed the system and what are the components (builders, parts, brands)?\nThe soundsystem was brilliantly designed by Uncanned Music. Tons of work was put in by these pros to make sure this system was set up right and it absolutely shows. The sound at PTL is about as good as it gets. People have described the experience to me as a \u2018sound sauna\u2019. The components are:\nUncanned designed a thing of true beauty.\nPeople in San Diego are certainly hungry for a unique, positive experience. I think all of the listening bars in town provide an alternative, more open minded way for people to connect.\nI loved the diverse (and affordable) selection of highballs on the menu. What was the inspiration behind the drink menu?\nBrian Eastman (C.H. Projects): The highballs speak to the simplicity and minimalism of the Japanese listening bar experience. Simple, thoughtful cocktails with quality ingredients meant to be enjoyed over an immersive visit to the space.\nThere seems to be a youthful openness bubbling in San Diego. How has the response been to Part Time Lover and other new bars opening up recently like Goto Convoy music bar and Longplay HiFi?\nPeople in San Diego are certainly hungry for a unique, positive experience. I think all of the listening bars in town provide an alternative, more open minded way for people to connect. These spots aren\u2019t conventional \u201cparty\u201d places but rather nightlife destinations that embrace a slow, spontaneous & joyful energy.\nWhat\u2019s coming up next for the bar? I\u2019ve noticed the booking keeps getting better with incredible locals plus guests from around the world.\nWe hope for the programming at PTL to continue to get more eclectic & diverse into the future. It\u2019s already been quite the ride. Our motivation is fueled by all of the positive experiences PTL has created for San Diego, and there\u2019s most certainly quite a lot of excitement on the horizon.\nRead our article on Listening Bars Around the World:https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/isc-guide-listening-bars/\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "title": "Guide to Subwoofers: Setup Tips, Crossovers, and more",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/guide-to-subwoofers/",
        "content": "In order to experience great sound in a speaker setup, you need speaker drivers that provide clarity, depth, and the ability to provide a full range of audio frequencies.Tweetersare designed to handle high frequencies, theMidrangedriver handles the frequencies associated with vocals, while aWooferhandles the low frequencies. This is referred to as athree-way speaker.\nMany times, especially for compact speakers, the midrange and woofer are combined into a single speaker (aka a2-way speaker).More on 2-way vs 3-way speakers.\nFor movies and bass-heavy music, a woofer may not be able to reproduce all of the low frequencies. To provide more sonic impact (hearing and feeling), you need a subwoofer which is a specific type of speaker that handles only the lowest frequencies that other speakers can\u2019t reproduce.\nIn what is considered a basic surround sound system (5.1 channels), there are five main speakers: Left, Center, Right, Left Surround, and Right Surround. In addition, a\u00a0 subwoofer is assigned to reproduce low frequencies (usually below 120Hz). The subwoofer is associated with the .1 channel.\nTip: The role of the subwoofer is the same regardless of how many channels and speakers are in the rest of your system.\nPassive\nA passive subwoofer needs to be powered by an external amplifier. The external amplifier may be part of an amplifier that powers the rest of the speakers or more typically, an externalsubwoofer amplifierthat is placed between a preamp or home theater receiver (via a subwoofer output) and the speaker terminals of a passive subwoofer.\nPowered\nPowered subwoofers incorporate both the subwoofer speaker driver and an amplifier inside the same enclosure. For the powered subwoofer to work, in addition to AC power, a line output (sub out orLFEout) from a home theater receiver needs to connect to the subwoofer.\nA powered subwoofer takes excessive power load away from the amp/receiver so that the amp/receiver can power the other speakers in a system more efficiently, Most subwoofers used in home theater setups are powered.\nIn addition to how power and audio signals get to a subwoofer, there are other features that the subwoofer has that contribute to its bass role.\nSealed Cabinet: Some subwoofer speaker drivers are enclosed in a sealed enclosure. This means that all of the air is pushed out directly from the speaker driver into the room.\nPassive Radiator: Some subwoofer enclosures incorporate a passive radiator in addition to the speaker. This increases efficiency and preciseness. Passive radiators can either be speakers with the voice coil removed or a flat diaphragm.\nPort:Some subwoofer enclosures offer an additional port. This forces out more air, as it is coming from both the speaker and the port. Some ports may be cylindrical while others might be slotted. This increases bass response in a more efficient manner than sealed enclosures, but may not be as precise. A ported design is referred to asbass reflex.\nA crossover is a circuit that sends frequencies below a specific point to the subwoofer and frequencies above that specific point to the other speakers in the system. 80Hz to 100Hz are commonly used points, but most subwoofers provide additional adjustable crossover points. In addition, most home theater receivers includebass management, which allows further control of what frequencies are sent to the subwoofer.\nDeep-bass frequencies (below 80Hz) are non-directional. This means that human ears have difficulty pinpointing the source location of bass frequencies. This means a subwoofer can be placed in a room where its bass response is best in relation to the size of a room, type of floor (carpet, wood, other), furniture placement, and wall surfaces.\nDepending on the subwoofer, the following connection options may be provided.\nTip: Most powered subwoofers with wired-only connectivity can also be made wireless via an adapter kit that includes a transmitter that plugs into a subwoofer output of a home theater receiver and a receiver that plugs into the subwoofer inputs.\nThe most common spot to place a subwoofer is in front of a room, to the left or right main speakers. However, they can also be placed along a wall or in the back of the room. The key is to place it where it sounds best. You want to minimize the \u201cboomy\u201d base as much as possible. The bass should be deep and tight.\nUse crossover settings to get the best balance between what the subwoofer reproduces in relation to the speakers in the rest of the system. Most subwoofers provide crossover settings. In addition, most home theater or AV receivers providecrossover(akabass management) settings that can further tweak what frequencies are sent to both the main speakers and subwoofer. Read your home theater receiver\u2019s user guide for specific details, but here are some possible options:\nIf you set the main speakers to \u201clarge\u201d and have a subwoofer, low frequencies (LFE and non-LFE) will be sent to both the main speakers and subwoofer.\nTip: Depending on the receiver, when set to large the low frequencies may be sent to the front left/right speakers and subwoofer but not to the center or surround speakers.\nIf you set the main speakers to \u201csmall\u201d all low frequencies, whether they contain a dedicated LFE signal or not will be sent to the subwoofer.\nIf your receiver has an LFE+Main setting option all low frequencies will be sent to the Subwoofer (LFE and non-LFE) whether the speaker channels are set to \u201clarge\u201d or \u201csmall\u201d.\nFor details on LFE, read our companion article:WTF is LFE?\nIn addition to home theater and surround sound, subwoofers can also be used in a stereo system for music listening. When a subwoofer is added to a stereo setup, it is referred to as a 2.1-channel setup.\nThis can be done in two ways:\n1. Some stereo receivers have subwoofer outputs. This means you can connect a powered subwoofer to your system using a single audio cable.\n2. If you have a powered subwoofer that has standard speaker input/output terminals in addition to a subwoofer input, you can connect the left and right channel speaker outputs of your stereo receiver to the subwoofer and route the speaker output connections to your left and right channel speakers.\nThis creates a little more wire clutter, but the benefit is that you get an extra bass boost from the subwoofer, which comes in handy if you are using compact-size left and right-channel speakers.\nIn this type of setup, you would use the crossover controls on the subwoofer to determine the point where audio frequencies are reproduced by the subwoofer and which frequencies are sent further to the left and right channel speakers.\nMost soundbars come packaged with a subwoofer, which typically connects to the soundbar wirelessly via bluetooth or Wi-Fi. In this type of setup, the soundbar has a pre-determined crossover point that determines which frequencies are reproduced by the soundbar and which are assigned to the subwoofer.\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission.\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "content": "We\u2019re a little late on this, but figured it makes sense to share anyway in case anyone missed the news\u2026 Earlier this week, Audio-Technica dropped a limited-edition model of their fan favoriteSound Burger portable turntablewith modern updates including Bluetooth connectivity and USB-C charging for 12 hours of continuous playback. Originally launched in 1980, the Sound Burger was meant to be a competitor of the Sony Walkman, but has since reached cult status due to the rise in popularity of vinyl and its \u201cnear mythic\u201d sound quality.\nUnsurprisingly, the run of 7,000 sold out almost immediately and the turntables are already popping up onreseller sitesfor more than three times the original $199 MSRP. It\u2019s crazy to think that drop culture has even made its way to audio equipment and turntables, but here we are!\nThe hype does seem warranted though as the reviews have been overwhelmingly positive so far with fans praising the brand \u201cfor not pushing out a cheap mechanism dressed up with their branding and actually caring how it sounds.\u201d We also love that the promo materials are clearly intended for a younger generation of vinyl consumers. The \u201cvintage retro\u201d aesthetic is quite popular with Gen Z so the strategy seems completely on point.\nOf course, we still have to give props to the original Sound Burger promo designs that are just incredibly creative, fun, and unlike any other turntable advertisements we\u2019ve seen. Sound Island, Sound Coffee-Cup, Sound Crocodile\u2026 Just amazing!\nFrom Audio-Technica:\n\u201cThe limited-edition AT-SB2022 portable turntable is the return of the Sound Burger, a fan favorite since the 1980s thanks to its nostalgic design, quirky advertising campaigns, and unique listening experience, with\u00a0modern updates including Bluetooth\u00ae connectivity and a USB-C charging cable. Connect to your Bluetooth headphones or speakers and enjoy your favorite vinyl records wirelessly for up to 12 hours. This turntable features a lightweight design making it perfect for parties, picnics, or compact living spaces.\u201d\nWe hope the incredible response pushes Audio-Technica to do a mass non-limited release of the Sound Burger\u2026 We\u2019d love to have a quality new turntable for record fairs, storage unit digs, or even just casually playing a few records at the park with friends.

        "title": "Wharfedale Linton Heritage Speakers: The Audiophile System Builder",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/wharfedale-linton-heritage/",
        "content": "Wharfedale\u2019s founder, Gilbert Briggs built his first loudspeaker in 1932 in his home in Ilkey, Yorkshire; the town was based in the valley of the river \u201cWharfe.\u201d Briggs opened Wharfedale Wireless Works in 1933 supplying advanced loudspeaker drivers to the growing radio industry and the company became a leading supplier selling more than 9,000 units per year until the outbreak of World War II. The company flourished after the war and became one of the first companies to offer a two-way loudspeaker in 1945 \u2013 the prototype for the modern loudspeaker. Briggs would be quite impressed with the Wharfedale Linton Heritage speakers more than 7 decades later.\nWharfedale introduced the original Linton in 1965 and the model which utilized three drive units developed a strong following with its smooth midrange, punchy low end, and sense of scale. The model disappeared from their line-up in the 1970s but was recently reintroduced as the stand-mounted Linton Heritage. Wharfedale has also designed a custom stand for the Linton Heritage that puts the tweeter around 36\u201d from the floor and includes room for records as well.\nThe three-way loudspeakers are larger than mostbookshelf loudspeakersmaking the stands a logical accessory to maximize their performance. The modern Linton feature an 8-inch Kevlar cone woofer, 5-inch Kevlar cone midrange driver, and 1-inch soft dome tweeter. Listeners may decide to ditch the woven grille covers, but we think they give the Linton that old-school look that makes them stand out.\nWharfedale designed the Linton with two rear ports which requires giving these loudspeakers some distance from the wall behind them; the 8-inch woofer can deliver the goods with only 20 watts so don\u2019t confuse old with polite. The Linton Heritage offer all of the midrange resolution and natural sound of the original, but with a lot more detail, speed, and transparency.\nThey deliver scale and image rather well considering their boxy looking cabinet. If your budget can stretch to $1,800 which includes the stands, the Linton should be on your short list.\nWhat we like the most about the Wharfedale Linton Heritage speakers is that you don\u2019t need to spend a fortune on electronics to really enjoy them and they look great; some people are unhappy that they are manufactured in China but there is no way Wharfedale could manufacture these in the United Kingdom with this level of quality at that price. No way.\nI know that everyone can\u2019t pull these 2 to 3 feet out into the room, but it makes a big difference if you can. It also helps if you can angle them towards your listening position as opposed to pointing them directly ahead.\nHaving lived with a pair of Spendor SP2/3s for almost 8 years, I am painfully aware that speakers like the Linton Heritage (which remind me so much of the Spendor Classic lineup) can produce a \u201cwall of sound\u201d and not image very well if you don\u2019t angle them at your listening position.\nThe positioning can have a huge impact on the bass response and while you might lose some of the midrange warmth with the drivers pointed directly at your head, the precision of the imaging will improve and you are likely to hear more detail in your recordings.\nThe stands should also be considered a mandatory accessory.\nThe Linton Heritage can work well with a lot of different amplifiers; Audiolab, Rotel, Cambridge Audio, Naim, Croft Acoustics, Creek, and vintage amplifiers from Marantz, Audio Research, and Sansui are all solid options.\nIf you follow Wharfedale on Instagram, you\u2019ll notice that Linton Heritage owners use a wide range of electronics with them. I\u2019ve seen everything from McIntosh integrated amplifiers, Naim Supernait 3 amplifiers,Aragon4004 MKIIpower amplifiers, and a lot ofAudiolab 6000A integrated amplifiersas well.\nI\u2019m not sure that I would use really warm sounding amplifiers with the Linton Heritage only because it will be too much of a good thing and my listening experience with them suggests that they could become rather boring over the long haul.\nI do think they sound better with 45 watts or more and they will not self-destruct with 200 watts/channel either.\nDepending on your budget, theRotel A14MKII Integrated Amplifier,Croft Phono Integrated, andNaim NAIT 5siwill all work really well with the Linton Heritage speakers.\nThe Rotel A14MkII is an updated version of Rotel\u2019s best-selling A14 integrated amplifier that has a lot of power under the hood. The chassis doesn\u2019t give way just how much grunt there is under the ventilated top cover but it\u2019s there.\u00a0It delivers 80 watts/channel with a decent MM phono stage.\nThe Croft Phono Integrated only delivers 45 watts/channel but it sounds far more powerful and has a phenomenal MM phono stage in a no-frills chassis that looks dated as hell. Croft has never spent any money on a fancy box but it sounds sublime with Wharfedale loudspeakers. I\u2019ve used Croft & Wharfedale together for many years and it\u2019s definitely going to be one of my systems when I retire.\nThe Naim NAIT 5si does not include a phono stage but it has so much pace and energy, that it\u2019s hard to not love it with the Wharfedale speakers. I\u2019ve heard expensive Naim separates with the Wharfedale Linton Heritage speakers and just loved the combination.\nTheRega Planar 3($1,125) with theNagaoka MP-110 cartridge($154) will really shine with the Rotel or Croft amplifiers.\nWharfedale Linton Heritage Loudspeakers($1,799/pairwith the matching stands)\nFinishes:\u00a0Walnut or Red Mahogany\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission.\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/decware-superzen-triode/",
        "content": "Over the past 23 years, I have had the opportunity to listen to more products than I can possibly remember; the truly superb ones that left such an impression that I contemplated selling an organ or getting a third job \u2014 I would say that number is under 20. TheDecware SuperZen Triodemakes that list without too much effort.\nNone of them were weird looking or so outlandish that I lay in bed at night sweating next to my spouse knowing that she would divorce me (again) if I made the decision to acquire one. Nothing looks sexier than a restored pair ofQuad ESLs orMartinLogan CLZ IIzin a post-modern living room. Having owned a Wavelength Audio Duetto, Fi X, and Emotive Audio Sira, it is fair to say that I am someone who enjoys a good light show.\nI have just never had a lot of luck with tube gear that has proven very reliable; the truth is that the tubes were almost always the culprit and that includes some Western Electric 300Bs that detonated for no apparent reason and I balked at spending over $800 (more than 20 years ago) to replace them. Cheap Russian 300B replacements lasted two years before I sold the amplifier.\nTheUnison Research Triode 25 Integrated Amplifiercurrently under review sounds absolutely stellar and I\u2019m rather smitten. One of the tubes already put on a strange glow and the crackle through my Q Acoustics 3050i proved to be nothing.\nMaybe.\nReliability is huge and that\u2019s what you get when you buy fromDecware.\nWhen you order a SuperZen Triode amplifier you get durability, tubes that don\u2019t get driven so hard that they die within months, and superb sound quality.\nTheDecware SuperZen Triodeis a handmade 2.3 watts/channel tube amplifier that hits much harder than its power rating would suggest in a smaller room or home office. There are two pairs of RCA inputs, and it is available with several different bases for additional cost.\nIt\u2019s built incredibly well by a company that has such a cult following that the waiting list is getting longer and longer with each passing day.\nJust how long? Possibly 8 months before your order gets built. Or even longer after taking a recent look at the waiting list.\nThe amplifier has a rather non-conventional look (12\u201dD x 6\u201dW x 8\u201dH) and absolutely becomes the focal point of any system; both aesthetically and sonically.\nIt\u2019s rare to find their products on the \u201cused\u201d market and they don\u2019t last more than a day when one pops up. $1,395 for this 18-pound amplifier that has a lifetime warranty and delivers rather remarkable performance at this price.\nMade in America to very high standards and I\u2019ve never heard a single Decware amplifier that didn\u2019t sound great with high sensitivity loudspeakers.\nThey also stand by their products, offer excellent customer service, and their amplifiers don\u2019t use super expensive exotic tubes that cost a fortune to replace.\nThe Decware SuperZen Triode Model SE84UFO2\u00a0is shipped with\u00a0premium quality\u00a0NOS 6P15P-EV output tubes with gold grids rated at over 5000 hours. These Russian military spec tubes are the top grade of what we came to know in this country for a brief spell as the SV83. You can also use EL84 tubes in this amp.\nWhat makes the Decware SuperZen Triode such a good amplifier is that it gets the basics right; quality circuit design, good iron, affordable tubes, and excellent reliability.\nFor a tube amplifier, it doesn\u2019t commit the usual sins of rolling off the top end or sounding slightly soft in the bottom. Pair it with the right pair of loudspeakers and it can create a huge soundstage and layers of beautiful music in your space.\nOmega Speaker Systemshave a very loyal following because they offer bespoke high-sensitivity loudspeakers that offer tremendous performance and craftsmanship. Louis Chochos is a detail-oriented designer and builder who offers excellent customer service and is willing to work with each customer to make sure they get the \u201cright\u201d loudspeaker for their specific situation. He builds beautiful looking cabinets that are designed to last.\nTheCAM(Compact Alnico Monitor) don\u2019t have the slam of the now discontinued Zu Audio Cubes, but they are overflowing with texture and definitely more laid back sounding which might be preferable in a nearfield listening situation. They are \u201ccompact\u201d in comparison to other Omega models, but they are certainly not small loudspeakers (16\u201dH x 12\u201dW x 8.5\u201dD) that will vanish on your desktop.\nThey can be ordered with the bass port on the rear/front of the cabinet depending on your set-up location. They work really well in a bookcase with the port on the front of the cabinet. The 94.5 dB (8 ohms) sensitivity rating makes them ideal for the Decware amplifier.\nNot everyone wants to spend another $1,495 on a pair of loudspeakers after buying the SuperZen Triode, and most of the single-driver loudspeakers tend to be on the larger side which makes the desktop system scenario almost impossible.\n2.5 watts is not a lot of power and that does limit your options \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean that there are none.\nWharfedale has replaced my beloved Diamond 10.1s which I still use in my office with the new Diamond 12 models and we are huge fans of the Diamond 12.1 bookshelf loudspeakers and have covered them extensively; you can read our system building suggestionshereand read my detailedreviewas well.\nThe Diamond 10.1s certainly worked with the SuperZen Triode on the desktop as long as you\u2019re not looking for anything more than conversation level volume and I suspect that the newer 12.1s will work as well.\nYou could also add a REL T Zero MKIII Subwoofer to this system which would allow you to drive the loudspeakers above 100Hz with the Decware and we suspect that might work ever better and it would still be $500 less than the Omega CAMs.\nThere are a wide range of DACs and streamers that work well including theAudioQuest DragonFly Cobalt(which you can use separately as your headphone amplifier),Andover Audio Songbird/Schiit Audio Modi 3 Multibit DACcombination, orCambridge Audio CXN V2 streamer/DAC.\nAnother excellent network streamer that keeps the cost down is the brand newBluesound NODEwhich keeps things really simple as it already has an internal DAC. $599 and access to all of the major streaming platforms.\nThe Decware almost screams out for a good vintage turntable and we\u2019re huge fans of therestored Thorens turntables by Vinyl Nirvanawhich is based in New Hampshire.\nSelect either theCroft AcousticsorMoon by SimAudiophono stage fromour list of favorite audiophile phono preampsand you have a very high-end system for under $7,000.\nIf you require a CD player because you don\u2019t do the streaming thing or gave up on vinyl playback, theMarantz CD60is a really good option for the SuperZen Triode.\nFor more information:Decware SuperZen Triode Amplifier\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission.\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "title": "Vinyl Nirvana & The Art of Vintage Turntable Restoration",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/vinyl-nirvana/",
        "content": "Have you taken a look at turntable prices lately? Inflation is having a significant impact on the prices of high-end audio components and it is not not unusual to see 20 to 30% increases with some brands. Very few brands can absorb the rising costs due to supply chain issues and not have to charge more. Mass produced tables from brands like Fluance, Pro-Ject, Audio-Technica, and Rega are still not out of reach for audiophiles but does it now make sense to start looking at vintage turntable restorations that offer better long-term value?Vinyl Nirvananeeds to be on your radar if that is the case.\nDave Archambault is a busy man. The proprietor of New Hampshire-based Vinyl Nirvana has been restoring and rebuilding vintage Thorens and Acoustic Research turntables full-time for almost a decade and 2020/2021 proved to be very challenging years; a period that he was able to navigate through a lot of hard work, creativity, and a major pivot when events beyond his control both at home here in America and in Asia almost upset the golden applecart.\nHe has becomethesource for affordable restorations and reproductions that are second to none, but Vinyl Nirvana is not a large turntable manufacturer like Pro-Ject, Rega, or VPI who have the ability to engineer and manufacture their own tonearms.\n2021 was a record year for vinyl sales across the globe with tens of millions of people stuck at home because of pandemic lockdown rules. Americans spent over $1 billion on40 million new records in the United States alone. That\u2019s the most new albums shipped in the U.S. in 33 years (since 1988).\nTheRIAA H1 2022 music industry reportjust released made a lot of people in the vinyl and turntable categories rather happy; vinyl sales rose 22% in the United States during the first 6 months of the year and while that\u2019s a far cry from the 97% increase during the same period in 2021 \u2014 there were a number of mitigating factors that created such a dramatic increase.\nPandemic, shuttered record stores, brisk online sales, travel restrictions, and no live music.\nInflation is certainly not helping any industry right now (unless you\u2019re buying a new or used car), and consumers were unlikely to increase spending on non-essential items such as records when the average family is spending $400 to $500 more each month on gasoline, food, and clothing.\nA 22% increase still suggests that there is strong interest in new vinyl sales.\nThat massive surge in demand also put a lot of pressure onturntable and tonearm manufacturers; which was exacerbated by supply chain issues across the globe.\nJapanese tonearm manufacturer, Jelco, a major supplier of OEM tonearms for a number of manufacturers, restoration companies, and the DIY community called it quits creating a massive shortage of tonearms.\nAdding to the shortage was the inane decision by British manufacturer, SME, to stop selling its renown high-end tonearms to anyone. If you want one of their tonearms, you have to buy one of their very expensive turntables. Greed isn\u2019t always good.\nSo what does a bespoke restoration company do when two of its primary tonearm suppliers decide to make life difficult for everyone?\nIt pivots to something even better manufactured in Japan that will be available on all of the Vinyl Nirvana models based around the Thorens TD-160 Super and TD-125 turntables.\nI\u2019ve seen it. I\u2019m not allowed to share. It will be installed on my new Thorens TD-125 MK II restoration which I hope to have in Q4. I just need to get in line like everybody else.\nI\u2019ve been a customer of Vinyl Nirvana for over 5 years; 2 restored Thorens turntables are my reference decks at home, and I endorse Vinyl Nirvana as someone who paid full price for his turntables and has benefitted enormously from their set-up and performance advice.\nCustomer service is a huge reason why people patronize smaller companies, and this is one company that gets that part right. Much better than other brands in the audiophile space.\nSo if 2020 was a much harder year for companies like Vinyl Nirvana to get enough tonearms to keep up with the demand for finished tables, how did they deal with the shortfall?\nRestorations and parts sales.\nEven with his tonearm issue resolved, Archambault did the smartest thing possible. He focused on consulting services and restorations of older Thorens and Acoustic Research turntables that people were buying in huge numbers on eBay or discovering in the basement or attic.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been busy. Very busy,\u201d remarked Archambault when we spoke on the phone last week.\n\u201cOver the past 20 years since I started the company, I\u2019ve accumulated the largest stash of new/used Thorens parts in the world, which makes what we do invaluable. A big part of my business is helping the customer who discovers a 35-year-old TD-125 in their parent\u2019s attic which needs to be serviced but they don\u2019t know where to turn. Not only do I have the parts, but I can make it sound better than it ever did,\u201d said Archambault.\n\u201cTheThorens TD-125, in particular, is my favorite turntable to work on. I cringe a little when I see other restoration companies build brand new plinths that completely swallow up the front of the table. That design feature is so iconic, and I make sure that our custom wood plinths only accentuate the beauty of it,\u201d explained Archambault.\n\u201cWhat made the TD-125 so unique was the electronic speed control that was a major feature of the turntable. The pitch control was a very important feature that high-end buyers demanded and Thorens made it work.\u201d\n\u201cThorens sold more than 100,000 TD-125s in 1975 alone if the numbers are accurate, and that means that there are a lot of tables and parts floating around. I was smart when I started and bought up as much of the supply of parts that I could find,\u201d Archambault explained.\nThe TD-125 was originally sold with its own tonearm, but users began switching them out for SME tonearms for their superior performance. With SME out of the DIY game, Archambault is confident that his new tonearm will be popular with his customers; which include some heavy-hitters from the music world, actors, comedians, and regular music lovers looking for a durable and custom turntable.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, the TD-125 is a very easy turntable to service. I\u2019ve worked on so many of them at this point, that I feel like it\u2019s a part of me. Thorens knew what they were doing when they built this deck. It\u2019s a heavy suspended design with a 7-pound platter and they are made to last.\u201d\nSo why buy a used Thorens and have It restored to its original glory? Why not buy something new?\nSwiss-made (or German-made depending on the decade) Thorens turntables have been prized by audiophiles for both their sound quality and precision engineering since 1957 with the launch of the TD-124 idler drive turntable, and that list has grown over the years to include the TD-145, TD-150, TD-160/Super, and TD-125 belt-driven models.\nThorens relocated their manufacturing to Germany, Poland, and Switzerland during some rather tumultuous decades for the company as it struggled to combat the birth of digital audio, and only recently in 2018 was restructured with new ownership that is based in Germany. Thorens is back in the game of manufacturing brand new high-end turntables but has shown little interest in supporting legacy products that were some of the best belt-driven turntables ever made.\nThe brand is back in force with a new lineup of turntables, including a replacement for the TD-160, but the real demand for its turntables remains focused on the designs of the past.\n\u201cAll of the Thorens tables have this remarkable quality about them. Precision instruments with enormous modification potential and a very smooth sound that will never go out of style. I can\u2019t imagine why anyone would want something made overseas that doesn\u2019t have the build quality to last a generation. These tables have survived decades of use and still sound better than a lot of new tables sold today. I\u2019m proud to offer them,\u201d explained Archambault.\nVinyl Nirvana offers complete packages which include exotic hardwood plinths, a choice of tonearms, and cartridge options from Grado Labs, Ortofon, and Dynavector. Information about their restoration services and consultation process is available on their website.\nFor more information:vinylnirvana.com\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission.\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "title": "Quad 303 Power Amplifier and 33 Pre/Tuner: The Budget Audiophiler",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/quad-303-33/",
        "content": "As much as I want to say that all of the great vintage audio came out of New York in the 1960s, that\u2019s certainly not the case. We\u2019re going to take a trip across the pond this week to discuss one of the most important British audio brands that is still going strong as part of theInternational Audio Group(Wharfedale, Audiolab, Mission, Castle Acoustics) and whose vintage audio products are heavily sought after by audiophiles.\nThe Quad ESLs established the brand as a major player in the world of high-end audio in 1957, but we\u2019re not going to focus on Peter Walker\u2019s revolutionary electrostatic loudspeakers right now \u2013 our focus is going to be on the Quad 303 power amplifier and 303 Control Unit.\nStarted after WWII and under the direction of Peter Walker, Quad introduced their first amplifier, theQuad 1, and subsequently in 1953, theQuad 2.\nBoth were tube amplifiers and are quite collectible now if you can find a set. Everything changed for the company in 1957 with the introduction of the Quad ESL loudspeakers. The ESL, contrary to any other stories, was not their first loudspeaker. It was their first commercial success in the category.\nThe original ESL, in production between 1957 and 1985, has been hailed in almost every audio publication in the world as one of the most important speakers of the 20th century. It was succeeded in 1981 by the ESL-63, which remained in production until 1999.\nFor all of its remarkable transparency, the Quad ESL was a very difficult loudspeaker to drive. If you\u2019ve never heard a pair in great working condition, it\u2019s an experience worth having. Especially when you realize that the technology is from almost 60 years ago. The listening sweet spot is also remarkably small; basically, one person.\nVintage audio fans will spend a lot of money for a restored pair; and as I\u2019ve discovered recently the same group of people have a lot of respect for the Quad 303 and 33.\nQuad introduced their first transistor amplifier unit in 1967 and that is where the Quad 303 and 33 enter the picture. Quad did not have a wide catalog of products unlike many of their competitors, and purposely built their products to have a long life cycle.\nThe first thing you notice about all of the Quad solid-state equipment is that it looked nothing like any of the other equipment of the period; and nothing like anything that has come since. None of the U.S. or Japanese manufacturers created anything that looked or sounded like the Quad products of the period.\nThe tuner, preamp, and amplifier were all separate units; you could hide the amplifier away from view leaving just the 10 \u00bc\u201d wide and 6\u201d deep preamplifier and tuner visible.\nThe Quad 303 used rather interesting heatsinks to dissipate heat and while it benefits from ventilation, Quad knew that users would place it inside a console or cabinet.\nCompared to the 20-24\u201d wide models being created in Japan and the United States, the Quad 33 mini stack could fit just about anywhere. The Quad cases are grey metal with plastic orange and white buttons in contrast to the normal metal faceplates of the time that were common with Fisher, Marantz, and McIntosh.\nAudio reviewers were unduly harsh in their criticism of the color scheme, but consumers had a very different opinion about it. I find Quad\u2019s choice of grey metal combined with the orange tuner dial, and white buttons to be strikingly more interesting than anything else being offered at the time from most of the manufacturers. McIntosh and Marantz had a very distinct look that is still prized today and the consensus online among collectors is that Quad hit one out of the park.\nThe Quad 33 Control Unit features a Radio 1, Radio 2 (AUX), Disc (phono everywhere else on the planet), and 2 Tape inputs (one for record/play and one for playback only). The first thing anyone will notice is the use of DIN inputs. Naim Audio have used DIN plugs for decades and there are anumber of companiesmaking 3rdparty RCA to DIN cables/plugs that you can use to connect the 303 to the 33 and sources.\nNot the end of the world as they can still be found but if you have a chance to buy one of these units ensure cabling is part of the deal; especially the Quad power cords as they are unlike anything I have seen in other units. Speakers are easily connected with banana plugs.\nThe Control Unit and Tuner weigh 6.5 pounds while the amplifier comes in at 18 pounds.\nAside from the volume dial, you can adjust the sound with bass, treble and slope dials as well as 5k, 7k, and 10k button filters. These are for removing record surface noise and high frequency distortion when used in concert with the slope dial. Quad provides diagrams for this in their instruction booklet, but I found it just as easy, and enjoyable to try the variety of options to dial in the sound I like.\nThe Cancel button allows you to hear the music without alteration and having to adjust any of your preferences. A modern version of a bypass switch.\nThe Quad 303 is rated at a very respectable 45 watts per channel into 8 ohms making this very easy to pair with speakers of the time. When I cracked open the case, I appreciated the forward thinking layout which was designed for easy servicing; something that is not the case with a lot of the receivers from the 1970s.\nQuad wanted these components to last and if parts had to be replaced, the goal was to make it easy for a qualified technician or owner to do so.\nI\u2019ve seen restorers of these products change the DIN connections to RCA input jacks and that\u2019s certainly an option if you have technical ability to do it.\nThe Quad 303 and 33 definitely have a sound; and I\u2019ve noticed from other users online that a lot of people like them with the BBC LS3/5a models (15 ohm version produced by Rogers is a very good choice), Quad ESLs, Tannoy, Wharfedale Diamond Series, and older KEF and Spendor loudspeakers.\nI would not blast music through the Quad 303. It was designed to work with high impedance loudspeakers (8 ohm or higher) at conversation levels.\nIn terms of my own vintage loudspeakers, I found the experience rather interesting.\nI used the Quad 303 and 33 in my main system with the Ohm F\u2019s on a Niles A/B switcher with the other system being a McIntosh C28 with an SAE 2500 amplifier.\nWith some adjustments of the filters, tone, slope, and volume, \u2014 it was actually hard to tell the two systems apart. It was really that good. The Quad combination is definitely \u201cwell mannered\u201d and certainly not a forward sounding combination with propulsive bass response. You need to adjust the tone and filters to create a more \u201cmodern\u201d sound.\nOne area where the Quad 303 and 33 truly shine is when you adjust the sound to conversation levels with better recordings. The warm tonal balance is almost impossible to ignore but the detail retrieval was surprisingly quite good.\nSome might find the overall presentation slightly too relaxed, but I think it really depends on your choice of loudspeaker and I was quite amazed at how much I enjoyed music through this combination. It\u2019s definitely a pairing I want to own at some point.\nNot everyone has a pair ofOhm F\u2019savailable, so I also used the Quad 303 and 33 with my Dynaco a25\u2019s,Advent Large, and my new EPI M100\u2019s. The 303 drove them all quite effortlessly, highlighting the bass response of the Advents, and the overall balance of the Dynaco loudspeakers.\nThe Quad 303 and 33 threw me for a loop. I didn\u2019t know what to expect and they were a wonderful combination that made a lot of modern music (especially poorly recorded albums) sound a lot better. They are popular with collectors so prepare to pay a decent amount for a set in very good condition.\nThere are people who specialize in their restoration but that comes with a serious price tag. Quad hit one out of the park with the 303/33 combination and I think music lovers in the U.K. were very lucky to get their hands on them first.\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission."

        "title": "Eavesdrop: An audiophile living room meets izakaya in Greenpoint",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/eavesdrop-nyc/",
        "content": "Anyone who has spent time in New York knows that it\u2019s aloudcity. The streets are constantly bustling with activity. Bars and restaurants are filled with lively conversation, sometimes at almost shouted levels. Countless clubs across the city deliver various strains of dance floor-oriented music to eager crowds on massive sound systems each and every night. With audiophile and jazz kissa culture spreading around the world, it\u2019s perhaps no surprise, then, that a new type of space has recently emerged in the city designed specifically for noise-conscious listening\u2026\nEavesdrop, a listening / wine bar meets\u00a0izakaya in New York City\u2019s Greenpoint neighborhood, quietly opened earlier this year and has since been making a buzz around town as a must-visit destination for music and hi-fi lovers. Co-founded by Charlie Ballinger, Max Dowaliby, Dan Wissinger, and designer Danny Taylor, owner of New York audio consultancy House Under Magic, the quaint 1000 sq. ft. space features 36 carefully placed seats, a finely tuned sound system with a diffusion wall and acoustic panels, and a menu of craft cocktails, natural wines, and small plates.\nA few friends of In Sheep\u2019s Clothing are regular selectors at Eavesdrop and introduced us to co-founder Dan Wissinger. Below, we asked Dan a few questions over email to learn more about the concept and intention behind this unique space.\nWhat was your inspiration for opening Eavesdrop? Obviously it\u2019s quite different from other music venues in New York and also different even from Public Records, the other hi-fi minded spot in the city.\nOf course, we were inspired by what we\u2019ve heard of jazz kissa / listening bar culture in Tokyo and around the world, but I\u2019d say what we really tried to recreate with Eavesdrop was the feeling of friends hanging out at home playing records for each other.\nNew York has so many great places for music, but most of them are dance-floor-oriented.\u00a0We love clubs, but we always felt like our favorite part of the night was the pre-party: having friends over for dinner and drinks, usually to whoever\u2019s apartment has the best sound system. Bring your records, bring your USB, everyone take turns on the decks. Those were really the nights that inspired us to create Eavesdrop.\nThe small, intimate space reminds us of a lot of jazz kissas in Japan. Did any specific spots in Japan inspire the design of Eavesdrop?\nThe honest truth is\u2026 we haven\u2019t been.\u00a0 While we were very inspired by what we\u2019d heard about jazz kissas and that whole tradition, we never made the trek before the pandemic.\u00a0And when we really got serious about building Eavesdrop, travel restrictions prevented us from being able to see those places.\u00a0We absolutely would have if we could, but I think in a way it turned out to be a blessing.\u00a0Rather than trying to recreate a concept from someone else\u2019s culture, we tried to take inspiration from it while building something that we felt would work in our community.\u00a0We were careful to nod to jazz kissas in various ways.\u00a0I\u2019d point out the food in particular: Max (Partner, Head of Food and Beverage) is half Japanese, and it shows in his food. But at the same time, we were careful not to try toimitateJapanese places \u2013 we just didn\u2019t feel we had the credentials to do that.\nThe traditional non-speaking type of listening bar is obviously something difficult to achieve in New York and the United States in general. How does Eavesdrop approach the listening bar concept, and how has it played out with visitors?\nIn a lot of ways this is the million dollar question for our concept, and it matters a lot to the DJs, the music heads, and the audiophile community. Rather than trying to enforce a strict no-talking rule, we try to cater an experience that limits noise naturally.\u00a0Guests are encouraged to make reservations, and we don\u2019t allow big groups.\u00a0Booths and tables are cozy and intimate \u2013 you\u2019re never more than whispering distance from the folks in your party. We investedheavilyin acoustic treatment: there is diffusio`n, but an extra emphasis on absorption.\u00a0All this leads to an environment where one never needs to shout to be heard.\u00a0The DJ is right in the room with you \u2013 there\u2019s no \u201cbooth\u201d area, and when the set starts we change the lighting, which usually creates a bit of a hush and a shift of attention.\nIt\u2019s not perfect, and we do occasionally ask loud guests to please quiet down, but we\u2019re trying to get the vibe to feel like that living room experience rather than a hi-fi temple. I think this strikes a nice balance that works for all our guests, from the audiophiles to the neighborhood happy hour crowd, the folks deep in the music scene as well as the \u201clistening-bar-curious\u201d, if you will.\nIt looks like there\u2019s an array of custom speakers and equipment that make up the gorgeous soundsystem at Eavesdrop. What can you say about the soundsystem (builders, parts, brands, etc.)?\nThe entire room, from the sound system to the acoustic treatment to the millwork and furniture, was designed by Danny Taylor of House Under Magic.\u00a0I think it\u2019s really important to start that way, by saying that the whole thing was designed cohesively, rather than having one person do the sound system, another do the treatment, and a third do the interior design.\u00a0 I think that\u2019s really the magic of what makes Eavesdrop work, and for the most part we like for people to just get immersed in it rather than thinking about technical specs, equipment, materials, and such.\u00a0 That said, it\u2019s always fun to talk a little tech!\nThe mains are two Danley SH60s which Danny took apart, customized a bit, and then painted.\u00a0Hidden below are two Seaton Submersive S2 subs.\u00a0The Danleys have seven drivers and each S2 has a pair of 15s.\u00a0They\u2019re powered by Bryston 7B SSTs, the kind of thing you\u2019d typically find in a recording studio.\u00a0The Mastersounds Radius 4v mixer adds some nice character.\u00a0It\u2019s all carefully tuned by Danny, and most importantly it faces a custom-built diffusion wall.\u00a0We built a soffit over a booth in the back corner to house a bass trap, and there\u2019s treatment all over the ceiling. The Danleys are very directional, so every seat in the room sounds a little different, but they all sound good.\nA few of our close friends are resident selectors at Eavesdrop. Is there a theme or direction with the music played in this space? Can you highlight a few of the other selectors who have residencies?\nOur goal with the booking is to pull from all the various scenes and sub-genres that New York has to offer, but to hear how that scene treats a listening environment like Eavesdrop.\u00a0 We want to hear all different genres, but what\u2019s played should of course be selected to suit the environment.\u00a0 You can hear anything from jazz to techno at Eavesdrop \u2013 you just won\u2019t hear DJs play the same records they\u2019d play in the club at three in the morning in a club.\u00a0Everyone does such a nice job it\u2019s hard to name anyone in particular.\nWhat are some albums/tracks that have really worked in the space and capture the vibe of Eavesdrop?\nThis one is really a matter of personal taste, but I tend to really love late \u201990s era downtempo and trip-hop.\u00a0Things that are well-produced, bassy but not outrageously so, mostly electronic but in a way that\u2019s more lush and atmospheric rather than angular or robotic.\u00a0Ulrich Schnauss\u2019sFar Away Trains Passing Byis maybe my all time favorite record for our room and it fits that profile very well.\nI\u2019ve read that you also do more industry related events during the week with labels, artists, and record stores. Any recent highlights you\u2019d like to share?\nFor Monday and Tuesday nights, when there\u2019s no DJ, we had two of our favorite record stores put together a selection of LPs that the bartender will play from a turntable by the bar.The Mixtape Shophas Monday\u2019s andBrooklyn Record Exchangeis on Tuesday.\u00a0Brian and Ben each did a fantastic job and I really encourage people to come check out those nights.\nWe\u2019ve got a listening event coming up September 15th for Au Suisse\u2019s self titled album on City Slang records.\u00a0Eavesdrop is such a nice environment for a record release, so we\u2019re trying to do more of those.\u00a0We have a few in the works, but nothing I can announce just yet!\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "title": "Understanding Speaker Frequency Response",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/understanding-speaker-frequency-response/",
        "content": "Here\u2019s an essential archival article from Paul Diacomo, a brilliant writer and longtime Polk Audio executive who published many classic articles on hi-fi throughout the years. We are publishing it again here in the hope that a new generation of readers finds great value in his writing.\nHere\u2019s a quick quiz: which of these two speakers sounds better: Speaker A with a frequency response range of 45Hz to 18kHz or, Speaker B with a range of 20Hz to 25kHz? The truth is there\u2019s simply not enough data in these numbers to know anything of value. Taken out of context and without other data, a simple set of numbers don\u2019t tell you much about real world sound quality. But people make audio buying decisions based on published specifications, such as the frequency response spec, everyday. I\u2019d like to demystify the process for you; let you in on a little industry secret about \u201cThe Frequency Response Spec.\u201d\nThe Frequency Response specification attempts to describe the range of frequencies or musical tones a speaker can reproduce, measured in Hertz (known to old-timers as \u201cCycles per Second\u201d). The range of human hearing is generally regarded as being from 20Hz, very low bass tones, through 20kHz (20,000Hz), the very highest treble. Presumably a speaker that could reproduce that range would sound lifelike. Alas, it is no guarantee. The most important determinant of a speaker\u2019s frequency performance is not its width or range, but whether it\u2019s capable of reproducing all the audible frequencies at the same volume at which they were recorded.\nYou don\u2019t want the speaker to change the \u201cmix\u201d of tones; that would ruin the timbre of voices and instruments, making them sound unnatural. Ideally, you want the sounds that are on the recording to be reproduced as they were recorded, without the speaker changing the sound. To say it another way: if you made a recording of all the audible tones at the same volume and played that recording through a speaker, you\u2019d want all the audible tones to come out at the same volume. In fact, that\u2019s one way of measuring speakers. A signal that\u2019s comprised of all frequencies at equal volume is fed into a speaker that sits in a room with no reflective surfaces. A calibrated microphone is placed in front of the speaker and feeds the speaker\u2019s output into a machine that plots the frequency vs. amplitude as shown in Figure A.\nNow take a look at the graph in Figure B. That\u2019s the frequency response of the Erehwon Model 10, with drivers and tweeters made of pure Unobtainium (\u201cHalf the carbs, all the sound!\u201d). The flat line on the graph indicates that the speaker is \u201cflat\u201d; it reproduces all the musically relevant tones at the same volume. That doesn\u2019t mean that a \u201cflat\u201d speaker will play all recorded sounds at the same volume \u2014 bear with me here \u2014 it means that it will treat all sounds equally; it won\u2019t impose its will on the music but will allow you to hear the music as it was recorded. Flat is good. Flat response means that the speaker reproduces sound accurately.\nA big improvement would be a frequency response number that also includes the amplitude tolerance, expressed as \u201cXHz-YkHz +/- 3dB.\u201d This tells you that the amplitude of the speaker\u2019s response relative to frequency does not deviate more than 3 Decibels from the center line. The \u201cplus or minus 3dB\u201d spec is regarded as a standard of sorts. The theory is that 3dB differences are \u201cjust perceptible,\u201d so a speaker whose response curve lies within that tolerance window is a reasonably accurate speaker. Let\u2019s see if that idea holds water.\nIf I had to choose strictly by the response curves, I\u2019d choose speaker D because its amplitude variations are smoother and gentler. In contrast, speaker C\u2019s amplitude variations are more extreme and \u201cspikey.\u201d Experience has shown speaker designers that those rapid changes in response produce a sound that is more fatiguing, less pleasing and subjectively less accurate.\nNow that you know the importance (and limitations) of amplitude variations in frequency response graphs, you might ask: \u201cdoes the frequency range tell us anything at all?\u201d Yes, it does. As long as you know the amplitude tolerance (+/- 3dB), the frequency response range or width tells you how high or low the speaker goes. A speaker rated as 20Hz \u2013 25kHz +/- 3dB will play lower bass and higher treble sounds than a speaker that measures 40Hz \u2013 20kHz +/- 3dB. I wouldn\u2019t bet money that it would be the better, more enjoyable speaker, but at least I\u2019d know something of value.\nAnd now that you know how to interpret these numbers, you\u2019re ready to run right out and buy a speaker just by looking at the response curve, right? I wouldn\u2019t recommend it. Despite many advances in technology over the past 20 years,frequency response measurement is an imperfect science. The same speaker measured by two different labs may yield different response graphs. And some companies just plain cheat when they publish response curves. If it looks hand drawn, it probably was.(Yes, the graphs were hand drawn for illustration purposes.)\nThe Third DimensionSo far we\u2019ve talked about frequency (the X axis of the graph) and amplitude (Y axis) but we left out an important third dimension: time. When a speaker responds to an impulse, for example a rim shot \u2014 \u201cTHWACK!\u201d \u2014 it should start instantly and stop the instant the instrument stops making sound. If the speaker keeps vibrating or resonating and making sound after the source sound stops it\u2019s changing, or \u201ccoloring,\u201d the sound of the original recording. And that\u2019s bad.\nFigure F shows a bandwidth limited impulse signal. You can see that it starts and stops abruptly. Figure G shows that same impulse coming out of a speaker. You can see that the sound persists after the impulse input has stopped \u2014 it resonates or \u201crings.\u201d The speaker is changing the timbre or character of the original recording. In order to see to what extent and at which frequencies the \u201cringing\u201d is happening, we use a sophisticated computer algorithm called MLLSA (affectionately called \u201cMelissa\u201d by engineers who don\u2019t date much) to measure the response of a speaker in frequency, amplitude and time. Figure H is a MLLSA spectral decay graph of a prototype speaker. The third axis of this graph is time, so graph lines closest to you are measurements taken later than the ones in the back. Think of it as a series of slices with each slice being a frequency response graph taken at a different point in time.\nIf we were to measure the perfect speaker the MLLSA graph would look like a straight line in back with no lines in front. Real speakers fall far short of this ideal and continue to resonate after an impulse has stopped, such as in Figure H. Figure I is a Polk LSi9, and we can see that the speaker stops responding sooner in the midrange than the speaker pictured in Figure H, indicating that the LSi9 is a better sounding speaker.\nWhile no measurement technique can fully describe the subjective sound of a loudspeaker, MLLSA and other frequency response measurements are of great help to Polk engineers in developing better sounding speakers. Only a fool would design a speaker based on measurements alone and only a total fool would design a speaker based solely on subjective listening. A speaker that might sound good on a particular recording may in fact be flawed \u2013 it may have what is commonly called a \u201ceuphonic coloration.\u201d It may be pleasing to the ear under certain conditions, but it sure ain\u2019t right.\nWe use both measurements and subjective listening to design and evaluate speakers. The measurements save us time and are a great help in pointing us in the right design direction, avoiding mistakes that may come back to bite us later. The measurements give us a means of selecting which experimental designs are worth listening to.\nBut we have to be satisfied with the total subjective experience before a new design becomes aPolk Audio speaker. We spend countless hours listening to music and movies. Several experienced listeners have to listen to a proposed design and sign off on the sound before a model can even go into production. The Project Manager, Systems Engineer, VP of Engineering, Product Line Manager, and especially Matthew Polk, all have to agree that the prototype delivers the kind of rewarding listening experience that you expect from Polk Audio.\nYou now know the secret: a frequency response specification is a very weak predictor of the actual performance of a loudspeaker.A frequency response chart can be more helpful, but it\u2019s missing the important time measurement. You now know to look for overall curve smoothness and to avoid rapid swings in amplitude. Some magazines and review sites publish MLSSA graphs of reviewed speakers, and now you\u2019ll understand how to interpret them. More power to you!\nNo matter how adept you might be at interpreting frequency response data, it should only be one data point among many in choosing a speaker. There is so much more to a speaker\u2019s performance than just its response \u2013 like its dispersion and imaging, dynamic range and detail resolution as well as size, cosmetics and price. Looking at good frequency response data can help you eliminate speakers with obvious and obnoxious errors. Once you\u2019ve eliminated the boom & tizz pseudo-fi speakers, you can settle down to careful listening and making a more informed choice.\nPolk Audio publishes two frequency response specifications: \u201cOverall\u201d and \u201c-3dB.\u201d \u201cOverall\u201d describes the frequency range limits of the speaker within an amplitude drop off of 9dB. Any frequency reproduced more than 9dB down from the rest of the frequencies will contribute little to the sound. The \u201c-3dB\u201d spec describes the frequency range limits of the speaker within an amplitude drop off of 3dB.\nI just wrote this big article making the case that these kinds of numbers are not terribly useful in making buying decisions. So why does Polk use them? For better or for worse, these numbers are the norm in the audio industry.\nTo not publish them would leave an impression that our products were not competitive. A better question would be: why don\u2019t we publish frequency response and MLSSA graphs in addition to the simple numbers? We feel that these graphs would not be meaningful to the vast majority of consumers.\nIt takes years of working with measurements and loudspeakers before you get a good sense of how the graphs correlate to subjective sound quality. Incorrect interpretation of graphs can easily lead to misinformation and bad choices. Finally, the variation in measurement techniques can make comparing graphs from two different labs or manufacturers unreliable and misleading.\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission."

        "title": "The Best Record Cleaning Solutions: Exit to Vintage Street",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/record-cleaning-solutions/",
        "content": "When I went to Japan as an ESL teacher in my mid-20s, it marked not only a change of location and culture, but also a change from student to working adult (and I use the term \u201cadult\u201d loosely). With that change from student to worker came the need to buy a professional wardrobe, and as a poor recent graduate on a tight budget, that meant careful planning of items to be purchased pre-departure.\nDress pants, dress shirts, a blue blazer, dress shoes and several ties. All good, right? Unfortunately not. I arrived in the Land of Rising Tech sans belt, socks, tie-pin/bar (discovered I hated flappy ties), and overcoat (Sapporo in April can still be pretty chilly). I had most of the basics but felt incomplete for my first month or so until I got paid and could complete the wardrobe with necessary accessories.\nSo too for many of us audio lovers in our adventures setting up first systems or adding to existing ones. We plan out the budget, divvy it up by percentages for speakers and amp(s) and source(s), and think we\u2019re done. Then a few weeks (or months) later we find ourselves with multiple components stacked on top of each other on top of a turned over milk carton, speakers that don\u2019t sound right as they\u2019re not placed correctly and records that sound awful after a few plays as we\u2019ve nothing to clean them with.\nThis week and next I\u2019m going to take a tour through some of the accessories I\u2019ve picked up (and some that I haven\u2019t \u2013 yet) since getting into vintage audio and back into vinyl. Some I\u2019d classify as optional, but most are requirements if you really want to get the most out of your system, whether budget or high end. This week I\u2019m going to focus on clean records and improving the quality of your vinyl playback.\nA clean record sounds better. It also does something very important \u2013it extends the life of your cartridge.\nThe simplest record cleaner, great for dry environments, especially in winter. An anti-static brush reduces static and removes dust particles from your record before play. Mine is made byAudio Technica, but there are dozens of models out there. If you\u2019re wet cleaning your records every few plays or on a periodic basis, the anti-static brush should be enough to keep your records pop free in between deep cleanings. It won\u2019t clean very dirty records but is a good regular maintenance tool for your vinyl.\nI remember that in high school my mom used aDiscwashercleaning brush, and this was one of the first accessories I picked up for myself. This is basically a directional velvet-covered pad attached to a nice ergonomic wooden body. Spray some fluid on the leading edge of the velvet pad, wipe and and twist the brush in the direction of the grooves for a few rotations, and you have a nice clean record. It will never deliver the same level of cleaning as a record cleaning machine, but it\u2019s something.\nNot required every spin, but good every few plays. The old ones (from the \u201870s and \u201880s) had a nifty hollow in the hardwood body that held the little cleaning fluid bottle. In a cost-cutting effort (no doubt), the wood is lighter and cheaper, and the hollow is no more. Still a must-have item.\nThere are several different solutions for serious cleaning of records, costing into the thousands of dollars. An ultrasonic cleaner (like those from Degritter or CleanerVinyl) or a vacuum cleaner (Okki Nokki and Pro-Ject VC-S are quite well known) will do a superb job but may be an investment too far for someone just getting started. VPI have been manufacturing record cleaning machines for almost 40 years with the entry-level model running almost $700.\nThe Library of Congress in Washington D.C. was using the top VPI model for its work in regard to the National Archives but we\u2019re talking about a unit that runs over $3,000 and was being used to clean thousands of records. A robust unit for sure but probably not for the average collector.\nRecord cleaning machines are very noisy. Our Editor-in-Chief, Ian White uses both a VPI HW-19 andRecord Doctor VI(we\u2019re giving one away later this month) in his laundry room at home because it is far away from the rest of the house where it can be heard even with the television on. Both machines also have to be emptied after each batch of records; their respective reservoirs can only hold a limited amount of dirty water and cleaning solution.\nThere is no shortage of record cleaning fluids on the market and just as many opinions in regard to which solution cleans the best and does the least damage to your records. There are various means of applying and rinsing off the (straight or diluted) fluid and then drying the record.\nI opted for a simple, manualSpinClean\u00a0Mk. IIrecord bath. At well under a hundred bucks, the price was right, and I have to say I\u2019ve been impressed with the results. The Spin Clean has a narrow bath section, cleaning pads on each side, and roller guides at each end; fill the bath section with water, put in a capful of cleaning fluid, insert a record between the pads and spin clockwise and counter-clockwise three times each, then remove and dry with the supplied towels. Do enough records in one session and you can dispense with the daily workout.\nI buy a lot of records on Discogs, and the first thing I do when they arrive is give them a thorough cleaning. Early on I wasn\u2019t doing this, and I had records that played at a G+ or VG level jump up a couple of grading points after I did finally give them a good bath and towel-off. This I consider one of my best accessory buys.\nTo me there doesn\u2019t seem to be much point to cleaning your records if your cartridge stylus is dirty. Over time, any dirt and gunk you haven\u2019t managed to remove from your records (with whatever cleaning method you\u2019re using) gets carved out and builds up on the stylus. This in turn can result in a) reverse transfer of dirt back to your records from the stylus, and b) impact on vibration of the stylus in the record grooves and thus the sound emitted by your cartridge.\nAs I mentioned previously, a dirty cartridge doesn\u2019t last very long and with re-tip prices getting rather expensive, it takes only a few seconds to carefully clean your stylus. The simplest stylus cleaning solution is a stylus brush (these cost next to nothing), but overzealous or faulty use of the brush could result in damage to the stylus. If you do opt for a brush always brush parallel to the stylus from back to front. Never the other way, and never sideways.\nFor the vinyl lover, I\u2019d classify all four of these accessories as essential. Having a clean front end to your vinyl system (the records and your stylus) will extend the life of both records and stylus and maximise the quality of sound transmitted to the rest of your system. A basic collection of anti-static, cleaning and stylus brushes will set you back around $50. My set of four comes in at a bit under $200. Whatever solution you settle for, a small investment now will reap rewards in the long run.\nNext week we\u2019ll look at a few more accessories that, though perhaps less essential, can have a big impact on enjoyment of your audio journey. If you have any accessory suggestions, leave a comment, or message me on Instagram at@audioloveyyc.\nMore Vinyl Playback Articles:5 Best Vinyl Accessories to Upgrade Your Record Listening\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission."

        "title": "Klipsch KLF-30 Speakers: Exit to Vintage Street",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/klipsch-klf-30/",
        "content": "On March 15thI had the opportunity to hear my second ever pair of Klipsch loudspeakers. In a great example of the virtual becoming reality, an Instagram friend Scott (@scotty_scotchdog, who I had never met in person) invited myself and fellow IG friend Kevin (@mistachen, who I also first met on Instagram and then a couple of times in person), to a Scotch tasting/audio testing party.\nLocal audio store owner Kurt (@the_audio_room, who I\u2019d met a few times at the store) provided the audio equipment in the form of Hegel and NAD DAC/amplifiers for a head-to-head shootout, with Scott\u2019s Klipsch KLF-30 speakers providing the familiar (to him) sound output.\nScott had found me through my whisky Instagram account, and through that I\u2019d discovered his KLF ownership. Pure#AudioPornspeakers. We had messaged back-and-forth quite a bit, with him asking for Scotch recommendations, and had plenty of discussions about audio components, speakers and music. I was glad to finally meet Scott, and see Kevin and Kurt again, but part of me was just there to finally hear the Klipsch KLF-30 speakers.\nI\u2019d been curious about Klipsch, and particularly the popular, retro-styled \u201cHeritage\u201d Series (Heresy, Forte, Cornwall, La Scala and Klipschorn) since getting into vintage audio. The first and only Klipsch I had heard up to that point were theQuartets(1989-96), which I had owned for a little over a year. Though not officially Heritage speakers, they were a fit looks-wise; like a big Heresy with deeper bass (10\u201d woofer and 12\u201d rear passive, as opposed to the Heresy\u2019s 12\u201d woofer).\nI loved the look of the Quartets, but\u00a0never could get them to sound right with the equipment I had at the time. They were good with jazz, chamber music, acoustic \u2013 anything detailed and textured, without too much going on \u2013 but with louder, more complex rock or orchestral music, output lost cohesion and came across as dry and harsh. I raised them, adjusted toe-in, moved them closer to the rear wall and then farther out, changed my seating position; no matter what I did, there was something off.\nI had not purchased a tube amp yet (Klipsch and tubes are a heaven-made match, but my Dynaco ST-70 was still a year in the future), but in retrospect feel that could have been an answer.\nScott\u2019s KLFs were a different story. Whether with Hegel or NAD, they sounded big, and there was an abundance of bass. I\u2019m not a bass-head, but I do like a solid low end and the KLF-30 had it in spades. There was also a good balance between bass, midrange and treble that was true no matter what we listened to. They sounded cohesive and I loved them.\nA mind expanded by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions.\nThe sad thing about an experience like the evening at Scott\u2019s is that I had a new audio benchmark, and I spent the next few weeks comparing the sound of my own speakers to that. My dissatisfaction with the Quartets only grew. I let Scott know that if he ever decided to get rid of his KLFs, I wanted first dibs. He told me it was unlikely, but that yes, I\u2019d be first in line.\nNot only do the Klipsch\u00a0KLF-30 sound big; they are big, standing 115cm tall (45\u201d) and weighing a burly 46.3kg (102 lbs). Part of the Legend Series (30, 20, 10 and C7 centre) introduced in 1996 and manufactured until 2001, the Klipsch KLF-30 feature a three-way driver system with 1\u201d K-79 tweeter compression driver (with 90\u02da x 40\u02da exponential horn), 1.5\u201d K-52 midrange compression driver (with 90\u02da x 60\u02da Tractrix Horn\u00ae) and two 12\u201d K-31 woofers (with oversize magnet structure).\nFrequency response is a very decent 36Hz to 20 kHz, and sensitivity is (rated) 102 dB @ 1 watt/1 meter, and nominal impedance is 8 ohms. On paper, a speaker which will play well with anything.\nI got it in my mind that I should get something tall with a big box like the KLFs. If I couldn\u2019t have the real thing, I wanted something close. Soon after the mind-expanding evening, I found a set of ESS PS4As advertised on Kijiji (Canada\u2019s Craigslist). Double 10\u201d woofers (one active, one passive) and small Heil AMT (Air Motion Transformer) ribbon tweeter.\nNot as big box-wise as the KLF-30s, but still on the larger side at 99cm tall (39\u201d). Rated similarly at 35Hz to 24kHz, and sensitivity of 96 dB @ 1 watt/3 feet and a 6 ohms impedance.\nI tried them out and liked what I heard (not as big sounding as the KLFs, but adequate levels of bass, great balance and sweet midrange and highs). They came home with me, and the Quartets were quickly sold on. Ironically, they guy who bought the Quartets brought over an old Marantz 2230 receiver to test them with, and the Quartets never sounded better to my ears. Goes to show the importance of synergy.\nA bit over a year on and a few months into the pandemic, Scott messaged me. \u201cDo you still want my KLFs?\u201d He was taking the plunge on some Tannoy loudspeakers and the Klipsch KLF-30 speakers were now surplus to requirements. Did I still want the KLFs? I was mighty happy with my ESS, but dammit yes, I wanted these legends. A deal was struck, and a few days later Scott and I lugged two 102 lb monsters down into my basement and they were mine. All mine.\nAnd now, a year on, what do I think? Do the Klipsch KLF-30 speakers play well with everything? I would have to say yes. I\u2019ve run them in all kinds of set-ups and combinations; and while they do sound different, they always sound good. Very good.\nWith the diminutive Sansui AU-555, rated at 20 watts/channel and damping factor\u00a0(control over the movement of the speaker cone, particularly in the bass region)\u00a0set to high (45), the sound is big and beefy. This is with the volume pot set to somewhere between 2 and 3. Bass is solid with good slam and control.\nThe midrange and highs are detailed, and extension is excellent. Overall tonal balance is spot on, and I\u2019d be happy enough with this combination if it was the only system available to me. Proof that an efficient speaker with a low-powered amp can work extremely well, with no compromise to sound quality.\nWith the bigger Sansui AU-999, rated at 50 watts/channel and a damping factor of 45, output is similar. A bit cleaner and leaner, with less beef. More refined and \u201caudiophile.\u201d Many 999 owners lament (somewhat) a lack of bass punch and here that reputation is born out; this is no fault of the KLF-30. That said, this combination is still very satisfying and extremely musical.\nThrow the 35 watts/channel Dynaco ST-70 tube power amp into the mix with the AU-999 operating in preamp mode, and magic starts to happen. The Dynaco adds warmth, and a pinch more low end than the 999 alone. Bass is thick without being flabby, with impactful dynamics and speed (there\u2019s thwack to the attack). Midrange and treble are well defined and balanced, neither recessed nor forward. The Klipsch-plus-tubes adage is very, very true and the result is something I could listen to \u2018til the cows come home. Wonderfully balanced with just the right amount of presence and size.\nThe one KLF-30 spec that I have yet to mention is output power; nominal 200 watts and maximum 800 watts each. These things can handle a lot of juice. So, out of curiosity, we replace the Sansui/Dynaco pairing with a NAD solid state combo of 3020 (as pre-amp) and a 150 watts/channel 2600 power amp. Damping\u00a0factor of 100. For bass-heads, this\u00a0is where you want to be. Attack and decay of the low end are incredibly defined; there\u2019s thunder with no flab at all. The midrange and treble are still very balanced sounding but more dynamic and engaging. Not something I do much, but volume can be turned way up, and the speakers maintain composure. Efficient yes, but also very muscular.\nSuffice it to say, I am 100% satisfied with the Klipsch KLF-30 speakers. Actually \u2014 99.9%. Every now and then, the vintage-purist, OCD part of my brain whispers, \u201c1996 is not vintage; your speakers are too new!\u201d Many define vintage audio as being manufactured pre-1985 (while in the automobile world anything older than 25 years is vintage). If the KLF-30s were cars, the first ones off the line would now just fall in the vintage category. As audio equipment, they\u2019re a decade too late.\nWhat to do? What to do? Perhaps a set of 2ndgeneration Fortes or Cornwalls are in my future. Probably Cornwalls\u2026"

        "title": "Iconic Sansui Amplifiers: Exit to Vintage Street",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/iconic-sansui-amplifiers/",
        "content": "In my last year of high school, my brother came home one day with an old integrated amplifier. His boss at his part-time job (where he stripped and refinished old furniture) was clearing out his basement and gave it to him. Surplus to requirements.\nI had a system of my own already but do remember thinking it looked somewhat cool. Black brushed metal face plate. Silver knobs. Black selector switches. Homemade wood case. Even then, in the early \u201880s, it was a retro-looking piece.\nNot sure how much use that old amp got as my brother wasn\u2019t a huge music nut. I was never aware of him having speakers or other equipment to use it with. He had a monster JVC ghetto blaster that probably got more use. I went off to university the following year and didn\u2019t think about it again.\nFast forward 35 years. I get an email from my brother asking about the best way to get rid of his old amp. Photo attached. Sansui AU-555. At this point I\u2019m justgetting (back) into vintage audio. \u201cBest way is to give it to me\u201d was my immediate, excited reply. And so it came to me, and after a short stay withThat Old Retro Storegetting checked over and re-capped, became part of my then small but growing vintage audio set-up.\nJapanese audio was hot from the late 1960s to the early 1980s. With quality high and prices low, North American consumers bought up equipment from brands like Pioneer, Sony, Technics, Sansui, Kenwood and others by the truckload. And now, with the resurgent popularity of vintage audio, these brands are again hot commodities.\nIn my mind,Sansuiis the iconic vintage Japanese audio brand. Luxman and Accuphase fans might object to that statement and I can\u2019t disagree from a quality perspective \u2013 but we\u2019re talking about a different level of affordability. Few Japanese audio brands have the same, close-to-rabid following, particularly when it comes to integrated amplifiers and receivers. Yes, they made respectable tuners, speakers and turntables, but amplification was their jam; the proof-in-the pudding is reflected in today\u2019s rarity (they\u2019re around, but folks don\u2019t like to part with their treasures) and high prices when they do come up for sale.\nSansui Electric was established in 1947 and released their first tube\u00a0amplifier into the market in 1954. Several other amplifiers and receivers followed, but it wasn\u2019t until 1965 that they really made a mark with the AU-111 tube pre-main (integrated) amplifier,\u00a0known as the \u201cblack panel ancestor.\u201d At 40 watts per channel, the AU-111 was something of a powerhouse for its time, and it would stay in production into the early 1970s. To buy an AU-111 now takes crazy money.\nIn 1967, Sansui introduced their first solid-state integrated amplifier, the AU-777. This was followed in 1969 with several other models in the XXX series, including the AU-555 and the AU-999. Release dates are hard to pin down as individual models were introduced haphazardly (not in organized series groupings), but rough estimates have:\nSeveral series of receivers were also released in the late \u201860s and through the \u201870s, including the venerable 800 in 1968, The \u201csingle digit\u201d series (Eight, Seven and Six) in 1973, XX1 series (881, 771, 661, etc.) in 1974, 9090 in 1975, other X0X0s (8080, 7070, etc.) in 1977, and the G-series receivers starting in 1978 and through to about 1982.\nAs the \u201880s approached, business took a downward turn for Sansui. The Yen appreciated in value, impacting sales of export models (on which Sansui had become highly dependent). Strong unions and a tradition of \u201clifetime employment\u201d in Japan made it hard to cut manufacturing staff to deal with cost pressures. Corners were cut elsewhere, including use of cheaper, lower-quality parts.\nQuality took a hit, as did Sansui\u2019s reputation, and sales fell further. Sansui shifted away from exports to focus on their domestic market, and slowly unravelled over the ensuing two decades. Sansui went out of business in 2014, but in truth had not been a force in the audio world for some 20 or more years before that.\nIn addition to the AU-555 passed on to me by my brother, I also own a \u201ctop of the XXX line\u201d AU-999, purchased on eBay about a year after getting the 555. I\u2019d read about the wonderful tube-like sound of the 999 and lucked into one in good cosmetic condition at a reasonable price from a local seller, so no need to worry about shipping damage or added costs for this 38.5 lb (17.5 kg) monster to get to me (the seller even delivered it to my office downtown). I count myself lucky as I\u2019ve watched this model almost double in price in the four years I\u2019ve had it.\nAs mentioned, the AU-555 needed a recap to get it running properly. In the five years since coming back from the shop, it has been rock solid. This 20 watts/channel amplifier (all you really needed in the early \u201870s driving efficient speakers, the norm for the times) has a big and beefy sound, with solid bass slam and control, and balanced detailed midrange and decent treble extension.\nI\u2019ve run the AU-555 in both integrated (pre-main) and pre-amp (through an external power amp) modes. As an integrated amp I\u2019ve runKlipsch KLF-30s, ESS PS4As and B&W DM1200s with no trouble, and the sound quality was wonderful. The juice-lovingKEF Calinda\u2019s(83 dB @ 1 watt/1 meter efficiency) present perhaps a challenge-too-far for this little amp, but that\u2019s a common issue even with my higher-powered amps.\nIn pre-amp mode with my 150 watts/channel NAD 2600, the AU-555 performs well, particularly with the KEFs. I\u2019ve also run the AU-555 as pre-amp with the 35 watts/channel Dynaco ST-70 tube amp. The little Sansui\u2019s pre-out is quite hot, so gain on the NAD needs to be dialed back to allow for fine volume adjustment and full-range use of the volume pot beyond an ear-blasting 2. With the Dynaco, gain can\u2019t be controlled in this way, so things get loud pretty quick.\nAlthough good things are written about how clear and tubey the AU-999 sounds \u2013 realistic presentation of room ambiance and dynamics, pearlescent midrange, and smooth, warm and organic acoustics overall \u2013 it also has a reputation for a lean low end. It\u2019s definitely\u00a0cleaner-sounding than the 555 \u2013 more refined and \u201caudiophile\u201d \u2013 but in its native state does have less bass slam.\nThe 999 was a different story service-wise. Not long after I got it, I started to notice some crackle in both channels at low volumes or when nothing was playing. Not surprising really with an almost 50 year-old amp. I figured I\u2019d probably need to take it in for a service soon when I bought it, and so in it went.\nTurns out it needed more than just a simple recap (although some capacitors were replaced). The amp suffered from a pretty severe channel imbalance, which was rectified with a new volume pot and replacement of the output transistors. As per mod discussion (KevZep) onAudioKarma, the subsonic filter was removed, and some other circuit tweaks were done to improve bass and clarity. The result was a more muscular sounding 999, benching 55+ watts/channel and with better (still not massive, but improved) bass response.\nI\u2019ve used the AU-999 in similar set-ups to the AU-555, with the same speakers and as pre-amp with the same power amplifiers. On its own (in integrated mode) it has a more audiophile presentation than the 555 with less \u201cthickness.\u201d It displays more authority with the inefficient KEF Calinda\u2019s, but I prefer it combined with the NAD 2600 with those speakers. I like the AU-999 in integrated amp mode but love it as a pre-amp both with the Dynaco ST-70 and the NAD; both power amplifiers negate any bass deficiencies and allow the wonderful musicality of the Sansui to shine through.\nIn spite of \u201cissues,\u201d I\u2019m very satisfied with my AU-999. I love the AU-555 too, but it doesn\u2019t get a lot of use these days; I keep it more for nostalgic reasons than anything (a topic I plan to address in a future article).\nI haven\u2019t heard any of the other Sansui products from their golden age, but there are several that have piqued my interest. Of the XXX range, I understand the AU-777 (or more precisely the AU-777A) is the one to own from a pure sonic perspective. The AU-9500 is also desirable for its combination of sonic purity, clean appearance and power (75 old-school watts/channel is pretty solid for an integrated amp).\nFor pure power and refinement, I\u2019d love one of the BA series (3000 or 5000) power amplifiers to use with the AU-999 as pre-amp, or one of the CA (control amplifier) range of pre-amplifiers. And then of course, the ultimate would be the one that really started it all for Sansui: the AU-111\u00a0pre-main tube amplifier. That would be a blast!\nWhat else should I consider? Would love your input on an expanded wish list.

        "title": "The Vintage Marantz Dilemma: The Budget Audiophiler",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/vintage-marantz-dilemma/",
        "content": "Vintage Marantz components have seen some dramatic price increases of late and there is an increasing amount of debate on whether or not those prices are warranted. Supply and demand plays a huge part in all of this because nobody is manufacturing this equipment anymore; I think it\u2019s fair to say that vintage Marantz gear is more popular than the current lineup.\nMarantz made some excellent equipment during specific periods and there is a specific aesthetic that clearly appeals to a lot of music listeners and people who appreciate the industrial design.\nI have a Marantz 2245 and since I purchased it almost three years ago, the prices have doubled and for some examples in mint condition \u2014 even tripled. The aesthetic of the 2200 Series is no doubt iconic with its silver face, black accents, blue/green lighting and of course the fonts. The sound is always described as the \u201cwarm Marantz sound.\u201d\nThe 2245 features the standard equalizer adjustments of the time but also a midrange adjustment dial as well. I am personally a fan of the mid adjustment dial, because with the music that I listen to, it can bring the vocals a little more forward in the mix.\nIt also delivers 45 watts/channel and was designed to properly drive the loudspeakers of the period. Marantz were smart enough to include preamp outputs so that users could add an external power amplifier to their system.\nPutting all of those accolades aside, vintage Marantz equipment has pushed away from the dock and is no longer \u201cbudget\u201d which means that we need to explore some alternatives.\nDo they exist?\nThey certainly do and let\u2019s move on to some solid-state alternatives between $250-$500.\nThe first alternatives are the mid-\u201870s Harman Kardon Twin Power 730 or 430 models that I discussed inthis article. Both units are really solid options if you can find one in excellent shape.\nThe oldest model on my list is theHeathkit AR-1500A; which had its debut in 1967 (as the AR-15) and was a very hefty piece of steel weighing almost 35 pounds. The 60 watts/channel amplifier was sold in both kit form and prebuilt direct from the factory.\nThe specific model in my collection came from the factory and sold for $650 plus an additional $35 for the optional wood case in 1971. That\u2019s an astonishing $4,303 in 2021. For a Heathkit.\nThe tonal balance is rather warm and almost tube-like in its presentation.\nA bit of perspective, I normally listen to vintage equipment with the loudness button on, the bass dialed back, and treble tilted slightly higher.\nI rarely have to do this with the Heathkit; it\u2019s far bolder sounding than you might expect.\nThe styling of the Heathkit is certainly that of the late 1960\u2019s and the bulbs behind the green tuner display may benefit from an LED update to brighten the dial.\nOverall, I have been quite surprised with the build quality and sound from this unit. I think I would be hard pressed to find anyone who wouldn\u2019t enjoy the sound from the Heathkit AR-1500A and expect to pay between $200-$250 for a unit in decent shape.\nI\u2019m calling the next alternative the \u201cDon\u201d because it looks like it could have come off the set ofMad Men.\nThe Bogen BR-360 (this particular model is the rare BR-360W with the decorator white cabinet and tangerine-accented panel) was manufactured in 1969 and this receiver delivers 60 watts/channel into 8 ohms. It has a bold look and I rather like the push buttons and linear slide control styling.\nIn real world performance, it has zero difficulty driving myOhm 3XO speakers. It\u2019s definitely more than enough for most vintage and modern speakers within limits; you can\u2019t drive a pair ofWilson Audio loudspeakerswith it.\nThe tonal balance and presentation are vintage solid-state; there is a similarity to the vintage Marantz 2200 Series, and it probably comes the closest of all of these suggestions.\nIn addition to the loudness and bass/treble adjustments, this model features a \u201cCrescendo\u201d control which Bogen states will electronically expand or compress the sound without distortion.\nFrom a visual perspective, the Bogen BR-360W is a very unique looking product and is now part of my permanent collection. I\u2019m also increasingly impressed with its clarity and overall tonal balance. Yes \u2013 I did purchase it because the industrial design is very unique, and it is the source of many questions from guests.\nAlthough somewhat rare, these can be found in the $200 range. Very few people know the Bogen product lineup, and this is definitely a strong budget purchase.\nMy final suggestion this week is a big departure from the models above that were offered in the 1960s and 1970s.\nThe Kyocera (they also make knives) R-861 is from the mid-1980s and a very interesting piece that clearly flew under the radar. This 100 watts/channel receiver has impressed me so much that it has earned a place in the system that we use the most in our home.\nThis is clearly a \u201cmodern\u201d design with the majority of its buttons and dials hidden behind a panel on the front of the unit. The tuner is digital and only a single red LED light indicates that it is powered on and which input has been selected.\nThe Kyocera R-861 offers the ability to adjust the bass, midrange, and treble and I found the range of adjustments to be quite useful. You can certainly keep the fairly neutral tonal balance as it is or add some warmth to the sound.\nBoth the CD and Phono inputs are gold plated.\nThe phono preamp is the biggest surprise with this unit; it works exceptionally well with the MM cartridges that I\u2019ve tried so far and might be the best part of the unit in terms of its sonic capabilities. It\u2019s clear that Kyocera\u2019s engineers still considered vinyl playback to be the most important source when this component was designed.\nI have also managed to find the matching CD player and remote control which makes operation of both components that much easier.\nThe only issue with the Kyocera R-861 is that word has already spread in the vintage audio community about the quality of this particular unit. You can still find a unit in good condition, but demand has begun to affect the prices; expect to pay $300-$400 right now.\nSo does that mean that you shouldn\u2019t look for vintage Marantz components? Absolutely not.\nJust be more realistic about what people are asking for their components and don\u2019t be disappointed if the prices push them out of reach right now.\nAll of the above picks or the HK 430/730 are worth searching for. Adjust the sound to your liking, or add an external amplifier (tube or solid state) to increase the output as all of the above can be used as a preamp with the exception of the Bogen BR-360W.\nYou may find a fantastic deal on a Marantz out there, but until then, these are some rock solid alternatives. Obviously these are not the only choices, post your favorite budget receivers in the comments!\nI\u2019d like to personally thank@retrodiggsfor providing me with the serviced Bogen and the Heathkit receivers.\nRelated reading:The Budget Audiophiler: Learning to Fly with the Pilot 602 Tube Receiver\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission."

        "content": "For this installment of \u201cBest Right Now,\u201d eCoustics Ian White sat down withTarun: A British Audiophileto discuss some of the best budget integrated amplifiers between $350 and $1,000 USD.\nBetween the two of them, they\u2019ve listened to at least 20 new integrated amplifiers over the past 2 years and think they make sense for a lot of consumers in 2022.\nIntegrated amplifiers have become very popular again with audiophiles for a few reasons and we think it\u2019s fair to say that expensive separates are becoming less relevant.\nMost integrated amplifiers being introduced today combine apower amplifier,pre-amplifier,phono section,headphone amplifier, and in some cases aDACor internal streaming capabilities.\nIt\u2019s probably more accurate to refer to amplifiers that include network connectivity; either via Wi-Fi or Ethernet as Streaming Amplifiers or Network Amplifiers. If you scroll through the features of most of these amplifiers, you\u2019ll notice that many offer support forTIDAL Connect, Spotify Connect,Roon,Qobuz, Chromecast, Apple AirPlay 2, and different Bluetooth codecs.\nWhat features should you look for when selecting a new integrated amplifier or network amplifier?\nA subwoofer outputto conveniently connect apowered subwoofer. This output may or may not include a low-pass crossover or bass management settings.\nDigital Inputssuch as USB, Optical Toslink or Coaxial enable enable connectivity to external music sources such asCD playersordigital music streamers. Such inputs mean the amplifier has an internal DAC.\nA USB inputto access digital music locally from USB stick, hard drive, laptop, tablet or computer.\nA headphone outputgenerally means the amp includes a special amplifier just for headphones, mainlyaudiophile headphoneswith high impedance requirements. Ideally it makes headphone listening sound better.\nA remote controlis usually included, but not always.\nBuild quality matters. Circuit design does too. And most importantly, equipment matching to speakers and other devices matters more than one would think.\nDo not be seduced or turned off by power ratings. Someloudspeakersonly require a few watts into an 8 ohm load, while others require an amplifier that can double its output into 4 ohms and is stable at that impedance. You are more likely to damage a loudspeaker with less power than more.\nShould you go with a tube or solid-state integrated amplifier? Tube amplifiers certainly require more hands-on maintenance and it is incorrect to state that all tube amplifiers have a \u201cwarm\u201d or \u201crich\u201d sound. Not all solid-state amplifiers are neutral sounding; we can think of more than a few that are darker or warmer sounding than some tube amplifiers.\nRemember to budget accordingly when building your stereo system. This guide should provide a great starting point for building your first stereo system or upgrading an existing one.\nWhether you\u2019re looking for a purist integrated stereo amplifier or one packed with features, we think these are some of the best to buy right now for the money.\nLearn more:A British Audiophile Review\nLearn more:See our full review\nLearn more:See our full review.\nLearn more:See our Rega IO Audiophile System Builder\nLearn more:See our full review.See Tarun\u2019s video review.\nLearn more about the Powernode.\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission.\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

A sonic Stradivarius, the craftsman, engineer, businessman and inventor holds dozens of patents for his breakthroughs, many of which he harnessed when introducing the Klipschorn loudspeaker in 1946. Known to obsessives as a corner-horn speaker, Klipschorns are built with a Klipsch-invented horn-loaded tweeter and midrange compression driver. The company\u2019s patented folded-horn 15\u2033 woofer produces low-frequencies that seem to flood the floor.\nLike many geniuses, Klipsch had an extremely organized mind but \u2013 as illustrated in the two-part documentary below \u2013 worked among a mess of scattered gear, papers, prototypes and experiments.\nIn 1991, a semi-retired Klipsch invited a videographer into the company\u2019s Hope manufacturing plant (where the company\u2019s headquarters remain) for a (very) casual tour of the facility, including Klipsch\u2019s lab and its hand-built anechoic chamber. Though it\u2019s hardly a professionally-made documentary, the video is a revelatory glimpse at how one visionary, armed only with curiosity, ambition, brains and drive, created exquisite products, the kind that not only produced magnificent sound but whose minimalist design were visually stunning.\nWatch part 1 here:\nPart 2:\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/vandersteen-1ci/",
        "content": "I know I\u2019ve been harping on \u201caffordability\u201d a lot recently oneCoustics. Boring. Yawn. I get it. But as I was watching a superb video fromCheapaudiomanthe other night at 3 a.m., I realized that there is a growing movement within the community that understands that high-end audio can\u2019t grow without a serious conversation about affordability and teaching people how to properly build a system within a budget that doesn\u2019t involve selling a kidney.\nI\u2019ve been there. On the other side. During 7 years of insanity in my mid-30s, I spent more than $70,000 on high-end audio/video equipment.\nHow much of it do I own today? Zero.\nI feel pretty stupid about it to be quite frank. I had multiple pairs of perfectly fine MartinLogan loudspeakers that I am on some fanatical quest to reclaim and start from scratch with again.\nDo you want to know why?\nBecause there was nothing wrong with them.\nNone of us hate really expensive high-end products. Some of them really push the performance envelope and that\u2019s a good thing if the technology eventually trickles down into products that are more affordable.\nBut is that really happening on the loudspeaker side?\nI see it on the digital front with better quality DACs getting more affordable; Schiit Audio, Denafrips, Helm Audio, and many others should take a bow.\nPeople getting into high-end audio for the first time do have a lot of quality affordable loudspeakers to select from in 2021, but once you get out of that category, the prices escalate rather quickly.\nHow many people jump from $500 speakers to $2,000 or $5,000 speakers?\nThe more I think about it \u2014 the more I understand the interest in used high-end and vintage components, but the flip side to all of that is that demand is pushing prices a lot higher.\nI desperately want a pair of MartinLogan Aerius i (oak finish) in great condition; but I\u2019m not going to pay a stupid price for them because I will need to replace the panels almost immediately because they were designed to only last 15 years.\nWhat about Vandersteen? I wrote about theVandersteen 1Ci speakersin my recentAudiophile System Builder columnand the feedback from a number of readers was that it was about time that someone in the audio press covered these speakers which are still in production.\nThe Vandersteen 1Ci speakers are not old enough to qualify as vintage audio (give them another 12 years and they will) but these American-made floorstanders are almost 8 years old at this point and still very much in production. The Vandersteen 1C were available back in 1996 so the earliest versions of the speaker are almost as old as the generation who probably need to listen to them the most.\nThe Vandersteen 2 (and all of its variants) loudspeakers have been in production since 1977 with more than 100,000 pairs sold; a remarkable number that very few high-end brands could ever hit with even their entire lineup.\nThe Vandersteen customer is a loyal one; most started with the Vandersteen 2 or Vandersteen 1 and have moved up the food chain over the years at great expense. The top Vandersteen loudspeakers now retail for almost $65,000.\nWhat makes the Vandersteen 1Ci so compelling is that you can find it used rather easily if you are prepared to look and you are unlikely to spend more than $900 for them even if they are in excellent condition. A brand new pair costs almost $1,700 so consider that 48% discount to be a huge bargain.\nRichard Vandersteen did some creative things with his original designs and that thought process has continued with the 1Ci that still don\u2019t have a loudspeaker cabinet; a huge cost savings for both the manufacturer and customer.\nSince its inception, Vandersteen has always focused on putting better quality woofers and tweeters and crossover components into its designs and less on the cabinet\nRichard Vandersteen has always taken a performance-first approach with the Model 1Ci focusing on the internals, with a first-order crossover, minimum front baffle, and time-aligned design.\nThe Model 1Ci is a time- and phase-correct speaker constructed in such a way that the alignment and positioning of the drivers allow a point-source wave front and maximize the phase coherence of the loudspeaker at the listening position.\nThe listening position and loudspeaker setup are critical with every Vandersteen design but the Model 1Ci benefits from very careful set-up; more than most speakers I\u2019ve tried over the years regardless of cost.\nThe active components used in the Model 1Ci combine classic strength and durability with innovative design and construction. The8-inch wooferuses the same type of cast-metal basket used in costly esoteric loudspeakers. The cast-metal basket\u2019s inherent rigidity and superior vibration resistance increase cone movement accuracy and reduce sympathetic resonances for cleaner and more natural sound.\nThe 1-inch metal alloy dome tweeter is a dual chamber design to improve range and linearity. It is critically damped to extend the high frequencies past audibility without the excessive ringing associated with open or underdamped metal dome tweeters.\nThe specific alloy used for the dome was chosen for its superior strength and resistance to break-up compared to common fabric and plastic domes. The quality materials and advanced features of the Model 1Ci\u2019s tweeter result in smooth and accurate response throughout the audible range.\nThe 1Ci no longer uses traditional banana posts but screw-down terminals instead which are directly wired to the crossover.\nThe Vandersteen 1Ci are a chunky 44 pounds and 36\u2033H x 12\u2033W x 10\u2033D; making them a rather hefty 2-way floorstanding loudspeaker on custom stands manufactured by Sound Anchors.\nSo why are we so impressed by these speakers that have dozens of competitors below $2,000 new?\nThe 1Ci are 90 dB and a relatively benign 6.8 ohm load making them a very easy loudspeaker to drive. Tubes and solid state work great with these speakers.\nCan you drive them with 35-50 watts of power? In a smaller room, you won\u2019t need any more power than that and the focus should be more on the quality of those watts versus looking for a blowtorch to open these loudspeakers up. A slightly larger room can work but 50-100 watts might be a better scenario.\nThere are some excellent vintage amplifiers that will work with these speakers but I would focus on those that can output a minimum of 35-50 watts if you lean in that direction.\nThe Vandersteen 1Ci can sound dreadful if you get the setup wrong. I\u2019ve heard them go from simple average to great with 20 minutes of proper setup.\nThe setup requires very careful attention to the distance from both the side and front walls; make sure they are never the same dimensions. The key with these speakers is getting the time-alignment right and that requires some math and experimentation with the rake. You will find very clear instructions inside the manual and my advice is to follow them because they work.\nMore than most speakers in the category, the Vandersteen 1Ci have a unwavering sense of balance. No part of its tonal balance is tilted either way and it\u2019s definitely more neutral than warm sounding.\nThe absence of a cabinet also increases the transparency and soundstage depth and width.\nWith proper setup and the right amplifier, the 1Ci can sound quite large and recreate a huge stereo image. Get the rake of the loudspeaker wrong and the midrange can sound slightly closed-in and the treble slightly harder; a warmer sounding amplifier helps tame the tweeter with rock and EDM.\nYou can certainly crank the 1Ci but I think that\u2019s a mistake; moderate to conversation levels work better and allow you to discern more detail and hear more of the amplifier and the rest of your components.\nVandersteen makes better sounding speakers but the price grows rather exponentially as you move up the ladder and you can pay over $2,000 for a used pair of Model 2Ce Signature speakers.\nVandersteenjust announced a replacement for the 1Ci called the 1Ci+which offers some internal changes. The best part about that announcement is that prices for used 1Ci loudspeakers in solid condition are dropping.\nFor more information:vandersteen.com/products/model-1ci\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission.\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/the-advent-loudspeaker/",
        "content": "Once upon a time at an estate sale in the middle of Missouri, two lucky gear hunters stumbled across a beast of a sound system that, when first acquired in the 1970s, was dense with top of the line components. Driven by a massive Pioneer SX-1250 receiver, a Thorens TD 135 turntable, and an Aiwa AD-6400 cassette deck, the system was channeled into a pair of Advent Loudspeakers. They bought the lot for $200 and divided the riches.\nAudiophiles may have read the above rundown and stumbled on the Advents. Unlike the other components, when introduced into the market in the late 1960s the speakers were so shockingly affordable that many connoisseurs passed over them on the way to pricier, more aesthetically pleasing Klipsch, JBL and Acoustic Research models.\nAdvents, however, were built by a partnership that included sound engineer Henry Kloss, who had cofounded Acoustic Research before launching Advent in 1967. Kloss and a partner had earlier been responsible for a number of innovations, most notably a unique acoustic suspension system. With Advent, Kloss\u2019s goal was to build a brilliant speaker for the masses, one that would open ears to the possibilities and glories of audiophilia and listening.\nWhoever the Missouri estate seller was, they obviously had the means to purchase any pair of speakers on the market \u2013 and stuck with the Advents. They weren\u2019t alone: vintage Advents were a hit with young buyers and across the next decade the Boston-based company sold hundreds of thousands of sets.\nFifty years later, those simply-named speakers areubiquitous on the used marketplace, where, once again, they\u2019re often passed over by collectors searching for prettier, fancier speakers. That means that budget-minded searchers can track down a pair of Advent Loudspeakers \u2013 which were renamed Larger Advents after the introduction of the Smaller Advent Loudspeaker in the early 1970s \u2013 for a few hundred dollars. Hardcore fans argue that stacking two pairs delivers sound on par with systems double the cost.\nEarlier this month audio writer Ian White penned an excellent rundown ofbest vintage audio speakers for the modern audiophile, to inform those looking for guidance on new speakers. Consider this an asterisk to his invaluable overview.\nWhich is to say, at least one rural Missouri audiophile \u2013 and their inheritor (this writer, who landed those Advents and remains a disciple to this day after owning JBLs, B&Ws and ARs) \u2013 would suggest adding Advents to the list of vintage speakers to buy."

What has given vinyl\u2019s unexpected comeback some solid legs is that new generations have discovered\u00a0the benefits of ownership; the generation that grew up on iTunes and\u00a0Spotify\u00a0finally have a physical piece of media that they can own \u2013 just like their parents and older siblings.\nLoudspeaker manufacturers have taken that newfound interest in nostalgia and reintroduced updated versions of their most popular vintage audio speakers with a great deal of success so far.\nProducts like theWharfedale Linton HeritageandKlipsch Forte IVloudspeakers are all the proof one requires.\nAll of the loudspeakers on our list have sold well; the Linton Heritage has been an enormous success for Wharfedale and for good reason.\nSupply chain issues and inflationhave also made all of them more expensive. Our prices below have been updated to reflect an increase of over 10% or more for all of them so far in 2022.\nThe Linton Heritage have jumped from$1,499 to $1,799 USDwhich is not an insignificant amount of money if you are working with a tight budget.\nTheJBL have increased by $400and the Klipsch are now $5,000 USD which is a$500increase from January.\nKLH Audiois back in the game now with the brand newKLH Model Five($2,498/pair at AmazonorCrutchfield) that has earned rave reviews from both the press and consumers. Eric Pye has his rather in-depth review forthcoming at the end of May and he\u2019s put a lot of hours through his pair.\nThe company started by Henry Kloss, Malcom Low, and Josef Anton Hofmann in 1957 sold over 30,000 pairs of loudspeakers before it was sold off in 1964; the brand had numerous owners including Kyocera who stopped manufacturing audio components in 1989.\nKLH Audio is a new company owned by Klipsch and VOXX executive, David P. Kelley. The vintage audio vibe is very strong with the Model 5 and the backlog of orders is considerable.\nVintage audiohas never been more popular; ourtwo weekly columnsdeliver consistent traffic and comments that match the response to our most popular reviews of new products.\nThe interest invintage audio loudspeakershas never been higher; especially as brands continue to refresh popular models that have been around longer than most millennials who are getting into better sound quality for the first time.\nQuality matters. Especially when there is a premium attached to ownership.\nConsumers are willing to spend a lot of money; often more than the price of a new high-end system, for really rare vintage audio components from brands like McIntosh, Mark Levinson, Krell, and Quad \u2013 so it should not surprise anyone that people are very interested in new loudspeakers from some of the oldest high-end brands that pay homage to classic designs that once occupied the front covers of every Hi-Fi magazine.\nJBL, Klipsch, and Wharfedale have been manufacturing award-winning loudspeakers for almost 73 years; all three companies entered the loudspeaker business in 1946 run by three visionaries who had spent the previous decades working on loudspeaker drivers for other audio components such as radio consoles and movie theater loudspeaker systems. It is a remarkable bit of history that all three brands not only still exist but are category leaders and some of the most popular in the world.\nAll three have survived generational changes in listening habits, format wars, advancements in amplification technology, the home theater revolution, and the shift to active and wireless loudspeakers.\nAll of these selections have an old-school aesthetic but sound nothing like their predecessors; these are modern sounding loudspeakers with advanced driver technology and certainly require quality amplifiers and sources. Green shag carpeting is optional.\nWharfedale\u2019s founder, Gilbert Briggs built his first loudspeaker in 1932 in his home in Ilkey, Yorkshire; the town was based in the valley of the river \u201cWharfe.\u201d Briggs opened Wharfedale Wireless Works in 1933 supplying advanced loudspeaker drivers to the growing radio industry and the company became a leading supplier selling more than 9,000 units per year until the outbreak of World War II. The company flourished after the war and became one of the first companies to offer a two-way loudspeaker in 1945 \u2013 the prototype for the modern loudspeaker.\nWharfedale introduced the original Linton in 1965 and the model which utilized three drive units developed a strong following with its smooth midrange, punchy low end, and sense of scale. The model disappeared from their line-up in the 1970s but was recently reintroduced as the stand-mounted Linton Heritage. Wharfedale has also designed a custom stand for the Linton Heritage that puts the tweeter around 36\u201d from the floor and includes room for records as well.\nThe three-way loudspeakers are larger than mostbookshelf loudspeakersmaking the stands a logical accessory to maximize their performance. The modern Linton feature an 8-inch Kevlar cone woofer, 5-inch Kevlar cone midrange driver, and 1-inch soft dome tweeter. Listeners may decide to ditch the woven grille covers, but we think they give the Linton that old-school look that makes them stand out.\nWharfedale designed the Linton with two rear ports which requires giving these loudspeakers some distance from the wall behind them; the 8-inch woofer can deliver the goods playing Led Zeppelin with only 20 watts so don\u2019t confuse old with polite. The Linton Heritage offer all of the midrange resolution and natural sound of the original, but with a lot more detail, speed, and transparency.\nThey deliver scale and image rather well considering their boxy looking cabinet. If your budget can stretch to $1,500 which includes the stands, the Linton should be on your short list.\nThe Linton Heritage can work well with a lot of different amplifiers; Audiolab, Cambridge Audio, Naim, Croft Acoustics, Creek, and vintage amplifiers from Marantz, Audio Research, and Sansui are all solid options.\nFind your local dealer:https://www.wharfedale.co.uk/global-distributor/\nJames Bullough Lansing founded JBL in 1946, after the death of his partner, Ken Decker, with whom he had spent twenty years developing successful speaker drivers and movie theater sound systems under the Lansing Manufacturing Company brand name. Decker had been responsible for the business end of Lansing and his demise sent the company into a financial tailspin until it was acquired and renamed as Altec Lansing in 1941.\nBoth companies went their separate ways and Lansing introduced several innovative Alnico drivers that became signature JBL products over the decades. Lansing died in 1949, but the company pushed forward under the guidance of JBL\u2019s vice-president, Bill Thomas. JBL was eventually acquired by Sidney Harman who turned the brand into the world leader in pro audio, movie theater loudspeakers, and high-end systems that exists today.\nJBL introduced the original L-100 Century in 1970 and they soon became one of the best-selling loudspeakers of all-time. Priced at $250 each, The L-100 Century were derived from JBL\u2019s 4310 studio monitors and the home version were fussy beasts that needed space and a lot of power.\nThe L-100 were detailed and dynamic sounding loudspeakers that worked well with classic rock but were not the last word in refinement. Their trademark orange, blue, or black foam grille covers are still coveted by collectors today.\nJBL re-introduced the L-100 Classic in 2018and after the sticker shock wore off, audiophiles discovered that decades of driver innovation at JBL were something to appreciate in the new design.\nThe L-100 Classic utilize JBL\u2019s pure-pulp cone five-inch midrange drivers, 12-inch bass driver, and 1-inch Titanium dome tweeter in a stand-mounted loudspeaker that deliver all of the accuracy of the world\u2019s best studio monitors, but with a lot more finesse and a warmer tone than the original.\nThe L-100 Classic still require a lot of space and a powerful amplifier, but they fill a large room with ease and are one of the most dynamic sounding loudspeakers available for the price. If you crave an intense listening experience, the JBL are well worth an audition.\nFind your local dealer:https://www.jbl.com/specialty-audio-dealer-locator.html\nThere are few American loudspeaker brands as iconic as Klipsch. Founded by the late-Paul W. Klipsch in 1946 in a tiny shed in Hope, Arkansas, Klipsch has remained true to its founder\u2019s ideals for more than seven decades. Paul Klipsch developedthe legendaryKlipschornwith the premise of recreating the sound of live music in the home.\nThe corner horn Klipschorn have been in production for over 70 years and still deliver on Klipsch\u2019s four key design elements: high-efficiency/low distortion, controlled directivity, wide-dynamic range, and flat-frequency response.\nPaul Klipsch designed loudspeakers that were easy to drive, directed sound directly towards the listener in an attempt to minimize the room\u2019s impact on soundstage depth and width, could reproduce both the quietest and loudest sounds with both clarity and free of distortion, and sounded as transparent and uncolored as possible across the entire frequency spectrum.\nThe Klipsch \u201csound\u201d has remained true to Paul\u2019s technical goals but the boldness of the presentation hasn\u2019t always been for everyone. The physical size of the Klipschorn doesn\u2019t make them practical for most rooms, but the Heritage Forte IV loudspeakers are one of the most engaging loudspeakers available and the updated version are much easier to use in most listening spaces \u2013 with a few caveats.\nThe Forte was introduced in 1985, but there is considerable daylight between the original and the latest version that still looks like something your father had in his living room in the 1970s. The Forte IV are large, heavy, and unlikely to impress initially with their dated look.\nAll of that changes the moment you drive the super-efficientForte IVwith 10-15 watts of tube power and put some distance between the loudspeaker and your listening position. Music pours out of the Forte IV\u2019s drivers and smacks you in the face; in a good way that becomes more natural sounding once you get over the shock. This refreshed vintage audio speaker sounds much more dynamic than a lot of other new designs.\nUnlike other Klipsch models which can sound bright and forward sounding, the Forte IV sound more restrained without sacrificing the tone, dynamics, and sense of realism that they deliver. All genres of music work with the Forte IV and with warmer sounding amplifiers and sources, they make a lot of really super expensive audiophile loudspeakers sound rather lifeless.\nFind your local dealer:https://www.klipsch.com/products/forte-iv-floorstanding-speaker#buy-now\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission.\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "title": "The Budget Audiophiler: Fisher 400 Tube Receiver",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/budget-audiophiler-fisher-400/",
        "content": "The Budget Audiophiler is going to begin this week with a little rant. I need to vent aboutMcIntosh. The folks in Binghamton have my utmost respect, but they have created a problem that they can\u2019t fix. I\u2019m laying my obsessive love for tube amplifiers at their feet. I remember the first time I saw aMcIntosh MC240 stereo tube amplifierand just getting lost in the moment; almost becoming transfixed by the industrial piece of art and its illuminated exposed tubes.\nAt some point, I will own a McIntosh tube amplifier, but the cult surrounding these gorgeous vintage pieces has pushed the prices well out of reach. I\u2019m a practical person. I have a normal day job like everyone else, kids, mortgage payments, and I did what any other sane person in my position would do \u2013 I sold one of my organs as a down payment on that amplifier. Just kidding. Instead of obsessing in the short-term, I began conducting research and one amplifier began showing up in almost all of my searches; the Fisher 400.\nAnd so begins our little journey.\nI\u2019m a hunter. Not like Steve McQueen in his last film with the cool car chase in the tower in Chicago that ends rather violently in the river below \u2013 but a hunter of vintage audio. I hunt for audio bargains online and can smell one when I find it. The more I read about the Fisher 400 tube receiver, the more I realized that I might have discovered something wonderful that I never knew that I wanted. Finding a bargain in this scenario was most likely not going to pan out, but I was going to try.\nGrowing up in the 1980s, I remember Fisher as a manufacturer of mid-fi (I\u2019m being polite) receivers and stereo systems. Sanyo had purchased the company and brand name in 1975 (from Emerson who bought the brand in 1969) and nothing was ever the same. The products produced in the 1960s and 1980s are miles part; both in terms of sound quality, and the level of industrial design. The original Fisher products were gorgeous and designed for people who cared about sound quality.\nThe clarity from this amplifier manufactured almost 6 decades ago was startling. The detail, transparency, and level of engagement was superb.\nAvery Fisher started the Fisher Radio Corporation in 1945, and in the 1960s they focused on high-end tube audio components, consoles, and phonographs. The models that caught my eye were the 400, 500, and 800 (and their variants). Fisher was actually the first manufacturer to offer audio separates; McIntosh, Marantz, H.H. Scott, and Harmon Kardon would eventually do the same. \u201cThe Fisher\u201d was the actual brand name that was marketed.\nFisher\u2019s first receiver was the model 500, a mono AM/FM receiver using two\u00a0EL37\u00a0output tubes. It had a brass-plated face panel and an optional mahogany or \u201cblonde\u201d wooden case.\nAll three had different features and power ratings, but they were all tube receivers or integrated amplifiers. I set out to find one of these models, but I was seduced by the iconic \u201cbird\u201d icon featured on the 400 and 800 model receivers. The more I hunted for one of these tube receivers \u2013 the more I found myself drawn to all of the marketing material and catalogs that the brand produced.\nThey knew back then what a lot of modern brands forget \u2013 this is about lifestyle.\nAt the beginning of my journey two years ago, I was definitely in a learning phase in regard to tube technology. I had not yet learned how to solder and the last time I used a multi-meter, I set a small fire in my house. My wife wasn\u2019t so happy with the Budget Audiophiler that weekend.\nWith my pride slightly wounded, I had the intelligence to focus on finding a \u201cserviced\u201d model. That term means very different things to a lot of people. When looking for any kind of vintage component you really need to ask a lot of questions. There are no stupid questions when it pertains to plugging a 60 year-old piece of electrical equipment into a power receptacle.\nAt the very bottom of the list is the seller who claims that the unit is \u201cserviced\u201d but is unable or unwilling to provide you with the information to determine If that is true. You should avoid this type of transaction. Been there. Done that. Not a good result.\nAnother seller might claim that the unit is \u201cpartially serviced\u201d; which means that the unit has been tested and specific components that were out of spec or broken have been replaced. I would ask specific questions about which components were replaced, the timing of those repairs, and who performed them.\nAny seller who gets weird when you ask these questions should be a red flag.\nDemand exceeds supply in this particular case so expect to pay in the range of $400 \u2013 $1,400 for the Fisher 400 tube receiver.\nThe final seller might claim in their advertisement that the unit has undergone a \u201cfull restoration.\u201d The same comprehensive list of questions from #2 seller have to be applied here as well. I would also want to know which tubes (new or NOS) are being included in the transaction. Are they new or the from the original tube set?\nYou want a seller who knows the product and understands the nature of the changes that were made. If the \u201cfully restored\u201d unit is selling for an amount that seems too low (do your research), you might not be getting the full story.\nAfter a few near hits and a month of comprehensive searches, I found an excellent version of The Fisher 400 and bid. I was not successful at winning this specific model, but I did discover the type of seller that you want to work with. \u201cFrank\u201d (whom I found on eBay) was very open about all of the changes and modifications that he made to the models that he had for sale.\nWhat made him unique was that he focused specifically on Fisher components from the 1960s and was able to provide very detailed photographs and videos about each component. He was the type of seller who was methodical about the restorations performed. He only sourced the best possible examples of each model and had the entire component restored internally; brand new capacitors, new tubes (if required), new wiring, and with or without the refinished wood case.\nAfter building up some trust, he informed me that he had one of the \u201cbest\u201d model Fisher 400s coming in with the original \u201c65 watts\u201d sticker attached to the front panel. I decided to bite. We agreed to a fair price and I was elated.\nThe prices for vintage components like the Fisher 400 are rising. Substantially. Collectors know that there are a finite number of these prized components available, and that people are willing to spend to own one.\nTwo very long weeks passed before I received confirmation that the unit was ready. I made the decision to not purchase the restored wood case because it reduced the price by a few hundred dollars. I suspected that I would be able to find one at a later date and what kind of Heathen would want to cover up so many beautiful glowing tubes.\nThe seller also made a point of providing me with test results from the unit before it was shipped.\nWhen I received notification from FedEx that the unit could be picked up, I rushed out to get a case of my favourite cold nourishment, and drove home with a stupid grin on my face. The Crate & Barrel shipping box was a nice touch.\nThe Fisher 400 tube receiver that I purchased uses Electro Harmonix 7868 output tubes; the 65 watts of output make the receiver far more useful with more modern loudspeakers and its sound quality impresses me more and more with each new loudspeaker that I try with it.\nThe first night with the Fisher 400 was one of experimentation. I paired the receiver with Ohm 3X0s, Jensen Model 4s, EPI Time/Energy, and my prized Ohm Walsh F loudspeakers. All of them sounded amazing but I ended up keeping it paired with the Ohm Walsh 3X0.\nThe clarity from this amplifier manufactured almost 6 decades ago was startling. The detail, transparency, and level of engagement was superb.\nI have since added a case and some right-angle spade forks so that I can use loudspeaker cables terminated with banana pins. Not a huge amount of money and far preferable to bare wire.\nMy experience taught me that there are some reputable sellers out there and if you do your homework, there is a great chance of finding a solid example of this amplifier or one of the other models from the 500 or 800 series of amplifiers.\nAs I mentioned, demand exceeds supply in this particular case so expect to pay in the range of $400 \u2013 $1,400 for the Fisher 400 tube receiver.\nIf you can find one inside a console at an estate or garage sale, I can provide you with some guidance on getting it repaired or restored \u2014 and help you find a case.\nThe Fisher 400 is one of my greatest finds and will be part of our home for many years to come.\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission."

        "title": "Should you buy the Klipsch RP-600M bookshelf speakers?",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/klipsch-rp-600m/",
        "content": "A lot of ink has been spilt about the Klipsch RP-600M; I rather enjoyed my time with them but I also have firsthand experience with them driven by a lot of amplifiers and have been exposed to their limitations and warts over a much longer period of time.\nMost consumers will order them online without even an audition and that\u2019s often a recipe for disappointment if the rest of the system isn\u2019t a good match.\nI had the chance to listen to them again recently with another batch of amplifiers and I still stand by my original review; you learn something new every time you switch out an amplifier or source.\nOver the past year, I\u2019ve watched a number of YouTube videos where reviewers and even manufacturers of other loudspeakers have taken these loudspeakers apart to explain their limitations and also point out areas where they can be improved.\nI don\u2019t have an issue with the DIY crowd making \u201cimprovements\u201d to their samples but let\u2019s be honest \u2014 99% of the people buying these speakers are not taking them apart and I\u2019m pretty sure that most would screw them up somehow if they tried.\nUnless you know what you are doing \u2014 don\u2019t take apart your loudspeakers and get upset when they don\u2019t sound any different (or worse) based on what someone told you in a video.\nBack to Klipsch.\nKlipsch have been in business more than 70 years but the past 5 years must feel like some serious vindication for them. I\u2019m not going to burst that balloon because they deserve their current success; and all of the bootlicking coming from the high-end press.\nTake a bowKlipsch Audio RP-600M.\nBootlicking? An endless supply and it must feel rather sweet going down \u2013 like some of that fine Kentucky Bourbon.\nThe RP-600M are not even part of their vaunted \u201cHeritage\u201d Series but I\u2019m 100% certain that Klipsch would sell out of a Heritage RP-600M model if it were ever introduced. I would buy the first pair.\nFor years, the high-end press told audiophiles that Klipsch were for home theater customers; that no serious music listener should consider them.\nTwo of our columnists usevintage Klipsch loudspeakersat home and I trust their ability to discern excellent sound quality. Klipsch never stopped making great loudspeakers. The audiophile press just found other brands to promote.\nThe Klipsch RP-600M loudspeakers ($769.00/pair) benefit from some trickle down technology borrowed from its more expensive siblings in the Heritage line-up, and it\u2019s ironic that audiophiles who swore for the past few decades that they would never be caught dead with a pair of Klipsch are lining up to buy them now. Apparently, there is something to the Klipsch sound that people really like.\nAt their asking price, the RP-600M are not without some level of compromise; using the wrong amplifier and not paying attention to set-up affects their performance just enough to make them an exciting listen at first, but not very fulfilling over the long haul. Getting things right with the Klipsch RP-600M from the very beginning will change how you perceive your music collection for many years to come.\nMusic has a presence that few loudspeakers priced below $1,000 can really match; competing products from Quad, Wharfedale, Polk Audio, PSB, KEF, and Paradigm all do a very fine job with all kinds of music, and offer a well-rounded presentation \u2013 but they don\u2019t have the swagger of the RP-600M. Some might find the RP-600M to be too much of a good thing, but they are probably using the wrong amplifier if that\u2019s the case.\nKlipsch loudspeakers have a reputation for being forward/bright sounding, and while there is certainly a lot of top end energy and detail emanating out of the RP-600M\u2019s 1-inch titanium-dome tweeter with hybrid cross-section Tractrix horn, the loudspeaker never really crosses that line. If anything, the RP-600M are the most laid-back sounding pair of Klipsch loudspeakers that I have heard over the past 25 years.\nHorns, in particular, have a healthy degree of bite and tone making them a vibrant listen with great jazz recordings like Hank Mobley\u2019sWorkout(Tidal/MQA) and Donald\u2019s ByrdA New Perspective (Tidal/16-bit/44.1 kHz). Byrd\u2019s signature track \u201cCristo Redentor\u201d had me a little nervous leading up to the moment where his trumpet enters, but the combination of the RP-600M along with a number of warmer sounding amplifiers from Schiit Audio, Heed, Cambridge Audio, and AmpsandSound retained all of the magic without a loss of detail.\nThe RP-600M\u2019s 6.5-inch Cerametallic cone woofer does an admirable job with vocals but nobody will ever confuse it for a paper or polypropylene driver; there was a slight hardness on some recordings like Sam Cooke\u2019sNight Beat(Tidal/16-bit/44.1 kHz) that I have never heard when playing tracks like \u201cLost and Lookin\u2019\u201d though the Quad S-2, PSB Alpha P5, or Wharfedale Diamond 10.1s.\nSwitching over to my vinyl copy of the aforementioned album, there was less of an edge in the upper midrange compared to the same tracks when streaming via Tidal, but it\u2019s clear that the Klipsch sacrifice some midrange warmth for a sharper edge, and more immediate sounding presentation. It\u2019s not a bad thing if you can balance it out with an amplifier or sources that dial back the RP-600M\u2019s exuberance \u2013 but it\u2019s clearly there.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a bass heavy two-way loudspeaker, the Klipsch RP-600M get you part of the way there \u2013 but not completely. Having spent time recently with the Forte III, and La Scala II, I\u2019ve noticed a bit of a trend with Klipsch loudspeakers and bass response. If you\u2019re looking for subterranean bass response that will rattle your walls, the RP-600M are going to leave you hanging somewhat; what you get instead is quick, tuneful bass that is somewhat on the lean side depending on your choice of amplifier.\nListening to Aphex Twin\u2019s \u201cTo Cure a Weakling Child\u201d (Tidal, 16-bit/44.1 kHz) made it pretty clear that the RP-600M are very adept with electronica; the track energized my 16 x 13 x 9 den with relatively tight bass that was fairly extended, but there is no question that it could have benefitted from a subwoofer.\nIf you can pull them 2-3\u2019 from the front wall, they do a reasonable job recreating the space between you and the musicians, but there is trade-off in tonal balance and bass response. Because they are rear ported, I left them 26\u201d from the wall and that proved to be a good compromise in my listening space; the RP-600M sounded fuller to my ears pointed straight ahead and 72\u201d apart.\nAnother positive was their overall appearance, which earned a lot of positive comments from both family and friends who walked past them during the review process. Most people didn\u2019t believe the price and were not turned off by their size (15.7\u201d H by 8\u2033 W by 11.9\u2033 D). The magnetically attached grill covers reduce the overall output by 1dB and there is no question that they impart a tiny veil over the sound. The RP-600M do require robust loudspeaker stands if you really want to pull every last bit of performance out of them.\nThe RP-600M are efficient, high-sensitivity loudspeakers but Klipsch\u2019s claim of 96dB/W/m is not something that I was able to verify. Every amplifier will make the RP-600M sound different; low-powered tube amplifiers carved out the best sound, but 25-50 watts from the right amplifier will be more than you ever need.\nThe RP-600 are above average in the imaging department, but don\u2019t expect them to reproduce a palpable, three-dimensional soundstage in your room.\nThere is a slight level of hardness in the upper midrange that may bother some people with vocals depending on your amplifier. If you stick with warmer sounding amplifiers or sources, the issue will probably never rear its ugly head; and you\u2019ll think they have unbelievable presence.\nAt $769, the Klipsch RP-600M are capable of over-achieving with the right electronics. Drive them with a cheap receiver, or even expensive analytical sounding amplifier and you will find very little joy with them.\nConnecting them to something like the Schiit Audio Aegir or Ragnarok 2,Heed Elixir,or any robust sounding EL34/EL84 tube amplifier will be a match in sonic heaven and end the argument that inexpensive loudspeakers can\u2019t move you emotionally. A future classic.\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "title": "Nine Affordable Phono Cartridges to Upgrade Your Sound",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/nine-affordable-phono-cartridges/",
        "content": "Vinyl finds itself at an unexpected crossroads in 2022; a new generation of listeners has turned the format into a billion dollar industry again and there are not enough phono cartridges in stock to satisfy global demand. Streaming might be 85% of the market but phono cartridges are one of the hottest categories right now and that caught some with their pants down. Our picks for best affordable phono cartridges are all proven winners and compatible with a wide range of tonearms.\nAmericans bought a lot of new records in 2021.41.7 millionLPs according to the folks at MRC Data. That\u2019s an increase of 51.4% year over year and the first time vinyl records have outsold CDs since 1991. Phono cartridge manufacturers are struggling to keep up with demand.\nIf you are in the market for anaffordable audiophile turntable, or replacement cartridge, it\u2019s easy to get lost looking through the hundreds of affordable phono cartridges that are available. Deciding if you want a moving coil or moving magnet (or moving iron if select one from Grado Labs) cartridge is just one part of the decision making process.\nCompatibility with the tonearm is also something that you need to pay attention to; just because you want to mount a specific cartridge on yourturntabledoesn\u2019t mean that you should without checking with the manufacturer or dealer for advice.\nMany entry-level turntables come with a pre-installed cartridge from Audio-Technica, Grado Labs, Sumiko, or Ortofon. Aside from confirming the tracking weight and that the anti-skate is properly set, you\u2019re usually only a few minutes from listening to records in this scenario.\nBut if you\u2019re looking to upgrade what you already own or don\u2019t love the sound from the pre-installed cartridge on your new table, these are very worthy alternatives and excellent value for the money.\nBut if you want to elevate the level of playback quality from your records, there are a number of options below $750 that extract a lot more information from the grooves and help shape the tonal presentation of the music.\nYour choice ofphono pre-amplifierwill also impact the overall sound quality in a significant way.\nDo not spend more on the cartridge than the table. A better turntable with the right arm will maximize sound quality with even an inexpensive moving magnet cartridge like a Nagaoka MP-110 \u2013 versus a $750 Dynavector on an entry-level turntable.\nProper set-up of your cartridge is more important than what you spend. Clean your records and your stylus. Nothing ruins a stylus faster than dirty records.\nJapanese manufacturer, Nagaoka, has been manufacturing outstanding moving magnet phono cartridges for almost 70 years. The entry-level MP-110 is an excellent tracker digging into worn out grooves with authority and delivers a very open and detailed sounding presentation across the entire frequency spectrum. The 5mV output is on the high side, but that also makes it compatible with a wide range of phono pre-amplifiers.\nThe cartridge is a good match on both entry-level and more expensive turntables and offers a lot of performance in a Rega, Pro-Ject, or SME tonearm for under $130. It may not be as popular as the 2M Red from Ortofon which shows up pre-installed on a lot of entry-level tables, but it offers a smoother ride and with less top end bite.\nFor more information:www.nagaoka.eu\nWhere to buy:$145 at Amazon|Turntable Lab\nLooking through their extensive lineup of phono cartridges can be somewhat confusing, but Audio-Technica have some really affordable cartridges below $200 that really shine on a better table. Install on something entry-level, and the sound will be fine but nothing really special considering how much potential lurks inside the cartridge body. But which one should you buy and do they really sound all that different? Not only do they sound different, but the type and shape of the stylus will have a huge impact on the sound. Even at this price level.\nThe AT-VM95ML is a moving magnet cartridge with a microlinear stylus and rather quiet in the grooves. The 3.5mV output makes it compatible with most internal phono preamps that you\u2019ll find in your receiver or integrated amplifier, and it has excellent channel separation. It\u2019s not the warmest cartridge that we\u2019ve ever heard so pair it with a warm sounding phono preamp or amplifier. Detail freaks will love this cart. Bass freaks will find it somewhat lean and quick sounding in the lower registers. It\u2019s a clean sounding cart that has a little more emphasis in the treble than the Sumiko Moonstone.\nFor more information:www.audio-technica.com/en-us/at-vm95ml\nWhere to buy:$169 at Amazon|Turntable Lab\nSome cartridges fly under the radar because the brand doesn\u2019t get them into the hands of enough members of the press or because the price doesn\u2019t create enough buzz in comparison to rivals. Goldring have been in business almost as long as Danish rival, Ortofon, and that puts them in rather elite company.\nThe Goldring E Series are natural rivals to anything Audio-Technica and Ortofon have to offer below $180 and the E3 might best them all. I\u2019ve been listening for the past two weeks (the E3 replaced both the Ortofon 2M Red on my NAD table) and it\u2019s not even close.\nThe E3 has an aluminum cantilever with an elliptical tip (0.3 x 0.7mil) while the base E1 model swaps the aluminum for carbon reinforced ABS and the tip for a 0.6mil spherical design.\nThe E3 is impressively clean sounding at the price, with excellent pace and just enough top end energy to keep things interesting. Unlike the 2M Red that can sound quite etched at the top, the Goldring E3 is far more balanced sounding and demonstrates better control within the grooves. This is an affordable MM cartridge that sounds quite poised with all genres of music and one that has permanently replaced the Ortofon 2M Red on my table.\nRead our full reviewof the Goldring E3 MM Phono Cartridge.\nFor more information:goldring.co.uk/goldring-e3.html\nWhere to buy:$169 at Amazon\nDenon introduced theDL-103in 1962 for professional broadcast use, and it has proven to be of the most popular and reliable phono cartridges of its kind. The low output moving coil design (0.3mV) requires a higher mass tonearm; opening the door to used Fidelity Research, SME, or EMT arms or more expensive modern arms from Kuzma, or Jelco (which recently decided to cease production). Jazz listeners have long prized the DL-103\u2019s tonal balance and open presentation that make both brass instruments and vocals come alive.\nThe DL-103 requires at least 60dB of gain to come alive; sticking a step-up transformer between the affordable DL-103 and the moving magnet input of your phono stage can be a transformative experience when everything is set-up correctly. Third party manufacturers have been offering modified DL-103 variants for the past few years at considerable expense, but our advice would be to stick with the stock model from Denon.\nFor more information:denon.com/en-us/product/turntables/dl-103\nWhere to buy:$349 at Amazon|Turntable Lab|Denon.com\nSumiko offers an extensive lineup of both moving coil and moving magnet cartridges; a number of models come pre-installed on Pro-Ject tables being distributed in North America and there is a lot to like about the Moonstone at under $300. This 3mV moving magnet cartridge is in the middle of the range and possibly the smoothest sounding of the bunch. The Moonstone has excellent channel separation and tracks exceptionally well.\nHow does it compare to the other cartridges in this survey? It\u2019s certainly smoother sounding than the Audio-Technica, but that comes at the expense of some detail in the treble and it doesn\u2019t create a huge soundstage like the Dynavector or Hana. Out of the box, it\u2019s a tad polite but that changes for the better after about 20-30 hours of use. Clarity, refinement, and a punchy low-end describes the Moonstone rather well. Do not use this cart with overly warm sounding phono preamps \u2014 way too much of a good thing.\nFor more information:sumikophonocartridges.com/product/moonstone-mm-phono-cartridge/\nWhere to buy:$299 at Amazon|Turntable Lab\nHana\u2019s parent company has been an OEM manufacturer for a number of prestigious Japanese phono cartridge brands for years, but the decision to enter the marketplace with their own cartridges under the \u201cHana\u201d label has been a huge success so far. Hana offers three tiers of phono cartridges; creating some welcome competition for Ortofon, Grado, and Audio-Technica, and it is the low-output EL (0.5mV) utilizing an elliptical stylus that shines the brightest with a quality moving coil phono pre-amplifier.\nAn excellent tracker, the EL offers a lush sounding midrange, and slightly rolled-off treble making it an excellent cartridge with a wide range of music and systems. Partnered with a phono pre-amplifier from iFi Audio or Moon by SimAudio, the Hana EL can deliver a lot of performance for only $475.\nFor more information:musicalsurroundings.com/products/hana-el-mc-cartridge\nWhere to buy:$475 at Amazon|Turntable Lab\nA century of cartridge development expertise and manufacturing has to count for something so it\u2019s not surprising to see at least one cartridge from the Danish manufacturer on our list. Ortofon offers a wide range of cartridges from under $100 to almost $10,500 for the Anna MC cartridge, but our favorite affordable model from their line-up is the 2M Bronze. The 2M Red comes pre-installed on a lot of entry-level turntables but we think the additional $375 is well worth it for a lot of reasons. The 5mV output makes it compatible with almost every available external phono pre-amplifier and integrated amplifier, and it\u2019s extremely easy to install \u2013 although those who are thinking about installing it on a Rega tonearm will require spacers to achieve the correct set-up height.\nThe 2M Bronze delivers tonal accuracy, pace, and a boldness that love with tube pre-amplifiers or warming sounding systems. Imaging is excellent, and the top end is far smoother sounding than the 2M Red. We\u2019ve long believed that a better table is more important than spending a fortune on a cartridge and the 2M Bronze is a decided overachiever on expensive turntables. You may listen and decide that your records have never sounded any better.\nFor more information:www.ortofon.com/ortofon-2m-bronze-p-325-n-1579\nWhere to buy:$419 at Audio Advice|Amazon|Turntable Lab\nGrado Labs has been designing and manufacturing its award-winning moving iron cartridges in the same Brooklyn facility for more than 40 years, and this family-owned business rarely changes its designs unless the improvements are going to be significant. The Timbre Series Sonata3 moving iron cartridge housed in an Australian Jarrah wood chassis may be one the best from the venerable brand for under $600.\nThe 4.0mV output makes it compatible with a wide range of phono pre-amplifiers and it\u2019s almost impossible to not pick-up on the Grado house sound; extended dynamics, low end punch, and a warm tonal balance that is highly addictive. The new Timbre models are quieter than the previous models with improved levels of detail. The wood body Grado cartridges sound particularly robust on VPI and Clearaudio turntables.\nFor more information:gradolabs.com/cartridges/timbre-series/item/121-sonata3\nWhere to buy:$600 at 4OurEars(Official Grado Store)\nDynavector has offered this high output moving coil cartridge (2.5mV) for more than 20 years, and while not inexpensive, the 10\u00d75 Mk2 may be the best overall cartridge of its kind with superb tracking, a balanced presentation, and excellent dynamics making it a great choice for jazz listeners. Installation used to be a tad cumbersome, but that issue has been resolved with some minor changes to the headshell.\nThe 10\u00d75 Mk2 may not be the \u201cbest\u201d at anything, but it has earned its reputation as a workhorse cartridge that manages to survive expensive table and tonearm upgrades. Vocals and brass have impressive presence, and there is a synergy between the 10\u00d75 Mk2 and tube phono pre-amplifiers that makes it a final destination for many.\nFor more information:www.dynavector.com/products/cart/e_10x5mk2.html\nWhere to buy:$750 at MusicDirect\nRelated reading:Best Budget Phono Cartridges Below $300\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission."

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/emt-927-the-holy-grail-of-broadcast-turntables/",
        "content": "Massive, industrial, monochromatic, and most of all outright intimidating, the EMT 927 doesn\u2019t look like most coveted vintage hi-fi turntables. Entirely stripped of the delicate wood finishes and sleek design efforts that often define quality gear, the 927 seems built to withstand a firefight, with a tank-like appearance cast straight out of a prewar industrial Germany.\nAesthetics, however, were far from the developers\u2019 intentions. Quite literally built to be indestructible, the 927\u2019s were designed in cooperation with the \u2018Rundfunktechnisches Institut\u2019 (Broadcasting Technique Institute) directed by Walter Kuhl. With Kuhl at the helm, the EMT team set out to create a \u2018large studio turntable\u2019 that could be used 24/7/365 in a professional radio broadcast setting.\nThe need for it to blend with home furnishing with striking design \u2013 or even look merely presentable \u2013 wasn\u2019t in its DNA. Seventy years later Kuhl would be stunned to discover that this turntable now nests primarily as the center fixture of some of the best home systems and is one of the most desirable vintage HiFi tables on the market.\nAgain, quality, not appearance: These were the principles upon which Elektromesstechnik was founded. Created in 1938 by Wilhelm Franz in Berlin, EMT was established with a sole purpose: to produce elite and affordable broadcast technology. And from 1951 to the late \u201980s, just before they embraced the digital playback era, the company produced what is considered the most outstanding 16-inch turntable ever built. Their first born was this, the monolithic 927.\nSitting in an all-aluminum skeletal chassis, the 927 measures at a whopping 67.5 x 52 x 21.5 cm and weighs the same as a baby rhino (approximately 80-plus pounds). Above its exposed innards is a hefty and absurdly oversized 44 cm platter (roughly 17 inches). At the time, a 16-inch turntable was necessary for broadcasting stations of the 1930s through the 1950s to play 16-inch transcription discs, mainly containing soap operas that were a mainstay of the world-leading radio networks.\nNext to the platter sits a 12\u201d Ortofon (or EMT) tonearm, all resting on a hammer-tone face that\u2019s\u00a0 fitted with military-grade switches, levers, knobs, and a lifter so smooth you can feel the movement. The platter sits on a ridiculous ball bearing with a shaft that\u2019s 16.6 cm long and has a diameter of 2 cm (!). The most significant component in the assembly is, of course, its motor. On paper it seems more suited for some kind of engine than a turntable. It comes in either 50 hertz or 60 hertz, measuring 13.5 cm in diameter and 20 cm long.\nA precision manufactured three-step pulley is mounted on the motor axis, and a precision idler transfers the power from the motor to the inside rim of the platter. The 927\u2019s idler drive is so detailed that it\u2019s said to guarantee the most competent bass and ensure that the music keeps its most accurate pace, a quality most frequently mentioned when compared to Gerarrd turntables. Many say that because of this, the music being played, with all of its variables and instruments, is recreated in its complete totality and flows the most effortlessly forward.Its unique motor brake also allows for fine adjustment of the speed, about +/-10% adjustment. It can, literally, dead-stop a record playing at 78 rpm (!).\nEMT followed up the 927 with the 930, which has just a little less of everything \u2013 a more economical turntable developed to reach more stations and studios.\nSoundwise, it\u2019s tough to express the superlative ability of this complex machine. Like with all playback, it can never fully reproduce source music; it will always be a reproduction, slightly altered, a shadow version of the original sounds. However, this is where the 927 exceeds that expectation. Due to its robust, muscular, and legendary build quality, it produces a sound that\u2019s\u00a0 precise, immense, and effortless. These uncommonly large puzzle pieces come together to create an unmatched stability that lends itself to a more authoritative and authentic sound presentation.\nThis, in essence, is why so many HiFi forums have subject lines that ask why no other turntable beats the EMT 927. It\u2019s also commonly listed atop answers to the question, \u201cWhat is the best turntable ever?\u201dTo hear it is to believe it. But, unfortunately, as with all great gear, getting your hands on one will make too deep a dent in anyone\u2019s savings. But keep your fingers crossed at the next showroom (like we are).Until then, here is a video that will paint a miniature musical portrait of this holy grail machine."

        "content": "Most people love the idea of a pair of floor standing loudspeakers in their living room or den, but domestic concerns often put a serious dent in that plan. There\u2019s also the issue of cost; consumers don\u2019t necessarily want to spend thousands of dollars on speakers and the truth is that the quality of bookshelf or stand-mounted loudspeakers in 2021 has never been better.\nThe idea that you have to accept mediocre sound quality if you can only afford to spend $500 for a pair of speakers is completely false. Let\u2019s put that nonsense to bed.\nGetting more for less now means that you can spend more on a better amplifier or network streamer or turntable to go along with your new loudspeakers. Building a great sounding hi-fi system on a budget below $3,000 is actually the new normal and don\u2019t let anyone shame you into thinking you\u2019re not an audiophile if that\u2019s where you need to start.\nNever judge a pair of speakers by its grille covers or its price. The Paradigm Monitor SE Atom will not impress with their boxy and somewhat austere appearance \u2013 and that\u2019s exactly why you need to give these overachieving two-way bookshelf loudspeakers a serious listen. Where the rubber meets the road with these loudspeakers is when you remove the grille covers and discover that Paradigm is spoiling you with a scaled-down version of their X-Pal perforated phase-aligned tweeter and a robust 5 \u00bd\u201d mid-bass driver that belongs on loudspeakers that are double the price. The Monitor SE Atom are relatively easy to drive but take a significant step forward if you reward them with power. Tubes or warm sounding solid-state is the way to go if you want to hear what these loudspeakers can do.$318/pair at Amazon.\nThe updated 3030i is larger than its predecessor, featuring a new crossover, reinforced internal bracing, as well as recessed binding posts for those who may want to wall-mount or set-up close to the wall. Q Acoustics have gone the extra mile with the finish options as well; the English Walnut, Graphite Grey and Arctic White give the 3030i a modern look that belies its price. The 3030i are not particularly difficult to drive but they benefit from some power; its 6.5\u201d mid/bass driver is capable of excellent bass extension with the right amplifier. The 1\u201d soft-dome tweeter (taken from the more expensive 3050i) balances out the warm tonal balance, and slightly recessed presentation of the speaker with some needed bite. Pair these up with an integrated amplifier fromNADor Cambridge Audio and you\u2019ll be in sonic heaven.$399/pair at Amazon.\nRead ourQ Acoustics 3030i Review.\nGet system recommendations in ourQ Acoustics 3030i: Audiophile System Builder.\nFor almost forty years, Paul Barton has been engineering high-performance loudspeakers with a focus on value/performance. TheAlpha P5are small two-way bookshelf loudspeakers at a price point with a lot of competition \u2013 a scenario that makes it hard for products to differentiate themselves enough to be considered category leaders. Make no mistake, the Alpha P5 are remarkable loudspeakers with even modest amplification, but they blow past anything in their price range with a better amplifier with wonderful resolution, tonal accuracy, and a very dynamic presentation that makes them a solid long-term purchase for anyone who loves music.$399/pair at Amazon.\nSee ourPSB Alpha P5 review.\nThe Wharfedale Diamond 12.1\u2019s are the ideal size for a desktop loudspeaker or placement on a credenza in a home office scenario. These stand-mounters are a two-way, bass-reflex\u00a0design. The\u00a05-inch mid/bass driver\u00a0uses a polypropylene/mica composite cone material, and the tweeter is a 1-inch textile dome design that offers a very smooth sounding top end and excellent dispersion. Coherency and detail are both excellent, and we were pleased to hear that they don\u2019t make excuses for poor recordings. Feed them garbage and you\u2019ll know it. Bass response is surprisingly robust to a point; hence the reason why I\u2019m suggesting a subwoofer in this scenario. The Wharfedale Diamond 12.1\u2019s can deliver a punch \u2013 just not a knock-out blow.

The sleek minimalist design dispenses with everything but a clean looking baffle and is only available in either satin white or black. The Q350 are rear ported and require some space between them and the wall to retain their open presentation, while benefiting from boundary reinforcement. They are slightly more reserved sounding than some of their competitors, but they reproduce music with a greater sense of scale and coherency that is hard to resist.$699/pair at Amazon.\nTheRP-600Mhave been a huge success story for Klipsch and helped renew interest in their more expensive Heritage-series loudspeakers at the same time. Despite their reputation for being forward/bright sounding, the RP-600M\u2019s 1-inch titanium-dome tweeter with hybrid cross-section Tractrix horn never crosses a line that makes them sound etched or bright. Horns have ample detail, and it is their overall presence and strong dynamic capabilities that makes these speakers such an engaging listen. The RP-600M are a large set of bookshelf loudspeakers that require proper stands. While not bass monsters, the RP-600M are incredibly easy to drive and benefit from warmer sounding amplifiers.Was $729/pair.Check pricing at Amazon,CrutchfieldorKlipsch.com.\nSee ourKlipsch RP-600M review.\nGet system recommendations in ourRP-600M Audiophile System Builder.\nB&W prolonged the lifespan of the award-winning 685 S2 bookshelf loudspeakers before introducing the 606, but the wait was certainly worth it. A truly engaging pair of loudspeakers designed for both stand or media console placement, the 606 deliver a taste of B&W\u2019s more expensive Continuum cone technology which is usually reserved for its more expensive models. Its 6.5\u201d midrange/bass driver can deliver deep, tight bass that is well balanced against the rest of the sonic spectrum. The lively sounding tweeter will never fail to retain your attention, but don\u2019t get the impression that these loudspeakers are bright sounding. They are engaging and very balanced sounding.\n$899.99/pair at AudioAdvice.comandbowerswilkins.com.\nSonus faber has been manufacturing loudspeakers in Italy for almost four decades (2023 will be its 40thanniversary), and the luxury brand started by the late-Franco Serblin has preserved its reputation for manufacturing the world\u2019s most beautiful loudspeakers with great skill. Sonus faber\u2019s loudspeakers are aspirational products for many audiophiles for both their visual appeal and acoustic capabilities. The Sonus faber Lumina 1 continue that tradition at a much more affordable price.\nOne of the most unique design aspects of early Sonus faber designs was the use of leather on the front baffle; a detail the Lumina I forgo for a leather-wrapped enclosure instead that looks especially striking with the Wenge-finished (real wood veneer) multilayer front baffle. The Lumina collection are available in Walnut, Piano Black, and Wenge \u2013 the magnetic grille covers should be left in the box for both sonic and aesthetic reasons. There are two sets of binding posts on the rear panel for bi-wiring or bi-amping.\nRead ourSonus faber Lumina I Review.\nGet system suggestions in ourLumina I Audiophile System Builder.\nTheChora 806are part of larger group of affordable loudspeakers from Focal that have instant appeal; they are well made, modern and clean looking, and the sound quality is excellent for the asking price. The Chora 806 are front-ported two-way bookshelf speakers that can be set-up close to the wall on a media unit or credenza if that reality applies to you and your room. The Chora 806 offers a really pleasant balance in the upper frequencies and I doubt too many will find the loudspeaker to be hyperdetailed or bright sounding at all. You get all of the extension and detail that you need and nothing more.$990 at Crutchfield.\nSee ourFocal Chora 806 review.\nThe first things you notice about the affordable EVO4.2 are their size and weight; very few bookshelf speakers are 30 pounds and 18\u201d tall. The robustness of their construction translates to their sound quality as well. Wharfedale has built a full-range sounding loudspeaker with layers of resolution, a laid-back sounding presentation that makes it compatible with a wider range of equipment, and an exceptionally airy sounding top end that you rarely find in loudspeakers below $2,000. The overall coherency and midrange transparency make the EVO4.2 one of the best sounding and affordable bookshelf speakers you can find. The one caveat would be the need for heavy-duty loudspeaker stands between 18\u201d-22\u201d to place the tweeter at the right listening height.$999.99 at Crutchfield.\nPolk Audio have been manufacturing loudspeakers for over 40 years, and the L100 might be one of their crown achievements. Unless your listening room is cavernous, the L100 might be one of the best sounding full-range bookshelf speakers we have come across in many years; they do require a lot of power to show off their capabilities and we would suggest 75-100 watts of power (not A/V receiver watts) as the bare minimum. The L100 utilize Polk\u2019s 1\u201d ring radiator tweeter, and 5 \u00bc\u201d turbine cone midrange/bass driver with great sonic results. This is a bold and accurate sounding loudspeaker with a warm midrange and a lot of detail.$999.99/pair at Crutchfield.\nSee ourPolk Audio Legend L100 Review.\nLearn what components pair well in ourPolk L100 Audiophile System Builder.\nELAC\u2019s Andrew Jones has a remarkable track record of designing both price-no-object and entry-level bookshelf speakers that deliver the sonic goods. It is his affordable offerings, however, that continue to inspire delivering sound quality that few designers have proven capable of squeezing out of two-way bookshelf designs priced below $1,500. The Carina BS243.4 raise the bar with its JET folded ribbon tweeter, and 5 \u00bc\u201d aluminum cone mid/bass driver that can energize a room and create an enormous sounding soundstage when set-up properly. The Carina can sound a tad dry with the wrong amplification; tubes are a great option with these sleek looking loudspeakers which do require some power to open up.$1,379.98 at Amazon.com.\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission."

        "content": "Not all vintage buys are wins. I hate to burst that bubble with this week\u2019s installment, but it needs to be said. Now that I\u2019ve had a few years to try a lot of vintage equipment, restore it, and experiment with a lot of amplifiers, turntables, CD players, and loudspeakers \u2013 I\u2019ve discovered more than a few dogs along the way. None of that diminishes the excitement I get from the equipment that has taken up permanent residence in my systems at home, but reality bites sometimes.\nTwo companies that have\u00a0recently\u00a0struck my interest areDynacoandHeathkit;\u00a0specifically their\u00a0homebuilt\u00a0kits which to some degree you can still buy. DIY amps, receivers, and audio scopes\u00a0were not\u00a0uncommon in the 1960s and\u00a01970s. There is certainly a cult of people in the vintage audio community who love both brands; I\u2019ve noticed that a number of high-end audio dealers have a constant flow of Dynaco ST-70 power amplifiers available for sale at really high prices so there must be some demand for it.\nHeathkit and Dynaco sold products that\u00a0featured quality components, detailed instructions and could be completed over the course of a few days with decent soldering skills and patience.\nThe products were available factory-assembled,\u00a0but what made all of these specific\u00a0pieces unique was that they were mostly assembled by hobbyists. Some of these people were quite skilled and knew what they were doing. The finished product could be excellent, or really terrible if the person made serious mistakes.\nThis week, I\u2019m going to dig a little deeper into my own personal experience with two Dynaco and two Heathkit models that I purchased. The results varied from excellent to horrific nightmare worse than the 4 consecutive Super Bowl losses by my beloved Buffalo Bills in the 1990s.\nDamn you Scotty Norwood.\nDynaco was formed in\u00a01955\u00a0by Ed Laurent and David Hafler\u00a0in Philadelphia, and the brand quickly became popular for its affordable and wide range of audio components. The ST-70 stereo tube amplifier was its most popular component; Dynaco sold more than 350,000 units before the brand was liquidated in 1980.\nDavid Hafler had become popular in the Hi-Fi world in the 1950s with his brand,Acrosound. The company had developed high-quality output transformers for use with DIY home electronics and when Hafler moved on and formed the new company with Laurent, they realized that there was a big market for build-it-yourself kits.\nTheStereo 70(ST-70)\u00a0was\u00a0Introduced in 1959 and\u00a0was available as a kit (Dynakit) intended for assembly by the purchaser or as a complete factory-wired unit. The ST-70 used\u00a0four\u00a0EL34\u00a0output tubes, one GZ34/5AR4 rectifier tube, two 7199 input (driver) tubes, two output\u00a0transformers, one power transformer, and a preassembled\u00a0printed circuit board\u00a0(PCB) containing the driver circuit.\u00a0The power output was 35 watts/channel.\nMy journey with the ST-70 started off without a lot of drama; my wife located one that was for sale at a record store in Vermont and we made the trip for New York to take a look. What gave me confidence was that it was the personal unit of the shop owner and he knew everything about it and it\u2019s always reassuring to have the history of a piece of vintage audio equipment before you open up the wallet.\nAfter we agreed on a price, he packed it up really well for our journey back to Buffalo, where it now resides at the home of our neighbor. He has helped me with a number of vintage audio projects, and it seemed like the best way for both of us to enjoy the product. The vintage audio community really has a different attitude in regard to trying products out.\nSince\u00a0the\u00a0purchase,\u00a0the RCA plugs have be updated and the small hum it\u00a0developed\u00a0was remedied by placing it on a book or some vibration isolators.\u00a0DIY indeed.\nThe 35 watts/channel power rating gives one some latitude with loudspeakers; I\u2019ve mated it successfully with every bookshelf loudspeaker I\u2019ve tried with it and it\u2019s a workhorse of an amplifier.\nThe overall tonal balance is quite warm, and I love the powerful presentation that it can deliver with the right pair of loudspeakers. The EL34 is one of my favorite output tubes; for both its tone and the availability of tubes (both new and NOS) from dealers online.\nI can recommend the\u00a0ST-70\u00a0with the\u00a0one\u00a0caveat that you\u00a0really need to\u00a0understand the owner/builder and learn as much history as you can about the specific sample that you find. None of the tubes are very expensive to replace, but you don\u2019t want to get into the business of buying new output transformers when you\u2019re spending a decent amount of money on this kind of amplifier.\nParts are readily available from a number of online dealers so you\u2019re never going to be left out in the woods with the ST-70. The amplifier is a really a great looking piece of equipment and an iconic piece of audio equipment.\nAnother Dynaco amplifier that I purchased was the STA-120. It has a similar case like the ST-70, but that\u2019s where the similarities end. The STA-120 is a 60 watts/channel solid state amplifier, which was rather powerful for the period. I had read numerous very positive reviews of this amplifier, so I made the decision to purchase one without any hesitation.\nWhen I got home and connected the amplifier to the rest of my system, I was somewhat shocked by the differences between the two amplifiers. I was very puzzled by its sonic presentation; cold and distant and nothing changed when I increased the volume level.\nI wondered if I had created a mismatch between the power amplifier and the pre-amp, so I began trying other preamplifiers and loudspeakers. Nothing improved. In some cases, the changes made the amplifier sound even worse, and I could barely get through a few songs before turning everything off.\nI conducted a more thorough examination of the amplifier and did some more research online. What I discovered made me feel that I had wasted money on an amplifier that could be restored and modified with some rather expensive parts but that I was not really listening to a Dynaco STA-120 at that point. This was definitely a huge miss. Not an amplifier that I could recommend.\nHeathkit have been around since the 1920s and are still making kits available for sale.\nThey sold just about every type of electric/electronic kit that you can think of for you to build; their radio kits being the most popular. In the 1960s, they sold tube amplifier kits like the AA-100 which looked and sounded great \u2013 but only if the hobbyist knew what they were doing.\nI found a model AA-21D transistor amplifier and purchased it just because of the industrial design. It reminded me of a \u201860s car dashboard and it was a very clean example.\nWhen it arrived in the mail, I was impressed by the level of packaging. The previous owner clearly wanted it to arrive in perfect working condition and without any dents or new scratches.\nThe power button (hidden behind the logo) was quite clever, and I became very excited to use the amplifier.\nAll the \u201cdashboard lights\u201d came on but that was it. No sound, not even white noise. I opened up the case and checked the usual suspects. I discovered the issue rather quickly. This unit was designed with a handful of self-resetting glass breakers.\nThey were advanced technology a few decades ago (apparently), but every single one was broken inside the unit. I also discovered that replacements were not that easy to locate. The Heathkit has in the repair shop for 6 months. This product earns a \u201cmiss\u201d at this point.\nI was a little depressed after misstep. You want a vintage component to work out but it\u2019s never a good scenario when it\u2019s DOA.\nBut did I swear off Heathkit for life after this disappointing experience?\nNope. I\u2019m a curious type of person and there was another Heathkit product that I really wanted to find.\nAfter seeing an audio scope for the first time, I was hooked. I needed one. The \u201cHoly Grail\u201d of audio scopes is the Pioneer SD-1100; a rare component that is prized for its beautiful silver front faceplate, audio oscilloscope, and VU meters. Anon-functioning sampleof this product fetches more than my audio budget allows.\nMuch to my delight, I discovered the Heathkit Model AD-1013. In a moment of pure madness, I purchased two samples that came with the original build manuals. The price was right, and I hedged my bets that at least one model would work properly with some restoration.\nKarma is a thing. Sharing with others in the community must have earned me some luck because the first unit worked perfectly, and the second unit only required a replacement CRT tube that I was able to source on eBay for a reasonable price.\nThese audio scopes allow you to troubleshoot L/R channels which is extremely helpful when testing vintage equipment. What I use the most is the \u201cstereo\u201d setting which allows you to see (not just hear) the channel separation. It\u2019s neat to see a well-engineered and produced track on the scope \u2014 and easy to see one that isn\u2019t. If you already own or want an audio scope, you need to check out the rather interesting \u201cAudioscope\u201d music being created byJerobeam Fenderson.\nBoth of these brands offer some great value in the vintage audio category, but you really need to do your homework and ask the right questions. The Dynaco ST 70 is a very special audio component that can work in a lot of new systems; not just the vintage variety. Partner this amplifier up with a good pre-amplifier and it delivers so much presence and gestalt with music. If you can find one in perfect shape and you have the right loudspeakers \u2013 a very smart purchase.\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission."

        "title": "The Dual 701 & Yamaha YP-701 Turntables: Exit to Vintage Street",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/dual-701-yamaha-yp-701/",
        "content": "In the early \u201890s I took the digital plunge, and I sold my trusty Technics SL-220 turntable and four milk crates of records. I was moving abroad so this was somewhat of a forced choice, but like many, I also believed the future was digital. The Dual 701 and Yamaha YP-701 were not yet on my radar.\nLittle did I know that vinyl would come storming back 25 years later. I resisted the call to buy a turntable and get back into records, but finally succumbed in September 2018. At this point, I was committedly riding the retro audio train, so the turntable was definitely going to be avintage modelfrom the \u201870s or early \u201880s. I just didn\u2019t know which one. Much to my surprise it became two.\nThe decision to go analog again brought on some serious online research. Being \u201cnew\u201d to vinyl, I didn\u2019t want to spend a lot of money, but very much wanted a reliable turntable that could deliver great sound. On the high-end side I was drawn to models like the Thorens TD-160, Pioneer PL-518, Marantz 6300 and Linn LP12, but my wallet firmly rejected these options. Perhaps someday in the future, but not right now.\nOne brand that consistently popped up in searches as a potential price-to-performance winner was Dual; with plenty of article mentions, and every third or fourth vintage table on eBay and Kijiji being one of their tables. They obviously manufactured a lot of turntables in the \u201870s, and their prevalence was proof of quality and durability.\nDual produced their first turntable in Germany in the late 1930s. They started selling internationally in the late \u201860s with\u00a0their 1009 idler wheel table and added belt and direct-drive players to the product line in the \u201870s. Dual\u2019s best-known units were undoubtedly the 1009, 1219 and 1229 (all idler drives competing with the pricier\u00a0Garrard, Lenco and Thorens tables of the day) and the 701 direct drive.\nI was quite attracted to the design and reported sound quality of the Dual 701, but it was still a bit expensive for my liking. After much research, I settled on a 604 semi-automatic, direct drive for its simple mechanism, low noise, reliability and price. Reports called it one of the more underrated Duals, and I\u2019m a fan of underdogs. A search on Kijiji found one in good, recently serviced condition with a reputable Empire 2000E/iii cartridge. I decided to take the plunge.\nTo get off on the right foot, I also quickly picked up several essential records:Kind of Blue,Aja,New Gold Dream,Avalon,Blue Train,Flight to Jordan,Blade Runner OST,Idle Moments,Wish You Were Here; all great albums with superb sonics.\nTo be honest, I didn\u2019t expect to be so smitten by the entirety of the vinyl experience. On the tactile side, I derived great pleasure from the ritual of interacting with the record and player. Removing the record from the sleeve and placing it gently on the platter, engaging the player and setting down the tonearm, settling in to listen, holding the cover and reading the notes and lyrics, flipping the record part way through \u2014 This sense of musical ceremony was something I\u2019d missed over the preceding 27-odd years of CDs and digital files.\nAnd the ritual element was matched emotionally on the sound side; the warmth and dynamics of analogue \u2013 even the occasional snap, crackle and pop of dust on the record \u2013 touches the soul in a way the purity and perfection of digital never can. Vinyl playback is imperfect. Like real life.\nI found the Dual 604 to be a very satisfying player and was happy with both my turntable choice and the immersion back into vinyl. Fast forward a few months and we moved from condo to house. Suddenly I had two systems in different parts of the house. Initially the upstairs, living room system consisted of just amp, speakers and an Apple AirPort Express for wireless play from my laptop. The main system had turntable, CD player and wireless sources, but soon enough I wanted a second table for the living room, too.\nMy interest in the Dual 701 had only grown in the intervening months. Some of my Instagram friends were proud owners, and they regularly encouraged me to pick up \u201cthe best Dual ever made.\u201d I started looking out for one, but price was still a hindrance.\nOne day, shortly before my birthday, an eBay search brought up a new \u201c701\u201d turntable. Not a Dual, but a Yamaha. This wasn\u2019t a turntable I\u2019d heard of before, but it looked beautiful, and I decided to look into it further.\nThe YP-701 (or YP-700, depending on where it was sold) was Yamaha\u2019s top-of-the-line mid- \u201870s turntable. The belt-drive, auto-return player\u00a0is a bit of a monster, measuring 480 x 410 x 161mm (18.9\u201d x 16.1\u201d x 6.3\u201d) and weighing 9.2 kg (just over 20 lbs).\u00a0It features a medium-mass S-shaped tonearm with universal plug-in head shell, heavy die-cast aluminum platter, and double float suspension (arm and turntable are sprung separately from the motor to insulate against vibration and motor noise).\nNo signal is passed until after the stylus is actually on the record, so there is no thud as the needle comes in contact on start-up.\nThe sound of the YP-701 has been compared in reviews with Thorens tables of the same time period, which may be at least partially due to similarities in the suspension design; in fact this model of Yamaha was nicknamed the \u201cpoor man\u2019s Thorens\u201d by some. I decided this would make a great addition to my audio collection, and a great birthday present, and so a purchase was made.\nAs a side note, I\u2019ve since learned that turntable purchases on eBay can be fraught with issues, the most pervasive of which is shipping damage. I got lucky with the YP-701 in that the seller knew what they were doing and shipped with all pieces suitably wrapped and protected, with bomb-proof double boxing and insulation from vibration and impact. Fortunately, the table arrived in perfect condition. If you\u2019re buying a turntable online, always check seller feedback and confirm proper packaging before finalizing a purchase.\nOn arrival, the YP-701 went into rotation in the downstairs listening room, and the Dual 604 moved upstairs to the living room. I was super impressed with the Yamaha from the first few records. The styling is immaculate, and performance was all that I could have hoped for. The independently suspended platter, motor and arm make this a very quiet turntable.\nIt is a delicate sounding player, particularly sweet in the midrange and treble (not surprising for a Japanese table), but some might find the low end a bit thin and lacking in authority. I found (and find) it particularly good with jazz, classical and acoustic music where detail is of the essence. It may not have the thicker midrange of the classicThorens tables like the TD-160 Super and TD-125, but it\u2019s a very capable deck with a good cartridge.\nIn spite of this Yamaha-induced contentment, something still nagged at me. My Dual 701 friends continued to prod me (yes, I\u2019m pointing at you in particular,Chad G), both to get one, and to do a 701 Battle Royale. My Instagram community was rather interested in the Yamaha, so I decided that I needed both.\nEditor-in-Chief, Ian White, who is a huge vintage Thorens user and big proponent of the work performed by New Hampshire-based,Vinyl Nirvana, took a fancy to my trusty YP-701 and made an offer on it that I couldn\u2019t refuse.\nHe\u2019s been running it with aNagaoka MP-110andDenon DL-A110and has had nothing but praise so far for it. He did have one minor setup issue because I forgot to mention removing the motor cover to install the belt.\nThe Dual 701 (1973-76) is a table of pure simplicity, with platter sitting directly on top of an innovative,\u00a0electronic, low speed motor with feedback-controlled speed precision. The 701\u2019s motor is so quiet and resonance-free that it does not require isolation mounting and is attached directly to the table\u2019s chassis. At the time of production, it was considered to be the \u201cquietest turntable ever made,\u201d as evaluated in independent laboratory tests.\nEverything I read and learned from owners online, convinced me that I needed this Dual. Then on the last day of 2019, there was a new Kijiji listing for a Dual 701. Original owner. With Shure V15iii cartridge. In Calgary. Just 30 minutes from my house. And the price was about half of what I\u2019d become accustomed to seeing in other ads. No time for thinking. The call was made, and I was on my way to check it out.\nSome days \u2013 you just get lucky. Like hit the jackpot lucky.\nThe seller was definitely a lover of music. An older gentleman, downsizing before moving into a senior\u2019s home. He\u2019d sold off most of his system, and the Dual was the last piece to go. Aside from a little wear on the plinth, it was in wonderful condition. I could sense his disappointment at this parting, but also felt he was happy it was going to a home where it would be treated for years to come with the same reverence he had for it. A deal was struck, and I ended the year on the ultimate high.\nThe Dual 701 was all I imagined it to be. It features a straight tonearm (common on all vintage Dual tables), shuttle cartridge mounting system, internal grounding (no finicky grounding wire to attach to the amp), a 2.9 kg (6.4 lbs) non-magnetic, dynamically balanced, detachable platter, auto-start and return, stroboscopic pitch control, and a beautiful wood plinth. It has a relatively small footprint at 420 x 362 x 145 mm (16.5\u201d x 14.3\u201d x 5.7\u201d) and weighs a hefty 10.9 kg (24 lbs).\nThe 701 is authoritative and dynamic, with a big, robust tone. The low-end\u00a0is nice and thick; compare it to any inexpensive turntable made overseas today and you\u2019ll hear the difference. The\u00a0midrange is warm and\u00a0fleshed out\u00a0with good detail retrieval. Treble is pleasing and certainly not lacking, though perhaps outshone by the quality of the lower registers.\u00a0The slightly forward presentation and excellent sense of pace make it an excellent choice for any genre of music.\nSo, quest done? Probably not. The Dual 604 was sold soon after the Dual 701 arrived. I\u2019ve since inherited a Technics linear tracking turntable which spends its days as part of the living room system. And I still have a hankering for a Thorens, Linn, or maybe an old Empire. The adventure never ends, but the joy is in the journey and not the destination.\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission."

        "content": "After reading the firsttwo installmentsof my column, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s become obvious that I have a penchant for used and vintage audio. With the exception of a new phono cartridge that I recently added from Audio-Technica, I have never purchased a new piece of home audio equipment. Not ever. We did take the home theater plunge at one point, but the room was not well suited for all of those loudspeakers and we gave it away.\nThat being said, I have sourced used and vintage audio from almost every place imaginable. We\u2019re going to go on a bit of a buying road trip this week in search of audio treasure but also discuss some of the important ground rules when you decide to take this path to audio nirvana.\nVintage and used high-end audio sounds like a really good idea to people; aside from the cost savings (although the prices for some used high-end components can be extremely high), people crave nostalgia. Not all nostalgia is all that it is cracked up to be, however. There are plenty of lemons in the vintage category. You need to do your legwork.\nBefore we hit the road, let\u2019s talk about used audio equipment.\nRemember to use your common sense when purchasing usedelectricalequipment. Always test the equipment if you can, and with a level of knowledge about the product or you\u2019ll end up with an expensive doorstop. Just because it looks expensive, doesn\u2019t mean that the product didn\u2019t suffer a catastrophic malfunction at some point or was dropped during a move.\nDo your research on the component so you know how to test it. If you have no testing skills or desire to learn how to test equipment properly, do not jump when you find a 60 year-old tube amplifier and just plug it into the wall. Older equipment that has not been tested or serviced in decades can be very dangerous.\nEven if you are comfortable and experienced enough to repair your own equipment, these are all things you need to know before agreeing to a transaction.\nUsed orvintage turntablesrequire a lot more investigation and you want to make sure that the following items are addressed before you decide to buy.\nI know this sounds like a lot of items to investigate when buying a used or vintage turntable, but if you have to fix a lot of these items \u2013 it might be cheaper and less frustrating to buy a new one.\nThere are specialist used high-end and vintage audio dealers, but that\u2019s not our focus for this week as we have something special planned for when it\u2019s safer for us to travel. Ecoustics Editor-in-Chief, Ian White, and I will be visiting some local dealers in New York, and New Jersey \u2013 and possibly visiting a factory or two.\nHigh-end audio dealers will almost always have trade-in products but don\u2019t expect too many rare finds that they are giving away.\nOne thing I have to mention before we go any further is that bad pictures and poor product descriptions do not mean that a product is not worth considering.\nBear in mind that a lot of vintage and used equipment has been sitting in basements, garages, attics, and in storage units owned by widows, retirees, and their families. These people might not have any idea what these components are, and they may not consider it important to whip out the DSLR and create photographic montages worthy of Robb Report.\nI\u2019ve purchased some excellent components that were mislabeled as \u201cspeakers\u2019 when it was clearly an amplifier.\nSo where should you look?\nSmart record stores have begun to sell both affordable audio and used/vintage. It only makes sense as they have a captive audience and it\u2019s hard to listen to a record without a turntable.\nNo \u2013 not off the guy who called you names on Twitter.\nInstagram and Facebook Groups have proven to be excellent places to find used audio and vintage pieces from individual sellers. Retailers often post items they are trying to sell quickly, and you may find a bargain.\nGoodwill and other Thrift stores can be a great place to find equipment, but they have become much more aware of the market, especially because of the resurgence of vinyl.\nPeople tend to liquidate equipment when someone passes away or when they decide to empty the basement or garage. You can visit 10 garage sales in a single day and come away empty-handed or visit a single one and discover gold. It\u2019s a lot of luck.\nPro tip: Don\u2019t be the kind of person who takes advantage of someone\u2019s grief or financial situation and give them $50 for an amplifier or loudspeaker they could sell for $200 or even more.Actually be a mensch and do the right thing. If you find a workingMcIntosh amplifieror Thorens TD-125 MKII turntable for $100 \u2013 pay them more or let them know that they should sell it to a collector. Karma is a thing.\nIf a quality piece of equipment is being sold during a garage sale or estate sale \u2013 there is usually something more that might be of interest. Ask!\nI hope this helps starts you on your journey to purchasing vintage audio. As your experience builds, you\u2019ll be more comfortable with the hunt. Do your research, look what others are running, ask how they like it, join and participate inaudiokarma.org. Look at the \u201csold\u201d \u201ccompleted\u201d auctions on eBay to see what market values are. As a beginner, the vintage audio community will always be welcoming and willing to answer questions.\nGood luck.\nThis article originally appeared atecoustics.comand has been published here with permission."

        "content": "A great stereo system, the saying goes, is only as good as its speakers. Spend all you want on amps, speaker wire, and cartridges, but if the rectangular wooden boxes that push out the soundwaves can\u2019t handle the power or lack the clarity, your otherwise immaculately conceived system will be wasted.\nThat\u2019s another way of saying to be prepared to spend more on, and be more finicky when investing in, these essential components than anything else in your system.\nAs with every decision in our capitalist society, you have the option to buy newly manufactured goods or reuse someone else\u2019s (perfectly good, and excellently crafted) used ones. Both have benefits, but the world desperately needs less new stuff and more recycled stuff. Vintage speakers were built to last and are often easily refurbished..\nAs an inspiration on your quest for better speakers, here\u2019s an advisory tip from a veteran hi-fi collector, via the highly recommendedVintage Stereo and Hi-Fi Equipmentgroup on Facebook:\nCheck FB marketplace regularly\u2026..I got KLH6 speakers for $85\u2026.Advent 1s for $100\u2026..Bozaks for $80\u2026. Kenwood 7400 receiver for $100\u2026.Pioneer sx636 for $100\u2026. Philips 212 TT for $75\u2026\u2026Concept 2QD TT for $140\u2026\u2026ELAC Miracord TT for $120\u2026..Point is\u2026..for under $500 you can do pretty well if you want vintage\u2026.all above pieces were in really good cosmetic condition and work as they should.\nAs a follow-up to our recent primer on used amplifiers and receivers, below is a list of quality affordable speaker brands and models to seek from the golden era of hi-fi.\nHistory: Klipsch was born in Arkansas in 1946 by the brilliant inventor Paul A. Klipsch with his unveiling of the historic Klipschorn speaker system, a game-changing creation that harnessed a trio of separate drivers \u2014 woofer, squawker, and tweeter\u2014 to reproduce, respectively, the signal\u2019s bass, midrange, and treble frequencies. Across the following decades, Klipsch introduced an unimpeachable variety of speaker systems based on the inventor\u2019s technology.\nModels: Volumes have been written about various landmark Klipsch models, the consensus being that the best bangs for the buck are the classic Heritage line model the Heresy. Those in the know, though, say that the KG4, which are smaller and less expensive than Heresy speakers, offer sound quality equal to, or even better, than their older siblings. But a quick Google search will offer tons of guidance.\nHistory: Starting in the 1950s, the Boston metropolitan area became home to a number of revolutionary speaker makers. Few were more essential to the hi-fi movement than audio renegade, inventor, writer, and researcher Edgar Villchur and his student, Henry Kloss. Founded in the mid-1950s to produce reasonably-priced high quality speakers. To say they succeeded is an understatement. Along with classic Klipsch speakers, Acoustic Research is considered the Cadillac of manufacturers.\nModels: If you see vintage ARs, buy them on the spot. Their model numbers are easy to parse: AR-1 was the company\u2019s first foray, and across the decades that number increased as its products evolved. The AR-3 is highly coveted, as are AR-10s.\nHistory: Founded by Henry Kloss after he left Acoustic Research, the former protege shared a similar belief: that great fidelity didn\u2019t have to mean high prices. Dubbed, simply, the Advent Loudspeaker, Kloss aimed to equal the quality of sound generated by AR-3s at half the price. He succeeded, to say the least.\nSuggested models: The Advent Loudspeaker (later renamed Larger Advent speakers after the introduction of the equally impressive Smaller Advent model). The company shuttered in the early 1980s, but managed to sell hundreds of thousands of units across the 1970s.\nHistory: Founded in the late 1920s as Altec, it bought James B. Lansing\u2019s speaker company in the early 1940s and eventually became an established seller of theater loudspeakers. Their \u201cVoice of the Theater\u201d line blanketed the country\u2019s movie houses, and the company moved into the home stereo market starting in the 1950s.\nSuggested models: The company is still active but the quality isn\u2019t there. The early models, A-1 through A-5, are huge; the company moved into home entertainment with the AR-7s, which, like the AR-8s, are highly coveted now.\nHistory: Best known for helping advance Sensurround technology in the 1970s, CV was founded by aerospace engineer Eugene J. \u201cGene\u201d Czerwinski in 1954; he made his name after producing an 18-inch speaker able to hit 130 dB at 30 Hz. The company started selling their now desirable \u201cResidential\u201d line of speakers in the 1970s.\nModels: Early models 24 and 26 are historic. Later in the decade, the company perfected\u00a0models A-10 and A-123, while introducing the R-10 (10-inch, 2-way system), R-12 (12-inch, 2-way system), R-123 (12-inch, 3-way system), 12TR (12-inch Tower Reflecting horn), and (per Wikipedia) 15T tower speakers with 12-inch and 15-inch downward firing woofers, and the model S-1 bookshelf speakers.\nHistory: One of the best known speaker brands of the past half-century, JBL remains an industry leader that has evolved as it\u2019s grown. Founded by James B. Lansing (the Lansing of Altec-Lansing) in 1946 after he left Altec-Lansing, JBL continued despite Lansing committing suicide in 1949. It changed ownership several times before its sales skyrocketed in the early 1970s with its home lines.\nSuggested models: The L-100 was the best-selling loudspeaker model of any company up until\u00a0 that time, and one measure of its desirability is its resale value. Still they were so popular that many old pairs remain in the wild. Other than the L-100s, you can rest assured that most JBL speakers from the 1970s are lifetime investments.\nHistory: Originally the Kasuga Radio Company of Japan, Kenwood opened its first U.S. offices in Los Angeles in the early 1970s. A wildly successful stereo company within a few years, its ubiquity was due to its high-quality components, which sold at mid-price levels.\nModels: Any Kenwood speaker with a model # JL-XXXw are killers\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "title": "Seven Vintage Amplifiers That Won\u2019t Bust Your Budget",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/seven-vintage-amplifiers/",
        "content": "Here\u2019s a scenario that virtually anyone who has entered the home listening game by investing in a vintage power amp or receiver has likely confronted. You\u2019re aware of the brands \u2014 Sansui, McIntosh, Marantz, Pioneer, Harman Kardon \u2014 but you don\u2019t know where to start and you don\u2019t want to mess up by buying something too old, battered or temperamental.\nWe hear you. Unless you\u2019re lucky enough to be the offspring of a noted gearhead like Jimmy Carter, who taught his kids to listen to music through a McIntosh amp and high-end speakers, we all enter audiophilia and intentional listening as novices looking for answers.\nThe good news is that the internet exists, and so do very smart people who know how stuff works. Whole forums are devoted to which companies\u2019 components still hum like Cadillacs and which turned out to be Saturns. For instance, we asked a populous vintage gear Facebook group this question: \u201cWe\u2019re compiling a list of 10 great vintage solid state amps for $600 or so (or less). What models need to be on the list to avoid embarrassing ourselves?\u201d The volume and variety of responses were overwhelming: commenters recommended both receivers and integrated amps, resulting in a drool-worthy bunch of potential purchases.\nBelow: Seven crucial amps that will boost your eardrum intake without denting your wallet too much.\nOne of the best-selling brands of the 1970s, Marantz\u2019s receivers remain easy to find, for now. The 2270, which will run you about $1,000 delivers what the company described in ads as \u201ca walloping 140 watts\u201d per channel. If that\u2019s above your budget, try the 2230, which runs about $700. If you don\u2019t care about an AM/FM receiver, we\u2019d recommend the Marantz 1060 integrated amp, which one commenter called \u201cthe most tube-like integrated amp I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d\n\u201cThe NAD 3020 Is a no-frills, moderately priced amplifier designed to provide state of the art performance and volume levels far in excess of what would be expected from its conservative 20 W per channel power rating,\u201d reads the ad copy for the NAD 3020. A perennial favorite, it was a huge seller for NAD. As such, there are a lot of 3020s around. For a deeper dive on this amp, check outEric Pye\u2018s article\u201cThe NAD 3020 and My Quest for the Holy Grail: Exit to Vintage Street\u201dforecoustics.\nThe original Stereo Review rave from 1970 described the Sansui 4000 as a receiver that \u201cstands with a small, select group of receivers with sufficient power to do justice to almost any speaker system at higher-than-normal listening levels. The Sansui 4000 would rate as an excellent receiver at almost any price. Selling as it does for $379.95, it is clearly an outstanding value.\u201d Indeed, this classic has doubled in price since then on the used market.\nA company that earned a reputation for, in its words, \u201cproducing state-of-the-art power amplifiers at rock-bottom prices,\u201d Hafler offered its models as both kits and finished products.\u00a0This beast of an amp is a lesser-known gem, as are the other models in the company\u2019s DH series, including the 220 and 500.\nFounded by hi-fi legend Robert Carver outside of Seattle, Phase Linear started in the basement of a grocery store in 1971 but within a few years was blowing away audiophiles around the world. A massive amp, it\u2019s another easily found, immediately rewarding purchase.\nSeriously. Trust us on this one: The Harmon Kardon 730 receiver is not only a beautiful thing, but it offers a warmth of tone that will transform the sound of any record for the better. In advertisements, the company characterizes its product as \u201cbeyond specifications,\u201d which is true.\nYou may remember this amp from thesecond edition of our room recordings. The Eico Hf-81 was first introduced in 1959 and is a low powered 14W amplifier that pairs well with efficient speakers (they sound great with our vintage Klipsch Cornwalls). It\u2019s a bit harder to find than the rest of these on the list and may take a bit of work to tune and maintain, but once properly set up, this unassuming amp will beat out most anything you\u2019ll find in its $800 \u2013 $1,000 price range. There\u2019s been a growing cult following around this one so grab it if you can find one at a good price!\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/mcintosh-mc3500/",
        "content": "More than 50 years ago, the hi-fi magazine Stereo Review opened its assessment of the then-new McIntosh MC-3500 monoblock power amp with a note of caution.\n\u201cWe try (not always successfully) to avoid superlatives in our equipment reports. They have a way of backfiring \u2014 something better is sure to come along sooner or later and make us eat our words,\u201d wrote the critic in a 1969 review \u2014 with a caveat.\n\u201cHowever, when it comes to the McIntosh MC-3500 power amplifier, nothing less than superlatives will do \u2014 and it is unlikely to find itself as one-of-a-crowd in the near future.\u201d\nLittle did the writer know. The game-changing power amp upended the concert business after its introduction in 1968. Famously, it powered Woodstock and Altamont, and the Grateful Dead\u2019s soundman Owsley \u201cBear\u201d Stanley started employing the amps not long after they were introduced. A dozen of them, including Garcia\u2019s onstage MC2300 unit, were recently auctioned off during aDead gear auction.\nLast week McIntosh stunned the audio community when it unveiled the \u201csomething better\u201d of the review\u2019s prediction: an updated version of the ground-rumbling amp called the MC3500 Vacuum Tube Amplier Mk II.\nThe massive unit will blow the windows out of your penthouse.\nCheck the overview, according to McIntosh:\n\u201cThe MC3500 Vacuum Tube Amplifier Mk II is a conservatively rated 350 Watt monoblock that takes its inspiration from the original 1968-71 MC3500 and incorporates everything we have learned about vacuum tube amplifier design since the 1960s. It has been upgraded to modern standards and with modern components to deliver an audio performance worthy of its predecessor and the legacy of their shared model number \u2013 all while adhering to the original design as much as possible.\u201d\nThe designers succeeded. Distinctively modern, the blue-tinted output meter is larger and centered on the face instead of offset to the side. It exudes serious power, and while we haven\u2019t been lucky enough to experience one in action, we\u2019ll report back when we do.\nIt retails for $15,000, and you\u2019ll need two of them.\nhttps://www.mcintoshlabs.com/products/amplifiers/MC3500"

        "content": "To hear the speaker-maker Devon Turnbull, whose DJ and graffiti name is OJAS, discuss the intentions in creating his audio company of the same name is to capture with perfect clarity In Sheep\u2019s Clothing\u2019s core mission.\n\u201cI started what I think of as my audio practice out of an interest in this form of listening to recorded music in a way that\u2019s ritualistic,\u201d the Brooklyn-based Turnbull told the King of Audiophilia, Steve Guttenberg, in a recently released interview.\n\u201cI want my hi-fi to be a bit like a shrine. I want to enter a space \u2026 where I can get lost in music and experience music in a way that is more intentional than background music, essentially.\u201d\nTurnbull\u2019s vision has captured the imagination of audiophiles and hi-fi stores the world over. The reasons can be found in his exquisitely designed, Guttenberg-approved OJAS speaker systems.\nTurnbull\u2019s biography, published on the company\u2019s fantastic website, provides a few reasons why:\nOJAS is the creative pen name of Devon Turnbull. As a university student studying Audio Engineering he started using the name across a variety of disciplines including graffiti, music, graphic design and clothing design. In 2003 Turnbull co-founded the clothing brand Nom de Guerre with Isa Saalabi, Wil Whitney and Holly Harnsongkram. For the next decade, while primarily working in fashion, the name OJAS was kept alive on sound sculptures Turnbull was crafting for himself and a growing number of audio enthusiasts around the world. With a particular interest in high efficiency speakers and low powered tube amplifiers, Ojas audio equipment aims to bring realistic, natural sound to the listener. These products are the result of two decades of experimentation, engineering and explorations in the audio underground.\nTurnbull\u2019s interview with Guttenberg offers a look inside the mind, and the creative space, of an audio engineer whose innovations are expanding the conversation on listening culture."

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/isc-guide-listening-bars/",
        "content": "In recent years, hi-fi and listening bars have caught on outside its Tokyo origins with what feels like a new audiophile driven cafe or bar opening daily. Taking inspiration from Japan\u2019s well-established institution of record bars, music and audio enthusiasts around the globe have been building unique spaces, creating environments that appeal to fanatics and casual listeners alike.\nSome have taken a more Kissa-inspired approach, creating intimate pocket-sized venues to showcase a humble system solely used to play album sides. Others have created elite Mancuso-style dance floors to elevate the club experience. Whatever the venue size, we\u2019re always excited to explore new places to discover music.\nBelow, a list of listening bars that have cropped up around the world.\nBased in London\u2019s Kings Cross district, Paul Noble\u2019s Spiritland opened its doors in 2016 and still stands as one of the great new entries in the world of hi-fi bars. The cafe-by-day, bar-by-night venue was built strictly for listening, with an emphasis on in-depth musical programming showcased on their world-class Living Voice sound system.\nVinyl Factory did a quickgear tourif you\u2019d like to peek at the goods, which include their custom Living Voice speakers and crossovers, Triode tube amps, a Kuzma XL DC turntable (!), Isonoe modded Technics 1200\u2019s, and (not featured but a recent update) their custom 50kg solid brass paneled Isonoe rotary mixer. The brass beauty has an unheard of 120dB fader cut for complete silence and is capable of delivering +22dBm (power ratio in decibels ) at <0.0003% THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) (1Khz), rendering it (with even all the faders maxed out) nearly impossible to distort. The front panel is also covered in 10mm-thick brass that slowly decays under the acids of each DJ\u2019s fingers, meaning \u201ceveryone that plays will leave their mark.\u201d\nPotato Head in Hong Kong is the second overseas venue by the Indonesian-based hi-fi / hotel family. Designed by Sou Fujimoto, the vibrant space offers a combo of Indonesian archipelago cuisine, cocktails, and of course, a dedicated \u201cMusic Room\u201d for listening. The room is a discrete backspace with inlaid JBL 4355 speakers, an Alpha Recording System 4100 mixer with their 3500 crossover, and a pair of modded Technics tables. We also highly recommend checking their original Hi-fi offering, Studio Eksotika, in Bali.\nThe Sunshine State gets its first listening bar with Dante\u2019s HiFI, which opened last month in Wynwood. One of the owners, Sven Vogtland, said the bar was inspired by a trip to Tokyo where he jumped around listening bars with his friends Khruangbin. Hoping to bring a level of sophistication the Miami music scene hasn\u2019t seen before, the partners enlisted the legendary DJ, professor, author, and music historian/collector Rich Medina to oversee the music. As for hardware, it\u2019s a little hard to make out what they got powering the house, but the booth contains a new Mastersounds boutique Radius 4 valve mixer, and the bar appears to have a Line Magnetic tube amp paired with a fresh pair of Klipsch Cornwalls \u2014 with some Altec horns, to boot.\nMexico City\u2019s Little Tokyo district holds the new hi-fi spot Tokyo Music Bar. Founded by Edo Kobayashi, the main objective of the space is to provide Japanese food made in Mexico on the same level as it\u2019s served in its homeland. Tokyo Music bar appears to be modeled after the great Ginza Music Bar in Tokyo, sharing the same set of Tannoy Westminster speakers bookending the bar, identical McIntosh MC452\u2019s for power and, of course, a beautiful collection of our favorite Garrard 301 turntables for the spinning.\nPublic Records opened its doors in late 2019 and is the brainchild of Brooklyn residents and partners musician Francis Harris, Shane Davis, and VanderWal. The venue features three unique rooms: a hi-fi record bar, an intimate performance space called the Sound Room, and an all-day vegan caf\u00e9 and record shop.\u00a0Working closely with Devon Turnbull of Ojas and Jason Ojeda of Global Audio Systems, the Brooklyn crew built one of the distinguished sound systems available to the public. With the team using a combination of custom Ojas speakers and tube amplifiers, Altec horns, and custom Isonoe mixers in both rooms. But the cherry on top here is the Sound Room, one of the most immersive spaces the US has to offer; it\u2019s lined with perforated walls and built under the council of Arup, a company that\u2019s brought acoustical engineering expertise to opera houses around the world.\nLocated on the second floor of the historic Romano House, this restaurant-bar-lounge has a lovely wooden and analog feel with a vintage soundsystem designed by Eldad Bermanhuge. The system includes custom made 3-way speakers, Tannoy Little Gold Monitors, and eight Amplifiers, including fifty year old lamp amps. The plant vibe is great as well and, from the photos at least, there seems to be magic happening there throughout the day with local and international selectors playing on a classic Bozak rotary.\nChris Manak aka Peanut Butter Wolf\u2019s Gold Line bar opened up in Highland Park back in 2018. The vinyl-only, whiskey high ball on tap, hi-fi bar and lounge is located directly under the Stones Throws office and houses Wolf\u2019s massive, all-genre vinyl collection that local selectors play from nearly every night. The McIntosh amp, Altec Lansing speaker, Bozak rotary mix soundsystem was put together by Kevin Carney of Silverlake boutique clothing shop Mohawk General Store.\nWe first got tipped to this pocket sized \u201cSeinfeld\u201d reference wine bar by our good friend Linus Booth of S\u00e9ance Centre. The vibe is totally up our alley with local selectors sharing mixes and playing frequently on a sound system comprised of Klipschorns, a Condesa rotary, and McIntosh tube amps. The food looks great as well\u2026\nRhino\u00e7\u00e9ros is the closest thing to a jazz Kissa west of Japan, with its ultra-simple concept: one turntable, two speakers, and jazz. No DJ\u2019s here, with most likely the owners Benedict and Martina playing full album sides from their humble collection that focuses primarily on jazz. Serving up wine and drinks, the speakeasy\u2019s proper emphasis is on\u00a0intimacy and sound. At the heart of this cozy, secret music room is a pair of wooden Bowers & Wilkins speakers from 1976, a round Micro-Seiki Turntable from \u201981, and a quad amp and preamp from the early seventies.\nOur good friend Dor from Fault Radio recently linked us up with the good people behind Oakland\u2019s Bar Shiru. The jazz-kissa inspired, vinyl-only listening bar is the first of it\u2019s kind in the Bay area and focuses on jazz records played in their entirety. The sound system was built by Adam Wexler, owner of Resolution Audio Video, and is comprised of Line Magnetic amps and speakers, an Isonoe mixer, and SME turntables. Additional speakers from Devore Fidelity, Dynaudio, and Bowers & Wilkins are also used in the various listening zones in the space.\nChee Shimizuonce statedof Brilliant Corners, \u201cTo have a place like this is the biggest change in years.\u201d Opened by brothers Amit and Aneesh Patel in 2014, Brilliant Corners has established itself as one of the best around. Located in Dalston, the Mancuso-inspired bar and restaurant holds his iconic four point Klipshcorn system with Mcintosh amps, while serving up meticulously prepared Japanese food and natural wine. We also highly recommend looking into their Giant Steps project, a traveling world class soundsystem containing four Klipsch La Scala\u2019s.

        "content": "On Thursday, Sotheby\u2019s will open bidding on abreathtakingly deep auctionof the Grateful Dead gear, clothing and various archival material from across the band\u2019s 30 year career. The largest-ever sell-off by the band will occur across seven days, offering any Dead obsessive or cover band the opportunity to own, and jam on, a piece of American music history.\nOf particular interest to us, of course, is the gear. Included in the auction are amplifiers, speaker cabinets, rare tweeters used by the band to perfect their sound.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got Wall of Sound speakers that we know were Jerry\u2019s, we\u2019ve got Wall of Sound speakers we know were [Bob] Weir\u2019s,\u201d Sotheby\u2019s Richard Austintold the great Grateful Dead chronicler Jesse Jarnow. \u201cIf you look at the shots of the band, over the drums, we have [two of] those cabinets [used for vocals]. The speakers have been removed. It\u2019s like a thin metal frame, they\u2019re almost like sculpture.\u201d\nThe auction also includes twelve McIntosh MC2300 power amps that powered the Dead\u2019s famed Wall of Sound PA system. Among them, notes Jarnow, is \u201cJerry Garcia\u2019s personal favorite, with a Budweiser sticker on the front.\u201d\nBelow, some highlights, along with details excerpted from the Sotheby\u2019s catalog.\n\u201cLot includes: Sansui 4 channel 130 watt receiver in wooden case. \u2014 2 Klipsch La ScalasSpeakers, painted black, with Grateful Dead spray painted in green, \u201cSupport Your Local Hell\u2019s Angels\u201d sticker, handles on sides. \u2014 2 Hard Truckers D140 Speaker Cabinets, wood, birch plywood, heavy aluminum brackets, one with \u201cSupport Your Local Hells Angels\u201d sticker and \u201cDead\u201d in felt-tip on back.\u201d\nGrateful Dead insider \u201cBig\u201d Steve Parish:\n\u201cThe Klipsch speakers were purchased by Jerry\u2019s mother for the first small PA used by the Grateful Dead, 1966/67, then stored in our warehouse until the early 70\u2019s , when Jerry asked us, as a gesture of friendship, to gift them to the Richmond Hells Angels for a music system for their clubhouse. The 2 black Kllipsch plus the mid range speakers that the crew built and powered by the Sansui amp were used at the Richmond clubhouse from 1973 to 2019. We present this historical small PA with a great history.\u201d\nGarcia\u2019s \u201cBudman\u201d power amp, from the catalog (top): Solid-state power amplifier (10.5H x 19W x 17D), 300 watts per channel or 600 watts per monoblock, with anodized gold and black panel. Serial number: 1Y460. With original \u201cGrateful Dead\u201d black rolling road case with stickers and stencils.\n\u201cBig\u201d Steve Parish:\u201cJerry played through Fender Twins and they were loud, but everyone always wanted to be louder for the big gig, especially outdoors. Dan Healy figured out how to take a line out from Jerry\u2019s guitar amp, first into a McIntosh 350 tube amp during the early Wall of Sound set up. When the 2300 power amp came out we bought 70 of them, and put them throughout the system, but this is the one that Jerry liked the best and he played through it for years. It really made that Twin sound huge and became part of his signature tone at the time. At some point, Ram Rod stuck that Budweiser Budman sticker on it one day and it\u2019s instantly recognizable as Jerry\u2019s.\u201d\nWeir\u2019s power amp (bottom). Solid-state power amplifier (10.5 x 19 x 17\u2033), 300 watts per channel or 600 watts monoblock, with anodized gold and black panel. Front panel with tape reading \u201c1011\u201d below power meters, duct tape reading \u201cM-9\u201d below right power meter. Serial number: ED010. With original white Anvil rolling road case, front with Grateful Dead sticker, lid with Steal Your Face stickers, green tape reading \u201c189,\u201d white tape with \u201cQ2 EQP.\u201d\n\u201cBig Steve\u201d Parish:\u201cThis was used in the Wall of Sound for Bob Weir\u2019s guitar, later used in a keyboard rig for Brent.\u201d\n\u201cBig\u201d Steve Parish:\u201cThese extremely rare old tube McIntosh amps were purchased by Owsley for his P.A. system experiments at Alembic studios, and were used at Altamont. As the years passed, Bear gave them to Ram Rod to use for his home speaker system.\u201d\nFrom the catalog: \u201cThese horn tweeters were standard in the iconic Altec Lansing Voice of the Theater speakers, which were originally part of the Dead\u2019s live sound, before it became evident that the size and weight of these were unsuited to the rigors of extensive touring. The limitations of the Altec cabinets were one of the reasons that the band turned to their own engineers and roadies to design and build the speaker array that became the Wall of Sound.\u201d\n\u201cBig\u201d Steve Parish:\u201cThis was from one of the earliest sets of speakers owned by the Dead and part of a jury-rigged PA system that Owsley built. This tweeter was at Altamont, which is very, very cool.\u201d\nFrom the catalog: Tape recorder (12 x 11 x 6\u2019\u2019). With two \u201cGood Old Grateful Dead\u201d stickers, one \u201cKeep on Trucking\u201d sticker, and one Rhode Island sticker.\nA conveniently sized and sleek battery-powered, four-head recorder with 7-inch reels, XLR microphone connections, VU meters and noise reduction. The present model was one of the best choices of its time for easy recording live in the field.\n\u201cBig\u201d Steve Parish:\u201cRam Rod\u2019s personal reel-to-reel sometimes used by Owsley and Bob Matthews to record live Grateful Dead shows in the late 60\u2019s, early 70\u2019s.\u201d\nFrom the catalog: Speaker cabinet built for the Jerry Garcia Band, ca. 1970s. 4\u00d712 speaker cabinet (19 x 13 x 52\u2019\u2019). Wood and birch plywood, with 4 JBL Model E120 speakers, black cloth grill cover, marked \u201cLOO\u201d in white felt tip, tape on side and bottom.\nFrom the catalog: Open rack for making multiple after show recordings, 1990s. Metal reinforced rolling wooden case (25.5 x 25.5 x 35\u2019\u2019). Crazy Moon smiley face sticker, channels labeled at rear, with two fans for cooling the unit, one on each side.\nRack containing:\nKEBA Research and Development\u2014Real Time Duplication System, consisting of 5 dual open faced cassette decks, patch cables stored in rear. Serial numbers: 111925, 111924, 111927, 111923, 111887.\n\u201cBig Steve\u201d Parish:\u201cThis deck was used to make copies of concerts to give to the band and crew to review the show and adjust the sound and make changes for the next gig.\u201d"

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/tokyo-jazz-kissa/",
        "content": "Currently, about 100 jazz kissa and jazz bars are open in Tokyo. The number of such rooms in the region began to increase in the early 1960s and peaked in the late 1970s. At the peak, an estimated 200 jazz kissas were operating in Tokyo, but only about 20 remaining rooms have been in business since the 1960s and 1970s. In the past, many jazz bars were open in the morning, but as the owners have aged it\u2019s become difficult to maintain extended hours, so many stores open in the evening. Sadly, many shops have lost their founders, so their families and regular customers have taken over management.\nBelow are fifteen jazz kissa and jazz bars founded in the 1960s and 1970s that remain in operation. Each is full of personality and worth a visit. Use this as a reference when you come to Tokyo someday.\n3-14-10 Nishinippori,Arakawa-ku / Founded in 1955/Closed in 2022\nCharmant was one of the oldest jazz kissas in Tokyo. At first, the ground floor was open as a coffee shop and the second floor was open as a bar, but after the founder died in 2010 and the shop\u2019s regulars assumed control of management, only the second floor remained open up until it\u2019s permanent closing in June 2022. The loud volume produced by vintage JBL speakers was intense..\n2-1-11 Nishiasakusa,Taito-ku / Founded in 1962\nA typical jazz kissa in the 1960s, Flamingo was renovated in 1993 to become a coffee shop on the first floor and a jazz bar on the second floor. Its turntables, CD players, preamps, and power amps are all made by McIntosh, and they\u2019re hooked to Altec 802 and TAD TL1601 speakers. The bar has a collection of more than 4,000 records, with an emphasis on piano trios and jazz vocalists. The volume is not so loud, which makes the room a relaxing place to enjoy whiskey and cocktails.\nB1,3-15-2 Shinjuku,Shinjuku-ku / Founded in 1967\nDUG was opened as a sister store to DIG, a jazz kissa in Japan. Conversation was prohibited at DIG, but DUG\u2019s concept was looser, with attendees talking with friends while drinking and listening to jazz. DIG closed in 1983, but after two relocations, DUG is now the most famous jazz kissa in Japan. It\u2019s not a shop where you can enjoy jazz at a loud volume, but the unique and cozy space has created a lot of fans.\n1-8,Yotsuya,Shinjuku-ku / Founded in 1967\nLoud playback with high-spec audio composed mainly of JBL speakers and a collection of more than 20,000 records and CDs, Eagle is a spacious space for relaxing. The venue\u00a0 maintains rules prohibiting conversation from 11:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. but evenings the atmosphere changes to a jazz bar and you can talk until the store closes. If you want to immerse yourself in the world of jazz and enjoy the essence of jazz kissas, please check out Eagle.\n1F Mansion Suzuno,3-2-10 Honcho,Nakano-ku / Founded in 1970\nThe owner is a former staff member of DIG and a well-known record collector. Since its opening in Shibuya, it had been one of the most popular jazz kissas in Tokyo, but in 1989, when it moved from Shibuya to Nakanoshinbashi, it changed its management policy from an orthodox jazz kissa style to a coffee shop that is familiar to the residents of the neighborhood. The audio and records are the same as those used in Shibuya. The volume is low. The owner is old but still alive and well \u2014 and still plays maniacal records.\n5-6-14 Daizawa,Setagaya-ku / Founded in 1973\nIn the corner of Shimokitazawa, which is crowded with young people, a woman has owned and operated this kissa alone for 48 years. Posy was open during the day until about 20 years ago, but due to the owner\u2019s age, she now only opens at night. She has traveled often to jazz festivals in the United States and Europe, and the walls are decorated with jazz legends\u2019 autographs on colored paper. Posy\u2019s not loud, but it has an atmosphere unique to an owner who loves jazz.\n7-61-8 Nishikamata,Ota-ku / Founded in 1975\nChyokuristu Enjin is a Japanese translation of \u201cPithecanthropus Erectus,\u201d the founder\u2019s\u00a0 favorite Charlie Mingus album. After the original owner retired in 2015, a regular customer assumed management responsibilities. The founder\u2019s concept of wanting people to enjoy jazz while drinking coffee or alcohol rather than focusing solely on the records has been inherited. The interior of the store is the same as when it was founded more than 45 years ago. Open only at night.\n1F Izumi Heights 5-31-14 Daizawa,Setagaya-ku / Founded in 1975\nThe owner started this jazz bar after presiding over a theater company and has produced many cultural events so far in the space. Shimokitazawa is a town where many people work in theater and film, which means that actors, film directors, theater producers, writers, poets, painters, illustrators, etc. often come to this shop. Paintings and photographs are often exhibited in the space, and the musical focus is on various types of jazz, from bebop to avant-garde. The system\u2019s not overwhelmingly loud, but it sounds excellent.\n5-33-19 Hakusan,Bunkyo-ku / Founded in 1976\n\u201cEigakan\u201d means \u201ctheater\u201d in Japanese. Before opening the bar, the owner worked on making movies and television, which means it\u2019s decorated with vintage movie posters from around the world. Of particular note is the store\u2019s excellent sound system, which the proprietor has assembled over a long period of time. It\u2019s one of the best in Tokyo, and with a vast collection of rare jazz records, an excellent place to visit.\n2F MarcoPoroBldg,1-8-14 Honcho,Kichijoji,Musashino-shi / Founded in 1976\nThe town of Kichijoji was once crowded with more than 10 jazz kissas. When the boom was at its peak, Scratch opened as a specialty store for crossover and fusion sounds. About 20 years ago, the founder passed over control of Scratch to the bar\u2019s manager, who has continued the business. The selector plays his share of bebop, but focuses on 1970s fusion, which draws a different clientele than many other kissas. It opens at noon and offers a wide selection of food and drink options.\n1-15-15 Taishido,Setagaya-ku / Founded in 1977\nThis jazz bar has been open in Sangenjaya for 44 years. The founder died about 20 years ago so his wife and son took over. The son, an avid jazz enthusiast, plays hardcore jazz, reflecting the sensibilities of his mother, who frequented jazz kissa DIG. Food and drink options include a wide selection of sake and sashimi, as well as whisky and western dishes. Their speakers? JBL 4312XP.\n5-1-2 Akasaka,Minato-ku / Founded in 1977\nThe name of the store is French because the bar originally focused on French chansons, but after it sold the new owner was a jazz freak so she transformed it into a bar specializing in her obsession. In 2011, she relocated from Harajuku to Akasaka. Sound-wise, Volontaire owns vintage JBL LE8Ts built in the 1960s \u2014 a very popular model for Japanese audiophiles and jazz kissas. The JBLs are powered by a JBL SA600 integrated amp, and amplify classic jazz, pre-WWII swing, New Orleans jazz and be-bop records.\n5-17-12 Minamikarasuyama,Setagaya-ku / Founded in 1978\nThis jazz kissa retains its original appearance, so if you want to know the atmosphere of a room in its 70\u2019s heyday, come here. You can feel as if you have traveled back 40 years. After the death of the founder, his wife and son have taken over the management of the store. It\u2019s a coffee shop during the day but a jazz bar at night. Enjoy grooves while drinking alcohol and tasting the dishes that have been around since the establishment. Ragtaime houses about 4,000 records, which ensures continued variety.\n2F YO Bldg.,1-13-6 Kabukicho,Shinjuku-ku / Founded in 1978\nLocated on the second floor of a multi-tenant building in the middle of Kabukicho, the most obscure area in Tokyo, Narcisse has a long history. The owner\u2019s father founded it before World War II, and became a place where novelists and poets gathered. It transformed into a jazz kissa starting in the 1970s. For sound, Narcisse employs British-built Good Man speakers. The owner concentrates on avant-garde jazz, but plays fascinating records one after another while conversing with her clientele.\n4F Miyazaki Bldg,8-2Asahicho,Hatchioji-shi / Founded in 1979\nHarineko is located in the westernmost part of Tokyo. The nearest station to this shop, Hachioji Station, is about 50 km west of Tokyo Station, which takes about an hour by train. At the time of its founding, the owner also ran a bookstore in the same building. The store\u2019s name is derived from the title of one of the owner\u2019s favorite children\u2019s picture books and has an interior designed as a relaxing cafe, but you can listen to serious jazz at a loud volume coming from JBL 4343 speakers.\nNext month, Katsumasa will publish a photo book of jazz kissas including 130 of the Japanese jazz kissas he visited in 2014.\u00a0Divided into Vol.1 and Vol.2, Vol.1 will be published next month and Vol.2 will be published in December. A4 variant version, all colors, about 140 pages each.\nLook out for the upcoming likely essential release on:\nInstagram:https://www.instagram.com/jazz_kissa/\nWebsite:https://jazzcity.store/\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "content": "Though his name is nearly lost to time, starting in the 1950s the writer Hans Fantel was a ubiquitous presence in audiophile and stereo-curious households. A gear columnist who regularly published in Hi-Fi Stereo Review, the New York Times and Opera News, Fantel was the guy who\u2019d sit you down and, without condescension, explain difficult technical concepts in plainspoken, eloquent language.\nTake this basic explanation on the concept of \u201cacoustic feedback,\u201d which, writes Fantel, \u201coccurs when sound vibrations from the loudspeaker travel back to the record player. The phono stylus then picks up the vibrations from the speaker along with the modulations in the record groove and feeds both signals to the amplifier and speaker. The result is \u2014 at best \u2014 a slight tonal blur or a rumbling noise. At worst, the reamplified vibrations pile up, overload the amplifier, and produce a loud rumbling, humming sound that, if sustained, could damage the speakers.\u201d\nFantel\u2019s brief rundown on the importance of choosing a cartridge is concise and jargon-free:\n\u201cAfter the loudspeaker, the phono cartridge has the most noticeable effect on the kind of sound you get from your records. In fact, some golden-ear types have been known to use one cartridge for its warm, blending effect on large-sound orchestral or choral works and another cartridge with a sharper, more analytic response for jazz and chamber music.\nThe reason cartridges differ so widely in the tonal coloration they produce is that, like loudspeakers, they are transducers. Cartridges translate information from one form of energy to another-from mechanical motion into electric signals. As in most translations, certain subtleties are lost-or added-and these account for the sound differences between one cartridge and another.\nAlmost all phono cartridges-or pickups, as they are sometimes called-are miniature electrical generators in which the motion of the stylus as it follows the record grooves generates a voltage proportional to that motion. Precise tracing by the stylus is the first requirement for faithful reproduction.\u201d\nIn 1973, the writer adapted his regular column, Beginners Only, which he changed to Audio Basics in the mid-1960s, to become \u201cThe True Sound of Music: A Practical Guide to Sound Equipment for the Home.\u201d A tool that will help those looking to explore the world of vintage hi-fi, the book tackles the nuts and bolts of sound reproduction with the aim of simplifying the processes for the layperson.\nBelow is a column from the Oct. 1970 issue of Stereo Review.\nThough out of print, \u201cThe True Sound of Music: A Practical Guide to Sound Equipment for the Home,\u201d is easy to find used for under $15, and is filled with illustrations and photos to further amplify his points."

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/building-a-sound-system/",
        "content": "The whole thing can be overwhelming, building a sound system, especially for those whose listening habits have been shaped by device-to-eardrum headphones, which have no concern for the environmental pleasure that comes from filling a room with sound.\nBut broken down, a stereo system for playing records need only involve four elements: Amplifier, turntable, cartridge and speakers. Each piece is essential, of course, but first on your list should be speakers.\nThat advice stems from the truism that a system can sound only as good as its speakers. The reasoning is simple, as hi-fi writer Norman Eisenberg so eloquently wrote in the November, 1975 issue of High Fidelity magazine, one of a half dozen expert glossies covering the then-thriving audio entertainment market.\n\u201cThe speaker is the mouthpiece of your system: it is the device that stirs the unwilling air in your room into the patterns of molecular compression and expansion that you perceive as Mozart or Mancini, Chicago or the Chicago Symphony,\u201d Eisenberg writes.\n\u201cYour big, fat, dumb amplifier just sits there devouring AC power through its umbilical line-cord and converting it into electronic replicas of sound,\u201d the writer continues. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t care less, for its basic operation, whether it reposes in a high-ceilinged restoration of an 18th-century drawing room or in a four-by-four planked outhouse. But your speakers are much fussier. They have to bite into their acoustical environment \u2014 to taste that environment, so to speak. If they are displeased by what they taste, they will let you know at once, like a kid with a plate of spinach.\u201d\nEisenberg\u2019s essay makes an incredibly convincing argument, and is worth reading in its entirety."

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/syng-cell-alpha/",
        "content": "I wasn\u2019t quite sure what to think when I first saw Syng\u2019s Cell Alpha speaker. The clear, almost droid-like design seemed a world (and maybe light years) away from traditional hi-fi speakers or x-point surround setups that I had seen before. Syng\u2019s website provided a few clues. \u201cCell Alpha marks the birth of a new standard in spatial sound. With Triphonic audio, it transforms your space into a field of clear, detailed sound \u2013 a fully immersive experience that puts you at the center of your favorite music and entertainment.\u201d\nI spent an afternoon listening to a dual Cell Alpha setup with Syng\u2019s co-founder Damon Way. The session featured Suzanne Kraft\u2019s\u201cNo Worries,\u201dSlowdive\u2019s\u201cSugar for the Pill\u201dand The Haxan Cloak\u2019s\u201cExcavation,\u201dalong with a few selections of my own including Knopha\u2019sNothing NilEP and the tried-and-true classics\u201cI Believe in You\u201dby Talk Talk and Tracy Chapman\u2019s\u201cFast Car.\u201d\nYou\u2019re not just listening to the song, you\u2019re listeninginsidethe song, which opens up an entirely new world of deep listening.\nIt was immediately apparent that this was not your typical hi-fi speaker. Despite being in a two-speaker configuration, the classic triangle \u201csweet spot\u201d idea did not seem to apply here. Instead, the Cell Alphas produced a crystal clear field that filled the surrounding space. While the traditional instrumentation of \u201cI Believe in You\u201d and \u201cFast Car\u201d was produced perfectly, the speakers seemed to really shine with modern electronics, providing pinpoint accuracy in placing wide stereo sounds within the spatial field. I loved the way heavily panned drums and synthesizers seemed to sweep across the massive sound stage like waves. The dark, ambient white noise of \u201cExcavation\u201d was a particular highlight.\nThe listening session led to an ongoing event series at ourNeuehouse residencyshowcasing the Cell Alpha\u2019s \u201cSuper Spatial Sound\u201d on a four speaker configuration. Curated by dublab\u2019s Mark \u201cFrosty\u201d McNeill, the series has featured modern ambient music with Leaving Records\u2019Matthewdavid and Celia Hollander, spatial dub withThe Scientist, and celestial sounds fromMary Lattimore and Julianna Barwick.\nAfter a month of listening to a broad range of music through these futuristic speaker pods, I\u2019ve found that the best way to explain the experience is that \u201cit\u2019s like you\u2019re sitting inside of the track.\u201d You\u2019re not just listening to the song, you\u2019re listeninginsidethe song, which opens up an entirely new world of deep listening.\nThe Cell Alpha is available now starting at $1,799. Join us for our next listening event withSilent Servant and Robert Laneto hear the speakers for yourself or visitsyngspace.comfor more info and how to purchase.\nTo dive deeper into the origins of the Cell Alpha, I spoke to the team behind Syng about Triphonic sound and how they\u2019re rethinking the art of speaker design.\nThe Syng Cell Alpha is the world\u2019s first Triphonic speaker. Can you explain what that means and what the speaker does differently from traditional stereo speakers?\nTriphonic audio is our object-based sonic architecture. It starts with the Cell calibrating to\u00a0the room that it is in, including wall detection and the position of any other Cells, if you\u00a0have multiples. The software spatializes the music, while the hardware projects the\u00a0 sound to the right place in the room. We deliver a listening experience unlike any other; it\u2019s spatial sound out loud without having to rely on content that has been pre-mixed for\u00a0it.\nWhere does Syng\u2019s Triphonic sound sit within the world of typical 5.1, 6.1, 7.1 surround stereo systems?\nSurround formats are limited to a discrete number of channels that require a separate\u00a0speaker for each one. The Syng Triphonic technology renders those channels in their\u00a0respective spatial locations by appropriately combining the beam patterns of all\u00a0available Cells in the system. As a result, it can render all surround formats (current and\u00a0future) by optimizing the spatial mapping of each channel to a position in the room with\u00a0a much smaller number of speakers.\nI was really surprised by the clarity of the lower frequencies. I\u2019m used to bigger is\u00a0 better when it comes to subs\u2026 Can you provide more detail on how the force balanced subwoofers work?\nThe Cell Alpha subwoofers use extremely powerful motors and have very high\u00a0excursion capabilities compared to typical speakers this size. As a result we are able to\u00a0 move more air, more efficiently, than would be expected from a speaker this size.\u00a0 Additionally, the force balanced configuration prevents unwanted vibration from the\u00a0 speaker enclosure resulting in cleaner sound.\nI love the idea of creating a space where you can feel and touch the sound. It reminds me a bit of dub sound systems where you feel the frequencies through\u00a0 your whole body. What were some of the team\u2019s inspirations when designing the\u00a0Cell Alpha?\nThe founding principle of Syng is to create a single device, that can cooperate in any\u00a0quantity and in any layout such that it forms a single sound field, that can play any form\u00a0of audio content and fill your entire space with precise sound.\nFrom a design perspective, a quote from Christopher Stringer that I think really\u00a0encapsulates his approach is:\n\u201cI don\u2019t ask what shape that I want to impose on a speaker. I ask, what shape does the\u00a0 speaker want to be? My job as a designer is to get out of the way, to pay attention, find\u00a0the simple path through the clouds of complexity and artfully embody principle. Speakers are wonderful subjects in that the biggest component is air, so it is an\u00a0 opportunity to have an expressive design, but what you express is its purpose and our\u00a0purpose is to shape sound, to distill and find the purest embodiment in support of the\u00a0founding principle.\u201d\nObviously, there\u2019s a lot spatially that the Cell Alpha can do besides just playing\u00a0 tracks. It\u2019s still very early but what are some creative ways you\u2019ve seen the Syng speaker system used so far in spaces?\nFrom the beginning our thesis was that music was trapped in an aging format that could\u00a0not support immersive new media experiences due to its lack of flexibility and range.\u00a0We felt that we could push through this, and create new ways for sound to be\u00a0experienced. This led to a number of experiments involving the separation of songs into\u00a0 their discrete parts, and allowing for the listener to apply agency over what they were\u00a0 hearing through interactive and spatialization tools. Pieces of this will be introduced over\u00a0 the next year for which we will be sure to keep you informed about.\nSyng seems to have a much broader goal of advancing sound. Do you consider\u00a0 these speakers to be a replacement for traditional hi-fi systems or an alternative?\nThe problem with traditional hi-fi systems is that while they sound amazing, they are too\u00a0 complex for the average user, with a steep learning curve. The alternative options on\u00a0 the market are easy to use but sacrifice on experience and sound quality. Syng can be\u00a0 an alternative for people who want great sound but a simpler system or a rest of the\u00a0home addition for people who have existing hi-fi systems.\nWebsite:https://syngspace.com/\nInstagram:https://www.instagram.com/syngspace/"

        "title": "10 Brilliant Takes on Turntable Plinth Design",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/10-turntable-plinths/",
        "content": "The physical experience of playing vinyl helps listeners rationalize elaborate customizations, from record shelves to speaker stands. One of the most gratifying, and perhaps most important areas to upgrade, is the turntable itself.\nManufacturers in the \u201860\u2019s and 70\u2019s like Garrard and Thorens actually created record players meant for aftermarket meddling. In fact, in early department stores merchants made selecting the perfect plinth \u2014 the oft-wooden or metal turntable base \u2014 as easy as selecting the stain color of new kitchen cabinets.\nFor the most part these turntable bases do have some utility. Heavy woods, metals and raw stone all help mitigate the ricocheting of sonic waves that come with listening, which contain the potential of affecting sound quality \u2014 though there is something to be said for design for design\u2019s sake, so expect that to be celebrated here too.\nBelow, some exquisite turntables embedded in custom plinths.\nRon Arad\u2019s \u201cThe Concrete Studio\u201d was in one of his 1983 exhibitions and is among his most iconic works. Arad used concrete to convey an apocalyptic HiFi aesthetic, in the process conjuring up fantasies of a science-fiction dystopia. The complete set-up includes a concrete turntable, amplifier and two speaker towers.\nThis acrylic base is no doubt inspired by dutch abstract painter Piet Mondrian, with its irregular grid pattern of mostly primary colors. A Garrard 401 is cradled in the plinth; the turntable\u2019s compact design made it ideal for an easy weekend customization project.\nThis plinth is a hi-fi masterpiece made by forum user \u201cOvenmitt\u201d and shared on the popular vinyl lovers platformwww.whatsbestforum.com. The hobbyist used a Garrad Pearl for this plinth project, and details the components of his turntables as being made up of \u201cPanzerholtz, Ebony, cherry and/or maple, bamboo, aluminum, and soapstone\u201d. Each of these materials was used in a variety of different ratios, and each created a different sonic personality.\nThis Garrad 301 is set in a stunning block of marble that looks like a 3-D snapshot of the deep ocean. Made by Holger Trass ofanalogue-classics.com, this singular set up does a beautiful job highlighting the turntable and the contrast of the stone.\nThis Garrad 401 was planted into a solid mass of marble by another hobbyist with the username \u201cDoctor Hugocat\u201d fromdynacotubeaudio.forumotion.com. The stone offers a \u201charder\u201d sound, and is most definitely a statement piece. If you\u2019re curious why this one has two tone arms , it\u2019s because having two tonearms or more in your setup makes it less of a hassle to switch-up needle cartridges.\nAudiowood, based in New Orleans, makes custom turntables informed by nature. This burnt piece of burl wood is imposing and serious, and it\u2019s wild organic shapes make for a stunning display.\nThis Garrard 301 sits in a plinth made out of Baltic Birch Plywood, Panzerholz\u00a0 and a layer of man made Slate. It\u2019s the most conventional looking plinth on the list but its intricate wood grain and warmth is worth marveling over. The plinth was made by hi-fi outfitWoodsong Audioin Sandpoint, Idaho.\nYes, another Garrad 301, this one set in a beautiful 90\u2019s acrylic plinth made by DAS Acoustics. The stands that support the unit help reduce environmental noise, creating a perfect listening experience.\nThis Garradd 401 has a minimal coolness that\u2019s evergreen; it was shared by theanalogdept.com. Two cross-sections of what appears to be birch are immaculate specimens, part of a brilliantly designed project.\nThis Plinth was an official option for buyers of Thorens turntables in the 70s. The two tone wood has a balance that\u2019s both sophisticated and playful.\nIf you\u2019re feeling inspired to make your own plinths now, The New Yorkshire Workshop has a well documented how to.

        "content": "With all the time, money and effort spent buying and putting together the hi-fi components of your dreams, if your speakers aren\u2019t positioned properly in your listening space, your goal of achieving the best possible acoustics will remain elusive. All speakers are built differently. As such, each pair has unique placement specifications. At the same time, your listening room has its own dimensions and layout. Most often, proper speaker placement for any given room is achieved by trial and error. The fix can be as easy as moving your speakers closer to your listening positions or doing the opposite: pulling your chair or sofa closer to the speaker themselves. But other variables come into play when plotting for your own sonic sweet spot.\nBelow, we offer tips on how to best attain optimal fidelity in your listening room. With any luck, the pointers here will help enhance your sound with a few relatively simple tweaks that will allow you to inhabit your own audio Nirvana.\nBefore you start moving around your speakers around your listening area, first try to figure out where you will be situated in relation to your setup. Identify the ideal listening spot\u00a0 \u2014 called the focal point or the center of the space \u2014 where the sound will be most balanced. You will want to be in the exact middle and approximately 5 to 10 feet away from your primary speakers. With two-channel arrangements in particular, it\u2019s crucial to maintain a balance between the speakers in order to give equal weight to each channel. Otherwise, you run the risk of one channel overwhelming the other, muddling sound quality and drowning out nuances in the recording.\nThe importance of symmetrical speaker placement for near field listening, especially in small to medium sized rooms, is hugely important for optimizing stereo sound quality. For the truest stereo image when setting up for a 2-channel speaker system, the pair of speakers and your head should form three points of an equilateral triangle. The listening position is determined by the \u201ccenter to center\u201d distance of the speakers from each other and the distance to the listener\u2019s ears. It does not refer to the room dimensions in any way.\nCheck 7 Quick Tips from U-Turn Audio here:https://uturnaudio.com/pages/speaker-placement\nThe \u201ctoe-in\u201d is the way you aim your speakers, and there\u2019s no specific answer to how much adjustment your specific system will require. Some speakers require none at all, but most will show notable improvements in overall sound quality and imaging when they are slightly toed-in towards your listening position. Be forewarned: too much toe-in will neutralize the stereo imaging to the point where you hear two independent speakers. It is very important that both speakers be equally toed-in.\nThe simplest way to accomplish this is with a measuring tape. It\u2019s also helpful to have a partner help with this procedure. Start by toeing the monitors one inch in. Listen to some good recordings \u2014 such as anything with a wide dynamic range \u2014\u00a0 and pay attention to the stereo imaging. Increase the toe-in to two inches and repeat. Did the sound waves become more pin-pointed and detailed? You\u2019ll want to do this several times using various measurements, depending on the types of music you listen to. Feel free to experiment. The goal is to make the sound field as life-like as possible.\nGiven their inherent size, bookshelf speakers allow for many placement options. They can be positioned on stands, put on a rack or a desk, hung from the wall or ceiling. They can even be put on an actual bookshelf. As with any speaker, try to create an equilateral triangle between the speakers and your seated position.\nBookshelf speakers are widely used in custom installations where the speakers are fitted into wall units, with excellent results, and can often provide an even richer, more full-bodied sound. Nonetheless, try to isolate your bookshelves as much as you can, leaving as much space around them as possible.\nAs with any speakers, they need room to breathe. The more space they have around them the better. Place them at least six inches out from the back wall and try to keep them away from anything that could potentially be an obstruction. The ports that are built into these things are usually in the back, which allows for the airflow that controls the speakers bass response. Giving them space will only maximize their performance.\nPro tip: bookshelf speakers should never be placed on the same rack or shelving unit as your turntable. If you do, the speakers will resonate sonically through your turntable and vibrations will play back through the speakers themselves. You do not want this. As well, because bookshelves and cabinets are usually located close to the wall, situating speakers on them will generally reduce the soundstaging and imaging performance of loudspeakers.\nGenerally these are the biggest speakers you can buy for your home. They stand somewhere between 3 and 8 feet tall and need a lot of space to get the most out of them. This usually means a larger room, as they should be given room both behind and to the sides. A good estimate is at least two feet from the back wall and a foot from the side walls. This \u201cboundary loading,\u201d as it is called, will ensure proper bass dynamics with the least amount of speaker reflection and reverberation.\nTower speakers are powerful but if they are too close to the walls they will create too much bottom end and be boomy. Not good. Speakers work in tandem (stereo), so the equilateral triangle rule remains the goal for optimum sound performance.\nThe room itself has a huge impact on sound. Rooms are constructed with a range of materials\u00a0 and each has its own distinctive sound architecture. More often than not, your listening space hasn\u2019t been designed for optimal acoustic sound dynamics. While there isn\u2019t really anything you can do with the inherent dimensions of the room, \u201croom treatments\u201d are available to make the sound in your space as good as it can be. Fortunately, furniture, rugs, curtains and even plants can help control a room\u2019s reflective echo chamber, but these things alone are not enough to properly control most listening environments. This is where \u201croom treatments\u201d come in.\nFor obvious reasons, the sound reflection off of bare hard surfaces does not resonate and is never your friend. A rug placed near the speakers or, ideally, carpeting, will sound better than hardwood or concrete floors. Carpeting will help control that bounce off the floor, and is by far\u00a0 the best way to dampen sound reflections.\nAudiophiles like to put spikes and cones under everything. They look very \u201cpro\u201d, and while they add a certain cool factor to the aesthetics equation, in many cases they do more harm than good. Plywood sub-floors are, in many ways, similar to acoustic guitars in that they can act as a resonating surface. Spiking a speaker \u2014 placing pointed \u201cfeet\u201d on the speakers \u2014 to this type of sub-flooring, whether it has hardwood, tile or carpeting, creates a large vibrating sound-box. This is especially true with subwoofers. However, spikes work wonders if you have carpet over concrete and will go a long way toward minimizing vibration and enhancing your sound.\nWalls are giant reflective surfaces. Windows, mirrors, artworks with glass frames and even your television are even worse. Furniture, bookcases, curtains, drapes, non reflective artwork and/or anything that absorbs sound and breaks up that flat wall surface will help minimize a room\u2019s reverberation and improve your acoustics in a big way. One of the other best ways to reduce this echo chamber effect is to get sound panel diffusers. Diffusers are a room treatment that breaks up the room\u2019s reflection through, as the name suggests, diffusion and sound dissipation.\nOne of the leading room treatment companies isGIK Acoustic. They offer a variety of sound solutions and can do custom orders and installations to suit your own treatment needs.\u00a0Check GIK Acoustic Panels here:https://www.gikacoustics.com/product-category/acoustic-panels/\nAll speakers and listening rooms come in all different shapes and sizes. The best way to determine how to glean the best sound from your set up in any given space is to experiment. Along with the tips provided here, be open to the idea of moving your speakers around to find the best sound for them within your listening room. Using the equilateral triangle as your baseline, there is much tweaking to be done, whether it be \u201ctoeing-in\u201d your speakers, throwing down a rug or adding some simple acoustic panelling. By trying out some of these different speaker positions and room treatment techniques, you should be able to find what sounds best for you."

        "title": "Discrete Circuits: An Interview with Condesa Electronics Founder Mehdi El-Aquil",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/interview-condesa-electronics/",
        "content": "Based in Adelaide, Australia,Condesa Electronicsin the past decade has been quietly assembling some of today\u2019s most sought-after hi-fi DJ mixers and equalizers. Crafted by hand with an emphasis on clear and present sound, Condesa takes cues from the iconic makes of the past and arguably rivals those great rotary models it\u2019s aspiring to.\nSince its humble beginnings, the boutique mixer makers have found fans in respected DJ acts such as Marcellus Pittman, Sadar Bahar, and Palms Trax. Its machines have piloted the dance world\u2019s greatest booths and facilitated intimate deep listening rooms across the globe. We had a Condesa Carmen at the In Sheep\u2019s Clothing hi-fi listening bar.\nOur conversation details Mehdi\u2019s trajectory into discrete circuits, from the small electrical bits of his youth to discovering the ultrasimple yet beautifully colored signal paths of the great seventies rotary mixers. We touch on Condesa\u2019s future, the \u201crotary cult\u201d and how desperation for a coveted sound spawned one of Australia\u2019s greatest musical exports.This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing: To dive in, I\u2019d really love to hear Condesa\u2019s \u201corigin story,\u201d how did it all start?\nMehdi: Basically, I was always interested in pulling things apart and putting them back together when I was a kid. I remember ruining some watches, wearing them in the bath (laughs), then taking them out, drying them up, and trying to get them to work again. Little remote cars and stuff. I had an interest in electronics. I was into art as well, so I wanted to be a bit creative with things. But yeah, I was obsessed with batteries, light bulbs and motors and how they could work together. I remember finding some in school. I was put in detention or something funnily enough, and I was put in a room. I was bored, I\u2019d done my lines, and I found this box with electrical bits, and I started connecting them and began playing around with that stuff.\nWhen did that evolve into building music-related equipment?\nWhen I left school, I got an apprenticeship in electronics that had nothing to do with musical stuff. I was into music, from breakdancing and electro music, how all that was mixed together.\u00a0 That really caught my imagination. I was into music and when I left school I was trying to DJ, and just you couldn\u2019t get stuff like that. The first DJ mixer I got, when I was about 17, was a Phonic DJ mixer and I had to order through a PA shop and it took ages to turn up. I had two really crap turntables, one Technics that took me a long time to save up for and I had a rubbish sort of belt-driven various speed deck, and for a long time that was my set up (laughs).\nI think growing up in that era and not having affordable DJ products made it happen. Like, you can make something. That\u2019s kinda how I got into electronics and wanting to make bits. I always had jobs in electronics like setting up sound systems. Eventually, electronics went away from average jobs and I started working on sound systems and repairing stuff. I saw a lot of how things could fail. That helped me a lot when I started building mixers myself.\nIt\u2019s funny, Ikutaro Kakehashi, who created Roland, also started with watches. I love how a lot of these respected electronic engineers all started there.\nYeah, it\u2019s amazing, maybe it\u2019s a craft thing or needing to concentrate and see how things come together on small detailed things.\nSeems like a simple entryway, for sure.\nYeah, definitely. And I think it applies to that sort of thinking in the end. Electronics was never hard for me. Like, there was just a nice overview, the same with math. I know it scares a lot of people, but I could always think of shortcuts through the numbers and ways to simplify that wasn\u2019t the \u201cofficial\u201d way to do it. So yeah, that side of things wasn\u2019t that hard. And I remember looking at electronics and seeing them, to be able to see them as blocks. \u201cThat bit is the preamp and this bit is the mixer and this bit is the output.\u201d\nWas there a mixer that you discovered in that early period that inspired you to start building your own?\nReally there\u2019s two, and it was much later running into all of this. I did electronics. I left school in \u201887 at the age of 16 and started doing an apprenticeship that took me ages to actually get that job and then I was doing electronics full stop. And at that age, I was into collecting records and attempting to DJ, I say attempting, because I mean, unlike now it seems that because of online courses and stuff, people can learn how to DJ quite quickly.\nIt took me about two years of practicing and recording mixes at home to get to some proficiency. Every day I would get up or every evening I would get back from work and mess around. Maybe sometimes it was the same four records trying to put them together, trying to work out really bad, wrong mixes (laughs). Yeah, but learning techniques. I always used to use fader mixers. And I got introduced to the idea of rotary mixers, it must have been around 2008. I was reading, looking up stuff like the history of the original discos and clubs. I did know before then the Ureis and Bozaks, I knew of them, but I never was able to put my hands on one and test it. And I remember, I got my hands on a Bozak here, for a club owner \u2014 a friend of mine that actually bought one to put in the club and I needed to service it. I listened to it and I was really impressed by the original \u201870s circuitry and how amazing it sounded. At the same time, I\u2019d been making studio equipment, I\u2019d be making clones of compressors and micro-pre\u2019s from the same era that use discrete circuitry. So I knew a lot about the circuitry and how these simpler circuits sounded so much better than a lot of the newer stuff. That blew me away.\nThat's discrete circuits versus integrated circuits?\nYeah, but that said, I also worked on an Urei 1620 as well and that sounded amazing. And that does have integrated circuits, but it has a blend of integrated circuits and discrete circuits. But the signal path, once again, is minimal. There\u2019s not much in the signal path. I remember checking a Rane scratch mixer at the time. A TM 52 or something like that. And from the beginning, from the first input to the last output, it went through, I can\u2019t remember but a ridiculous amount of operational amplifiers \u2014 27 of them in the signal path! Even though each little microchip has super good noise and distortion figures and everything else, it degrades it a tiny bit, and even if there\u2019s 27 of them they can still sound good. But when you put it against something like an Urei 1620 or an original Bozak, it\u2019s day and night.\nI'm a bit of a novice when it comes to mixer builds and circuitry, but for faders and rotaries, is there a simple way to distinguish them? Other than a smaller signal chain, and obviously the knobs versus the faders..\nI mean the knobs versus faders. But in my thinking, it\u2019s really just a different approach. Both of them are valid, I wouldn\u2019t say one is better than the other. It depends on the person. Like horses for courses, tea versus coffee, it depends on the person using it. But I think if you\u2019re making the switch, being able to put yourself forward as a DJ and say, look this is what I can do: the faders allow me to do this, this and this, and I think when you make a choice to go to rotary, you\u2019re saying hold on a second, I\u2019ll put what I can do technically aside. What I want to be first and foremost, at the front, is the best sound quality. I want it to sound as best as it can. And I think that\u2019s the distinction that rotaries versus faders usually makes. There can be fader mixers that can be as good sounding or have exactly the same circuitry as a rotary mixer. It just doesn\u2019t seem to happen as much.\nIt seems like a lot of companies are starting to make them too. Resident Advisor wrote an article a few years back called \u201cThe Cult of Rotary Mixers.\u201d What are your thoughts on the rotary boom? At the same time, it may not just be a DJ thing. There really seems to be a collective, growing desire for higher quality audio.\nWhat I used to say was, \u2018Wow, we were really lucky to start making mixers when we did, to catch this wave. This was really good.\u2019 And then I thought about it a second time and I thought, \u2018No, actually, maybe we just added some water to that wave. Maybe what we\u2019re doing at Condesa is a small part of this growth. So we\u2019ve contributed to it rather than just being lucky and being in the right place to jump on it. We\u2019re one of the companies that inadvertently helped to grow this thing. So I think it\u2019s really good. I think if anyone that\u2019s into music is going, \u2018Can I get it to sound better? Can I have the experience oflisteningto it?\u2019 It\u2019s the same in venues. If I go to a venue, so many of them are badly set up for sound.\nReally nothing worse than a great room with a terrible setup.\nHappens all the time, when you find yourself in a great venue, even if you weren\u2019t dancing, ultimately, it\u2019s the music. My thinking is, I want the music not to bash you over the head, not to drag you onto a dance floor, not to force you into anything, but to seduce you. I want the sound to be seductive. I want it to catch you. So you\u2019re like, \u2018Wow, I\u2019m going to get a bit closer to this. This is a good feeling. You know, it\u2019s not a bad feeling. It\u2019s not a hurtful feeling. It\u2019s not giving me a headache.\u2019 I mean, a lot of that counts on the source music being played, of course.\nThat\u2019s one thing with the discrete circuitry. It has a clear presence. Discrete circuitry can be as good or bad as the design, but if we go into what we make, it has clear highs. They have presence but they\u2019re not aggressive. There are so many times I\u2019m out and I hear top end, sharp, and cutting like that(stabbing motion). And it\u2019s like, Whoa. Even when you EQ it, even if you go up to the front-of-house mixer and you turn the highs down, it\u2019s still there! That aggressive top end is horrible.\nThere is a lot of bad audio out there. And if people move into rotary mixers means that they\u2019re going to a place where they\u2019re reallylistening,it can only enhance the enjoyment of the music. Another way to think about it is if a Condesa makes you, the music lover, the DJ, have a better connection to the music or the listeners have a better connection to the music then our job\u2019s done. If the connection\u2019s better \u2014 if people turn up at a venue or come to someone\u2019s house and play some records, or even\u00a0 digital that\u2019s mastered well and goes \u2018Wow. I spent my whole night really listening to stuff that I had and never realized how good it sounded, then our job\u2019s done. That\u2019s really the price of it.\nDid you happen to make it down to that Fairfield Amphitheatre show recently with Marcellus Pittman?\nI didn\u2019t! No, I didn\u2019t see it.\nI saw a few clips and the setup looked amazing. Thought you might\u2019ve had something to do with it.\nYes. I spoke to him about it. That was brilliant, used all Klipsch speakers. He\u2019s been staying over here for awhile and I\u2019ve caught up with him and Driller for dinner the other week. And I think he\u2019s back over this weekend, so I\u2019m going to go and check him on Saturday night, but yeah, the Fairfield setup looked amazing.\nThink they had La Scala's as monitors. When I saw that I was just like, oh my god.\nYes! They really went to town! I spoke to the guy who set it up and he was asking me about levels with the mixer to try and get the volumes right, too and it seemed to work really well. I heard it was an amazing vibe, really rich sound.\nDo you have any ideal speakers in mind in the design of these? I mean, it seems that Klipsch and Condesa are a perfect marriage.\nYeah, that\u2019s a nice mixture. I don\u2019t, what I would say with the Condesas, like people say, \u201cOh, it\u2019s really colored. It\u2019s really colored.\u201d But it\u2019s pretty flat. I mean, the isolator does add some peaks to the sound but there\u2019s a bypass switch. That means that the sound is quite flat. But what people don\u2019t realize is the Condesas run all the way down to 10 Hertz. So you\u2019ve got extended bass and even if you don\u2019t have bass there, you have the harmonic subsonics there that most manufacturers are rolling their bass off of 30 Hertz. They\u2019re cutting that 20 Hertz off. And I know we\u2019re only meant to hear to 20 Hertz, but it\u2019s open. I\u2019m not going to change that design but that makes a big difference if the system\u2019s set up right.\nSo full-range speakers are what I think would sound really good. I\u2019ve never had an ultimate idea, but when I hear how fast and reactive the Klipsch speakers are, they sound really good. But I also think that they do need some extra support for subsonics and modern music too, just to give it that little extra oomph if it\u2019s a dance vibe. But if it\u2019s set up in a listening room and they\u2019re in the corners of the room, they could work beautifully.\nIt really does, that's what we had in our space. Klipschorns and a Carmen.\nYeah, that looked brilliant. That setup was so amazing. I was planning to come over, but this whole covid nightmare.\nHope you guys were alright during the pandemic and were still able to operate and fulfill orders safely.\nYeah. It was weird for the first month. It was quiet, we didn\u2019t get one email and I was like, okay, all right, this is how it\u2019s going to go. Let\u2019s just batten down the hatches, catch up with what we want to do and put one foot in front of the other. And then after that, bam, the next month went crazy. It was twice the amount of orders and it\u2019s been busier than ever, ever since really.\nYeah, I feel like a lot of people turned to music during this time, started to approach it differently, and rethinking their home setups... I'm sure a lot of people sought you guys out for that.\nHave you seen people buy more vinyl and wanting to buy different, more broad music, and good home listening music?\nWe have a very humble, curated selection so it's not a great way to gauge, but I do know of a lot of people that refined their personal systems due to all of the home-time.\u00a0 Even me, I bought a.... I'm so sorry\u2026. A _____ mixer.\nThat\u2019s alright! (Laughs) That\u2019s a great mixer and actually, they\u2019re really good value. Yeah. That\u2019s amazing.\nI'm saving up for a Carmen V. You\u2019ll see my order in a few months. (laughs)\nStill, it\u2019s the same movement and I really had to think this through and it took a bit of time. Cause I think I used to feel quite a bit of pressure when new mixers and other things got introduced. And then I thought to myself, I\u2019m being really precious about this. You know, this is an open market and there are plenty of good mixer designers out there.\nHas the Condesa operation grown? Are you still building everything yourself?\nYeah, I can\u2019t build everything myself, we have help. We\u2019ve got a crew, there\u2019s about five of us which is great. Everything\u2019s done here locally in South Australia, we get the circuit boards in, we get the parts in, and the guys begin to solder and populate. Everything\u2019s done by hand, solder and populate the boards. Looms are made up. Someone draws out the wood and lines it, faceplates have controls put on, wirings put together with the circuit boards, mostly done by Dave, my right-hand man. We\u2019ll do batches of 10. Everything comes from me even if I\u2019m not building every one of them.\nI\u2019ve been really enjoying your guys\u2019 mix series. (Discrete Circuits)\nYeah, Lauren\u2019s been running that and sort of picking stuff. I know a lot of people kind of approach me and say, Oh, can I do a mix? I\u2019ve got a mix. Lauren\u2019s on quality control. So I can\u2019t undermine what she\u2019s doing. It\u2019s been a nice series. One quick thing about the mix series is our connection to, if I could use the term, the scene and DJing. Like, digging and discovering new music and discovering old music, vinyl, but also digital, all mediums \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter. But our connection to all of that is really strong. It\u2019s really an important part of it. We\u2019re not doing it to feed off of that. We\u2019re doing it because we believe we\u2019re part of it as DJs and music lovers too. I\u2019m referring to, say, maybe me, Lauren, and how the ethos of the company is, otherwise I wouldn\u2019t have made a mixer. The reason I made one is because I looked at the Ureis and Bozaks and I said, \u2018I\u2019m fucked! I can\u2019t afford one of those, and I really want one but hold on, I can make one.\u2019 That\u2019s where it all came about. Like, this is a side effect of liking the music and wanting technology that can work with the music rather than, \u2018Oh, let\u2019s make a mix series and let\u2019s infiltrate ourselves in this scene to be seen as part of it, to sell more mixers. No, forget that, we feel we\u2019re part of it.\nYeah, during those early years, was there a person, a DJ, someone you looked up to that you were really excited about who bought your mixer. Someone that made you realize, like, oh I\u2019m actually doing something pretty cool here?\nYeah. There were several. And sometimes it would just be like email inquiries. And even if they didn\u2019t follow through, there were several that really excited me and was like, \u201cWow, this is coming full circle because I\u2019ve been buying this person\u2019s records for ages. And now they\u2019re asking for a mixer. This is crazy.\u201d So it happens all the time. Even now it happens. But I guess one of the first people, was maybe Marcellus himself, he went, \u201cOh, I want a Carmen, but you need to put an isolator in it for me.\u201d\nI was always gonna do it, it was always in the cards for me to get to there, but him saying that really pushed me to go, all right, I\u2019ll get it done. And I\u2019ll do it on the strength of him asking me. That was a good, inspirational shove to get me to develop it. So, yeah, he was definitely a big one, but there have been lots of different artists and DJs that I\u2019ve looked up to now that have bought mixers. And there\u2019s sometimes I didn\u2019t even realize, and I\u2019ve seen stuff posted, Oh, that\u2019s the person that owns that label. I didn\u2019t even realize that. Wow.\nYeah, I feel like I see them everywhere.\nYeah. And I think we\u2019re looking at about a thousand mixers out there now, and next year will be 10 years, 10 years of making them.\nWow, that\u2019s great. I think we only have time for one more question, so I'll keep it pretty simple. What have you been listening to lately? Any records you wanna shout?\nYeah. So I\u2019ve been listening, I\u2019ll just show you this one actually, I\u2019ve been listening to this. This new Emanative LP that just dropped about a month ago, that\u2019s been brilliant. It\u2019s pretty jazzy, pretty laid back.\nAnd apart from that, I\u2019ve been buying a lot of older used reggae. And I just got the reissue of this African Head Charge album.\nWe're all about the On-U over here.\nYeah, like all the On-U I\u2019m working my way through it. And I also like this, album here. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve got it, you might have.Oh yeah, the new Time Capsule.Yeah, Gabrielle Roth & the Mirrors. That\u2019s beautifully recorded too. I love the sound of that.\nAnd apart from that, I\u2019ve been buying obscure bits of house music from the late eighties and nineties. Not necessarily even expensive bits, but just bits that have been sort of catching my ear and \u201cI need a copy of that.\u201d Some early British bits and pieces too. At some point I\u2019m going to put a brit funk mix together. I\u2019ve been promising my friend I\u2019ll be doing it. And I\u2019ve been, building the pile up, just stuff that sounded pretty funky and loose that started from about 78 to about 83, 1983. There was this burst of really nice jazz-funk and brit-funk. And then it sort of just disappeared as drum machines came in. So yeah, I\u2019m working on compiling this mix.Excited to hear it.\nLearn more about Condesa here:https://condesaelectronics.com/\nFollow Condesa:https://www.instagram.com/condesaelectronics/"

        "content": "When Lou Ottens, who invented the cassette tape, died in March, a host of stories celebrated the life of a man who upended the music business. Ottens\u2019 device wasn\u2019t the first to capture soundwaves onto magnetic tape, but his machine checked all the boxes for what the public wanted: portability, durability and recordability. It didn\u2019t skip when you hit a bump, you could toss it in your backseat without scratching it and \u2014 most important \u2014 you could record your own music onto it.\nIts creeping success starting in the 1960s moved into the mainstream in the early 1970s. Reel-to-reel tapes were already a key component in most respectable hi-fi systems at the time, and Ottens\u2019 invention was basically a reel-to-reel \u2014 but miniaturized and encased in plastic. A similar format, the 8-track tape, was making inroads but its shortcomings were obvious. It was\u00a0 hard to record onto and longer songs were interrupted by loud clicks as the recording switched from one to length of looped tape to another.\nAudiophile magazines and their illustrators embraced the audio cassette revolution. But, then, why wouldn\u2019t they? Major manufacturers had tape decks to sell, and to do so they needed to market the nascent technology. Add in that blank tape manufacturers such as TDK, BASF and Maxell were also eager to tap the audiophile community, and an advertising boom commenced. That boom resulted in competition among various tape-driven components.\nWith tape culture continuing its decade-long renaissance, we figured we\u2019d highlight a few ads and illustrations that drove the first wave of the format.\nFew ads are as iconic as this one for Maxell tapes. \u201cSome tapes show their age more than others. And when a tape ages prematurely, the music on it does too,\u201d reads the text below this two-page spread. The problem? Poor oxide particle binding. Maxell found a solution: \u201cEven after a Maxell recording is 500 plays old, you\u2019ll swear it\u2019s not a play over five.\u201d That\u2019s impressive, yes, but more impressive is that Maxells will blow you away like this guy in chair getting pushed by\u00a0 soundwaves.\nTwo simple circles and eye-popping green ink make this ad for a 1970 National Electronics Week trade show in Chicago worthy of framing.\nAt first it\u2019s tough to parse this illustration by the impossible-to-research artist named Cork. Published in the 1970 issue of Tape Recorder magazine, your perception shifts once you realize the machine is an upside-down phono cartridge, and the guy is meant to be projecting music onto tape.\nA sound so real you\u2019d swear there was a five-piece band in your mid-1970s bedroom every time you pop a BASF into your dinky player.\nThe implication of this ad is obvious: Why interrupt a make-out session to flip your Dan Fogelberg album 20 minutes in when an Akai cassette deck can play tapes that last 45 minutes per side? Enjoy your sex for at least 25 more minutes, basically \u2014 and even more if you\u2019ve got autoplay. The Japanese company Akai was a leader in tape deck components, and a few of their models from the 1970s remain in demand.\nThis illustration from a 1971 stereo buyers guide captures that moment when cassette decks, reel-to-reel players and 8-track tapes were all vying for a spot in your component chain.\nThis 1971 ad for BASF tape is simple and effective: flowers, first love, birds, stars, sunshine, two-toned rainbows and \u2026 tape.\nA classic and professional advertisement for TDK, which competed with Maxell for market dominance throughout the cassette era. Note: This was published during the Watergate era, when the discussion of taping systems in Richard Nixon\u2019s White House was part of the national dialogue."

        "content": "If you were lucky enough to be a music freak who could also illustrate, in the 1960s and \u201870s you could actually earn a living from working the hi-fi magazine circuit. After all, there are only so many ways to photograph a Marantz, McIntosh or JBL component, and with advertising money pouring in art budgets were fat.\nBecause of the nature of advertising and magazine work, the names of many of these for-hire illustrators have been lost to time, but their loving, occasionally cheeky depictions of gear and the listeners getting lost within it endure.\nBelow, a few illustration highlights from Stereophile, High Fidelity and other glossy magazines of the era.\nTaken from a 1977 advertisement for Pickering cartridges and styli, this illustration identifies \u201cStylus Carnivorous,\u201d a pest that \u201cmay look cute but he\u2019s a nasty little creature. He shows up when the stylus in your phonograph begins to wear.\u201d\nThe early 1970s saw the arrival of the first successful mass-market format since the LP: the cassette. Before its adaptation by component makers, cruising music was dictated by radio DJs. Cassettes changed the game, and the result was a huge push in the marketplace.\nOne of the major innovations of the golden hi-fi era was in stereo separation and amplification. Hellbent on exploring the capacities and engineering potential of room-filling sound, writers reported on innovations \u2014 and illustrators tried to capture ways of manifesting those ideas.\nMixing photos and illustrations, Harman Kardon\u2019s 1977 ad for its straight line tracking turntable the ST7 explains through similar images why the technology was deemed superior when it was introduced. The market spoke, however: few manufacturers make linear tracking turntables anymore.\nIf you look closely at the cover to this primer on hi-fi, you can see the canvas upon which the anonymous illustrator painted the original. With bold colors and a simple, brilliantly conveyed idea, the image pops off the page.\nBy the mid \u201870s, Marantz was so successful that they could apparently commission artists to drop a lot of acid, put on some tunes and start painting. This 1975 ad compares its competitors\u2019 flat sound to Marantz\u2019s more hallucinogenic energy.\nWho is this man, and why does he look like he\u2019s getting ready to go bartend at a saloon? Why isn\u2019t he sitting in front of the speakers? Whoever he is \u2014 and where are the speaker wires? \u2014 the ad campaign didn\u2019t hurt. Frazier Inc. is still in business making boutique speakers, part of Mitchell Acoustic Research."

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/thorens-td-160/",
        "content": "The famed Thorens TD-160 is pretty much unparalleled when it comes to classic vintage turntables models. The Swiss clock company first launched its phonograph division back in 1903 when much of the world didn\u2019t even know what a turntable was. That changed in 1928 when Thorens produced their first electric (motor-driven) record player and quickly became one of the most heralded phonograph machine manufacturers in the world.\nHoning their craft over the years, the company went on to develop an entire range of audiophile record players in the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s. In 1965, building on the suspension chassis design of Acoustic Research\u2019s XA model, they created their first suspended table, the Thorens TD-150. The entry level TD-160 would be introduced in 1972 and go on to become the company\u2019s most popular seller, with its manufacturing and production continuing pretty much nonstop for the next two decades. It was the apex of the 1970\u2019s hi-fi boom and there was no shortage in demand for these specialized audiophile units.\nBeing at the right place and time may have helped Thorens make its mark in the audio fidelity world, but this relatively affordable and well appointed turntable has since become a thing of legend. Considered by many the gold standard by which other turntables are judged, the TD-160 has endured.\nThe good news? Because so many were made back in the day, anyone looking to find a working model or parts for one will have little trouble finding one on the aftermarket.\nA lot of thought went into the stability within the design of this machine, making it an exceptionally quiet playing unit. At the basic level, the TD-160 is in fact a minimal yet stylistically handsome record playing machine. With its sturdy (usually) wooden-framed plinth and stance, it exudes stability and commands respect as part of any hi-fi set up based on its aesthetics alone.\nSimple in theory but technical in its construction, the Thorens TD-160 is a belt driven turntable with a floating sub-chassis suspended by three adjustable springs. The sub-chassis carry the main bearing via a mounting platform for its pickup arm. Which means that the turntable platter and arm are both rigidly coupled to a common sprung chassis, making them entirely independent of the plinth. When adjusted correctly, this innovative design ensures exceptional isolation from feedback and plays a vital role in the fidelity of the deck.\nThe sub-chassis and suspension construction allows a lower center of gravity, and because the mass stabilization of the sub-chassis and outer frame are so well balanced, the entire system is untethered from almost anything that might make noise and vibrations. The build quality on these things is fantastic. If properly maintained and cared for, a Thorens can last a lifetime or two of pure listening enjoyment.\nTo this day, the Thorens TD-160 is the deck of choice for turnable enthusiasts who are seeking a collectable piece of audiophile history that will provide amazing sound quality from a solidly made unit built to last.\nAnd make no mistake, it is a superb turntable in its stock format. But what really drives people to the TD-160 is its ability to be modified, improved and adjusted.\nIf trying out a new tone arm (straight or curved) for more sensitive tracking is your thing, have at it. The suspension springs can be entirely switched out or merely leveled on the TD-160, making for an overall smoother vibration dampening dynamic. Leveling a turntable is also crucial. An evenly leveled turntable has as much influence over the sound performance of your unit as any of its individual parts. Some ambitious audiophilers have even been known to change out the entire motor system within the machine to achieve a quieter running performance.\nOne of the most common modifications is building a custom plinth, the foundation of the turntable, which serves to improve isolation as well as the aesthetics of the turntable. Another common mod is, of course, replacing or switching between cartridge headshells or styli. Whether it be a moving magnet (MM), moving coil MC or a mono cartridge, swapping out can be quite easily achieved for an improved \u2014 or just different \u2014 sound dynamic.\nThe internet is dense with information, manuals and step by step instructions; with a little (or, okay, a lot) of patience, you can learn how to make these tweaks yourself. Whether you want to simply change the belt on your platter to keep consistent rotation speed or change out the unit\u2019s entire plinth, you can do it with the Thorens.\nhttp://www.thorens.com\nhttp://www.qaudio.comhas genuine Thorens replacement belts with the Thorens Logo.\nhttp://electricwarriorturntables.com/buying-a-thorens-td-160/Great resource on what you should know before buying a Thorens TD-160.\nhttp://www.analogue-classics.com/English language site, written by Holger Trass in Germany, with info on many collectible Thorens turntables.

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/japanese-portable-record-players/",
        "content": "Portable technology has always been an essential part of humanity. Whether a stone tool or\u00a0cellular phone, there\u2019s an undeniable enjoyment that comes with being able to carry your favorite device anywhere. Vinyl is no exception. When it became possible to have a recorded copy of your favorite song, it was only a matter of time before engineers and designers created\u00a0record players as easy to carry around as the records themselves.\nManufacturers in Japan including Toshiba, Columbia and Takt led the way with an array of designs in the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s to accompany this novel new phenomenon. Collector Fumihito Taguchi recently helped preserve and share these marvels of design by showcasing more than a hundred portable Japanese made players in anexhibit and bookreleased last year. This selection of players brings together a few found in thebookplus a few other noteworthy favorites.\nTakt brand record players were made by Tomikura Electric, and these turntables come in some of the most impressive colors and minimalist designs. The TP-880 had a stunning walnut trim and was Tact\u2019s premium player. This solid state machine had AM radio and a sleek look that was less playful than other models they carried. The tone arm nests in a concave nook and is held down by tension clasp that protects your needle. The cover for this one isn\u2019t shown here, but it\u2019s transparent, which means the design is always in view.\nThe TP-5 plays both 7-inch and 12-inch records. Its simple lines and bold use of colors runs through many of the company\u2019s other models. The speakers are comparable to other mid-range portable players, and the video just below demonstrates what it sounds like.\nThis tiny ultra portable turntable could almost fit in a back pocket, and most definitely in a school bag for recess time jams. The tone arm is on a spring that can be pushed flush with the body of the unit, and the metal speaker grill makes this model small and durable.\nThis stunning player integrates a 23 key electric piano that\u2019s perfect for playing along to your favorite tune. It plays both 7-inch and 12-inch records, and has a speaker that\u2019s small but mighty.\nThis player has a beautiful perforated metal grate for the speaker that would look great poolside. You can easily switch to AM radio or, if you need a bit more oomph, connect it to your favorite pair of speakers.\nOn this three-piece set-up, you can sequence your favorite tracks without the threat of the dead air that happens when flipping over a record. It even features a pitch fader for the aspiring picnic DJ. It can fit both 7-inch and 12-inch vinyl comfortably and the platter automatically spins when the tone arm is lifted. The audio quality is impressively solid for a small player, as evidenced in the video below.\nThis Columbia model is perfect for those who have a mix of tapes in their music collection. A hearty three-speed player accommodates 7-inch, 10-inch and 12-inch records, its larger profile houses a powerful speaker. It was made as a light standalone media player and has a suitcase handle for maximum utility.\nLeave it to the 80\u2019s to turn convention on its head with these vertically playing turntables. Out of any of the players on this list, this without a doubt has the best functional design for spinning, but it\u2019s also the only one without a speaker attached. It seems to have been designed so it looks like it would digitally read the record, but this is a fully analog device with a linear tracking needle similar to your average horizontal player. The body of the device is about the size of a VHS. But perhaps the best feature of these players are the matching booming speakers that were sold separately. You can listen to these unique objects via the video below.\nThe KP-747F is definitely for a more sophisticated bunch. It\u2019s the only portable player on the list that allows for tone adjustment and it\u2019s also the lone player that can play FM radio. It plays all three standard speeds and has a metal encasement that makes this one perfect for camping or any activity that would require extra durability.\nThe GP-55 was more of a toy for children, and it sports many of the standard features of the other players such as AM radio and basic speed adjustments.\nThis tiny player is meant for an equally tiny human, and this toy machine could play 7-inch and 12-inch records. The sound wouldn\u2019t be exactly satisfying to a music lover, though if you\u2019re a child you couldn\u2019t start playing vinyl on anything more adorable. We call this one \u201cBaby\u2019s first record player.\u201d"

        "content": "Fifty years ago when magazines were the dominant source of information on listening and hi-fi culture, the demand for the latest news on gear, technology and advances in stereophonic sound reproduction sparked fierce competition among publishers looking to connect advertisers with buyers.\nMagazines including Audio, Stereophile and High Fidelity targeted a generation with disposable income and a fierce love of listening to music. Dense with brands promoting then-fresh, covetable gear that a half-century later inspires both wonder and desire, the publications employed full-time reporters, editors, designers and illustrators whose monthly mission was to enlighten the massive American middle class on the wonders of stereophonic listening.\nThough they didn\u2019t realize it would at the time, this writing and these ads on the ins and outs of high-fidelity remain an incredible resource to those curious about the history of the technology driving quality sound.\nBelow, some choice advertisements from the peak hi-fi era.\nWhat kind of people don\u2019t use a Marantz in their system? \u201cBlah people. Middle-of-the-road-people who only listen to the midrange because their power amplifier DISTORTS the high and low frequencies,\u201d that\u2019s who. Judging by the volume of ads that the company placed throughout the 1970s, Marantz\u2019s campaigns worked. Hundreds of thousands of various models were sold, which is why so many remain in circulation.\nHere\u2019s a tip from a smart commenter on the Klipsch website re: securing a secondhand pair of\u00a0 Belle Klipsch speakers: \u201cIf you live near a college campus, knock on fraternity doors and ask, \u2018Do you have any old house speakers sitting in the basement?\u2019 Back in the \u201870\u2019s these things were favorite party speakers in fraternity houses from coast to coast, usually in unfinished oak veneer cabinets. Even if the cabinets are soaked in 40 years of spilled beer & barf, they are worth owning. Rescue them! Refinish them and put them in your audio room.\u201d\nThe early 1970s saw manufacturers bet big on cassette technology. Unlike the front-loaded components that became standard in the 1980s, most decks from the 1960s and \u201870s are designed to be top-loaded. This ad references the noise-reduction technology Dolby, a patented process that eliminates high-end hiss \u2014 but also reduces detail.\nThese little JBL beasts cost $300 new and on the used market now go for three times that. Gorgeous and powerful \u2014 \u201cTwo Lancer 55s and your 10-watt amplifier can get you evicted,\u201d the ad boasts \u2014 the speaker was designed with a smoked glass top, a hand-rubbed, oiled walnut finish and three color options for the speaker fabric.\nNot only is Garrard considered the most desirable turntable brand, their ads were miniature lectures on achieving quality sound. Read the text and tell us you don\u2019t want to dip into your savings and splurge.\nNeed graphics ideas? Glossy stereo magazines hired fantastic print designers and illustrators. Here\u2019s one example as a teaser to a future post on hi-fi graphics."

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/solid-state-vs-tube/",
        "content": "When committing to hi-fi audio gear you\u2019re going to have a lot of choices, and among the most crucial is whether you\u2019ll be looking for a tube or solid state amplifier.\nFor decades, this enduring debate within the audiophile community has divided fanatics into two camps. As with all aesthetic arguments \u2014 Beatles vs. Stones? Biggie or Tupac? \u2014 ultimately it comes down to taste as to whether tube amps or solid state/transistor amps offer a more precise document of the studio session. Both approaches generate a similar result: quality audio reproduction. But they do sound different.\nDeclaring, as many gearheads do, that tube amps will bring you more joy is akin to arguing that a vinyl copy of a record will always sound better than a digital source. Anyone who\u2019s purchased a poorly mastered new release on wax knows that\u2019s not necessarily the case. At best, vinyl delivers a depth and sonic richness that CDs don\u2019t\u00a0 attain. But lossless digital files can sound more accurate and, when remastered correctly, more precise than a record. Comparing solid state and tube amplification prompts similar conversations.\nAs a way to help you make more informed decisions, what follows is a primer on the differences between tube and solid state amps.\nWhen comparing the sound of tube versus solid state amplifiers, take into consideration that these machines work in different ways to generate their sound output. Solid State amps are driven by current throughout the output\u2019s devices. They typically have only one power transformer, and utilize silicon with current.\nTube amps, by contrast, are driven by voltage and as such need output transformers. If you\u2019re looking at, for example, a Luxman- SQ-N150 integrated tube amp, these transformers are the three large, heavy, black square-looking objects located in the rear of a tube amp. They convert the voltage from the output tubes to current that runs through wires and into the speakers to create sound. The tube amp gets its power through glass vacuum tubes with voltage.\nSilicon transistor-based amplification technology has come a long way over the years. Listeners who prefer the sound of solid state often cite their \u2018clean,\u2019 more detailed sound. Solid state amps can be more robust, durable and power efficient than their tube counterparts. They tend to offer more watts-per-dollar, so to speak, and can pretty much blow tube equipment out of the listening room in terms of sheer power. Bass control, say proponents, is tighter and allows for faster gain control \u2014 which results in a more immediate punch and overall presence to the music.\nThe sound of music played through silicon transistors is crisp and technically more accurate. So much so in fact, that higher-end solid state equipment will give you music replication playback that is as close to original source as is possible, minus any sound coloration. And because the \u2018noise-floor\u2019 with transistors is close to nil at 0.005hd (harmonic distortion), they provide an almost distortionless listening experience. This is one reason why electronic and classical music enthusiasts often prefer solid state over tubes.\nIt doesn\u2019t hurt that you can get a lot of sound for your buck going the transistor amp route these days; they\u2019re a great option for the audiophile on a budget. That said, detractors argue that solid state sound can be sterile, brittle and even harsh compared to the warmth that tube amps can provide. This brittleness, critics say, can lead to sound clipping at high volumes and listening fatigue.\nSome find the transparency and accuracy of transistor amplification counter productive. Tube fans suggest that since many recordings aren\u2019t precisely engineered and mastered, allowing for a more forgiving and rounder sound can smooth out the music.\nVacuum tube amplification has been around for more than a century and is still regarded by many as the best way to achieve sound excellence. Also known as valve amps, fans argue that tube amps sound sweeter, with a warmer and smoother sound. They add more texture and realism to vocals and instruments and deliver a richer, fuller mid-range than traditional silicon transistors amps.\nTube enthusiasts cite the \u2018holographic effect\u2019 as a central draw. An apt description of holographic sound is to imagine yourself walking around the singer and having the ability to hear each performer individually as the music played \u2014 as well as the space between them. Every detail of the acoustic guitar and every snare hit creates its own bubble, resulting in more layered, virtually three-dimensional sound.\nIn addition to the organic natural sound that vacuum tubes deliver, tubes can be swapped out and customized to a listener\u2019s liking, a term known as \u2018tube rolling.\u2019 To achieve a desired feel tubes are replaced with warmer sounding, and sometimes larger, tubes of better quality. They\u2019re often imported from Japan or China, and the process can become an expensive hobby. But it\u2019s part of the fun for hi-fi enthusiasts and music professionals alike, many of whom are continually chasing the elusiveperfect soundfrom their systems.\nOne downside with tubes is that they can put off a slightly audible hum. At low volume this can add to the noise floor of your listening experience. But this minor harmonic distortion is easily combated by volume adjustment. And while tubes are held in very high regard, they are fragile music conduits not unlike lightbulbs. They can burn out or even break, and need to be replaced from time to time.\nStill, most tubes will play for more than 10,000 hours (about 10 years) without any trouble at all. They do \u2018run hot\u2019 at times and can even heat up a room once in a while \u2014 a nice bonus for a frigid day \u2014 but keep the small children and house pets away. That said, most quality tube amps are encased in a cage that covers up and protects the valves.\nAre you a tube person or a solid state person? To figure it out, determine the sound you\u2019re seeking based on listening habits and what kind of music you like. Do your research. Test and demo equipment when possible and always ask questions. Countless resources are available online and any reputable specialist at an audio retailer should be able to guide you.\nIn the end, all that matters is connecting as closely as possible to the music itself and building a relationship with the art \u2014 whatever the engine that drove us there.\nReisong- A12 Integrated Vacuum Tube Amplifier \u2013 $500.00\nA relaxed sounding entry-level tube amp that will bring excellent midrange and transparent depth to your listening experience.\nLine Magnetic 34IA- Integrated Tube Amplifier- $1999.00\nThis handmade, push-pull tube-integrated amplifier employs point-to-point wiring and high quality capacitors to deliver dynamic natural sound.

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/oswalds-mill-audio-fleetwood-sound-company/",
        "content": "When Jonathan Weiss first laid eyes on the old stone Oswalds Mill building in the wilds outside of Allentown, Pennsylvania in New Tripoli, he knew it was the perfect location to create his dream sound factory. Built in the early 1800\u2019s, the loft-like, four-story open structure contained more than 10,000 square feet of workspace and had thick stone walls.\nThere were no immediate neighbors, so the spot was secluded enough to make as much noise as he would need to set up shop. So after buying the building in 1998, Oswalds Mill Audio (OMA) was born. Weiss wasn\u2019t setting out to construct just another stereo equipment factory. Instead, this would become his high fidelity sound laboratory \u2014 the Willy Wonka\u2019s Chocolate Factory of stereophonic sound design and manufacturing.\nHis mantra?\u00a0 \u201cMusic is an event, not a soundtrack.\u201d And at ISC Hi-Fi, we couldn\u2019t agree more.\nBridging vintage audio technology with the latest engineering techniques, Weiss relied on his own sound philosophy of old world craftsmanship to realize his innovative high end audio speakers, amplifiers, turntables and stereo furniture. Many characteristics set OMA apart from other brands making state-of-the-art audio gear today, but what makes this brand special is the outstanding acoustic performance of their uniquely designed cone-shaped horn speakers.\nUsing a special process, OMA thermally changes the nature of their wood by roasting it \u2014 akin to making coffee beans. This heat exposure changes the chemical structure and organic properties of the wood, making it more stable and a better conduit for the sound waves traveling out of it. Weiss\u2019 design features \u201cconical horns with straight walls\u201d which allows soundwaves to travel directly to the listener (as opposed to conventionally-designed curved tube speakers that dissipate sound). This innovation minimizes distortion and allows for a more accurate, uncolored soundfield.\nThe directivity of the horn is also crucial: there\u2019s no encumbrance when waves exit the driver. With less constriction, the speakers are far more efficient. Weiss likens this effect to a megaphone.\n\u201cThe conical shape allows the sound to go where you want it to go, and you don\u2019t have to shout. With a box speaker design you will have to shout or, put another way, crank the volume up unnecessarily. It\u2019s all about efficiency,\u201d he says.\nThe details are fantastic. OMA\u2019s are ported two different ways: from underneath or the front. This allows the listener to be able to virtually place the speakers anywhere. Sure, every room has different dimensional configurations, which will inevitably result in acoustic challenges. But it\u2019s nice to know that wherever you put these speakers you\u2019ll be pleased with how they sound.\nWeiss\u2019 passion stems from his time spent working at a theater when he was 14. He could never get over the sound emanating from the 2-meter-tall, horn-loaded Altec loudpeakers, which were\u00a0 powered by vintage tube amplifiers that projected sound over the cavernous auditorium. There was a directness and purity to it, he told me.\nVolume seemed to completely envelope the theater. Because the horn-loaded speakers channelled the sound in a particular direction with force but minus strain, its presence was unlike anything he had ever heard before.\n\u201cPeople not only forgot what great sound reproduction sounded like, but even to this day most have never even heard it,\u201d he said. Weiss set out to advance sound reproduction while drawing on his own past and designed his own version of a speaker with cone-shaped horn tweeters.\n\u201cUltimately, it\u2019s about harmonic resonance,\u201d he added, and the wooden horns have everything to do with creating that.\nWhile this company is clearly Weiss\u2019 vision, he had the wisdom to hire acoustical engineer Bill Woods, a renowned expert in horn amplification who had already been engineering\u00a0 loudspeakers for more than 35 years. Industrial designer David D\u2019Imperio was tasked with creating a design aesthetic \u2014 while maintaining the strict parameters of acoustic integrity. With an ample supply of sustainable ash and walnut in the surrounding Pennsylvania forestland, Weiss enlisted a few local master wood craftsmen from the nearby Knoll furniture factory.\nAcross the board, the bespoke nature of these individually handcrafted speakers make them\u00a0works of art. They\u2019re also some of the best sounding speakers money can buy. The company\u2019s Imperia model cost about as much as a really nice sports car.\nIt\u2019s true: the OMA line may not be within reach for every budget. That said, the company has recently created a sister company, Fleetwood Sound Co., that produces a DeVille speaker with the same build quality and sound philosophy, but at a much more accessible price point, relatively speaking: depending on the finish (check the finishes here), price ranges from $9,600 to $18,600.\nhttps://oswaldsmillaudio.com\nhttps://fleetwoodsound.com"

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/cartridges-uncovered/",
        "content": "When considering the sound performance of your stereo system, the stylus needle, otherwise known as the phono cartridge, is the only part of your audio set-up that will make physical contact with your records. For this reason alone, it\u2019s crucial to consider the cartridge on your turntable the most integral factor in the overall equation of achieving hi-fidelity greatness from your records.\nBy exploring some of the basic mechanics of these miniature sound emitting devices, we\u2019ll attempt to explain some of the myths and misconceptions about phono cartridges. Hopefully this will give you a better overall understanding of what the remarkable devices actually do. We\u2019ll also compare the two primary types of phono cartridges, moving magnet (MM) and moving coil (MC), and contrast the performance between models.\nThe phono cartridge is a complex electro-mechanical device that sits at the end of the tonearm and holds the stylus in place. It converts the physical movement of the stylus into electrical signals to pass on to the pre-amplifier.\nResponse range, clarity on musical peaks, tonal balance, stereo separation and imaging, along with freedom from noise and distortion, are all affected by the phono cartridge. As you move up to higher performance models, the diamond shape of the needle attached to the cartridge itself actually changes to afford increased contact area deeper within the grooves. While we are talking about fractions of milligrams here, those smaller details and that information within the grooves are there for the amplifying, so why wouldn\u2019t you try to?\nAn upgraded stylus can further articulate what you hear and just how incredible a particular pressing of record truly is. Notes bite through with a more pronounced feel. Perhaps even more important, cartridges strongly affect the life of your records. With rarities becoming more and more difficult to replace, it\u2019s an important point to keep in mind.\nThe stylus or \u2018needle\u2019 is the small pointed piece on the end of the cartridge that makes direct contact with your record and tracks the indentations and imprinted \u2018sound waves\u2019 in the record\u2019s grooves. Styli are usually made of diamond but sometimes sapphire, with lower quality needles being \u201cdiamond-tipped\u201d and higher quality pieces being all diamond (also called \u2018nude diamond\u2019).\nThe ideal is having a diamond shaped as closely as possible to the original cutting stylus. In order of quality, expense and ability to pick up detail, styli will usually be shaped as conical (spherical), elliptical, hyperelliptical (fine line), or micro-ridge. Stylus shapes and manufacturing quality vary widely, and can range in price from $15 to more than $30,000.00\nThere are two main types of phono cartridges, moving-magnet (MM) and moving-coil (MC). These two designs are crafted and constructed differently and their performance can vary dramatically.\nMoving Magnet (MM)\nMM cartridges convert vibrations into audio signals by having a magnet attached to the cantilever, which then vibrates in close proximity to a pair of coiled wires. When the tiny magnets positioned between the two coils are activated, they produce a small electrical current. With a MM cartridge, the magnet vibrates and the coils do not.\nWhile the engineering and physics with both types or cartridges are quite technical, the basic deal is that MM cartridges are significantly easier to make but less sensitive and deliver a less accurate signal. There\u2019s a good chance that if you own an entry level turntable you have MM cartridge on your player. The good news is that MM cartridges are more forgiving and versatile and are compatible with more turntables and external phono preamps. MM are also much easier to replace in case of damage.\nMoving Coil (MC)\nA MC cartridge does the opposite, mechanically, to what an MM does. The coils move and the magnet does not. With an MC, the coil wires are attached to the vibrating cantilever, which then vibrates a fixed magnet. MC cartridges, while far more finicky, are the \u2018go to\u2019 choice for listeners willing to stop at nothing in the pursuit of the best playback quality. Moving coils deliver an accuracy the MM cartridges simply cannot.\nThese devices are painstakingly built by hand and rarely, if ever, mass produced. This precision handcrafting requires a skilled technician, using a microscope, to wind a precise number of coils.\u00a0 Every cartridge is then run through a gamut of performance tests before it leaves the factory. All this significantly drives up the manufacturing cost. But if you have audiophile aspirations and are looking for the best sound possible from your turntable, a MC Cartridge is for you.\nA high output MC cartridge achieves its increased output by including more turns of wire in the coil, and with more turns you\u2019ll get more voltage. The cartridge uses more wire attached to the cantilever as a way to increase inertia. For superior performance, you need to properly track the high frequencies, which change the direction of the needle thousands of times per second. You might also need a more sensitive phono preamp to fully tap the potential. Predictably, all of this is more expensive. But it gives you the absolute best performance.\nStill, in most cases, lower output MM cartridges are more favorable as they require fewer turns of wire and are generally considered to give a more consistent sound quality. They\u2019re also likely to be cheaper and easier to work with.\nLet\u2019s repeat this for emphasis: The performance potential of your turntable is most defined by the capabilities of the phono cartridge. Response range, tonal balance, clarity on musical peaks, stereo separation and imaging, and freedom from noise and distortion \u2014\u00a0 all are affected by these diminutive devices. Cartridges fitted to most common turntables should serve you well in general, but if you\u2019re looking for a quick way to upgrade your vinyl listening experience, upgrading your phone cartridge is a great place to start.\nBelow we\u2019ve included a list of cartridges that we recommend across all price levels.\nOrtofon 2M Blue \u2013 (MM) $225\nA definite step up from the Ortofon 2M Red in terms of its sound sensitivity. Adds more dynamics and resolution and has a more \u201copen\u201d sound. It\u2019s also a great value for the money.\nDenon DL-103 (MC) Cartridge $299\nDenon\u2019s basic 103 is excellent value and possibly the best cartridge you can get at this price point. Sounding very smooth and musical, it delivers a classic \u201cold fashioned\u201d sound (in the best way).\nMoFi Electronics \u2013 UltraTracker (MM) $499\nThis high-output MM uses the same layout as the cutting head responsible for making the grooves on MoFi records. The physical configuration is hand built in Japan and extracts immense amount of detail, dynamics, tone and texture from LP\u2019s.\nGrado Sonata 2 Low Output (MC) $600\nA wood chassis cartridge with optimized mass distribution designed for improved audio stability\u00a0and imaging. For the discriminating listener.\nClear Audio Artist V2 Ebony (MM) $650\nA high output cartridge with a ton of dynamic range and a super balanced response.\nHANA- SL Shibata Cartridge \u2013 Low Output (MC)\u00a0$750.00\nA brilliant and gorgeous sounding Japanese cartridge. The Hana brand is known for its supreme transparency and excellent trackability.\nNagaoka MP-500 (MM) $950\nAnother Japanese-made favorite. One of Stereophile\u2019s \u201ceditor\u2019s top picks,\u201d the Nagaoka MP-500 offers the highest musical and creative expression of the brand\u2019s new MP series. It expertly extracts and reproduces with vivid, colorful and dimensional clarity what others miss.\nEMT TSD 15\u00a0(MC) ~ $1500\nThe cornerstone of the celebrated German EMT line, the TSD 15 has been used in recording studios and radio stations throughout Europe for over 50 years. The TSD 15 delivers with robustness and equal parts finesse and resolution coupled to excellent dynamics, a truly fast delivery of the notes and a \u2018live\u2019 character.\nSoundsmith \u2013 The Voice Ebony MI(Moving Iron)\u2013 High Output \u00a0$3000\nA high-output moving coil cartridge, the Voice Ebony from Soundsmith is faster, smoother and more sonically enhanced than almost anything out there. Recognized industry-wide, it\u2019s won numerous hi-fi product-of-the-year trophies for this unparalleled sound performance."

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/mid-century-hifi-designs/",
        "content": "Aiming to add simplicity to our lives by shunning maximalism, mid-century designers experimented with the concept of \u201cform follows function\u201d in almost every aspect of the design of daily life. It\u2019s no surprise that many venerated mid-century architects and designers got in on reimagining what at-home listening could look like. Notable names like Charles and Ray Eames, Dieter Rams\u00a0and Franco Albini, all explored hi-fi design with stunning results. Below we\u2019ve included a list of seven mid-century designs that may change how you think of the physical instruments behind deep listening.\nHusband and wife team Charles and Ray Eames are perhaps the most famous for their signature chairs, and in 1956 Stephens Tru-sonic asked the Eames office to redesign a series of speaker enclosures. Naturally, they\u00a0 employed design elements they favored, including the curved radial design they used for their iconic lounge chair. The team centered their designs on the people they were meant for, with curved corners to prevent injury during the day-to-day at home. The circular plastic grill cover was envisioned to replace cloth covers, which collected dust and were difficult to clean. This Is why their friend, architect Bill Lacey would say, \u201cThere is no Eames style, there is just a legacy problem beautifully solved.\u201d\nDieter Rams shaped the design of the German appliance company Braun via\u00a0 his steadfast philosophy, \u201cweniger, aber besser\u201d which translates as \u201cless, but better.\u201d And Rams\u2019 work still greatly influences contemporary companies like Apple because of his specific focus on consumer goods. As head of design at Braun for over 30 years, Rams elegantly designed everything from toasters to record players. When Rams took on hi-fi equipment, he wanted the visual language to speak to the clarity of sound. The Braun LE-1 in 1959 was the first electrostatic mode loudspeaker available on the German hi-fi market, and the wide span and slim profile was meant to symbolize the clarity of its sound. It was set on a stand that was at a tilt, which enabled home users to maximize the sonic profile of the unit. It was the first speaker that was raised on a thin metal base, which was meant to make the speaker appear to almost float.\nThe next speaker, the L-2, looked like Rams\u2019 take on the Eames design. It was also typified by starkfully minimalist design reminiscent of fine artists like Piet Modrian, who was also fascinated by simple geometric elements. Rams was on a continual search for universal values in aesthetics, which is perhaps why his work remains relevant more than 50 years later.\nThe classic JBL Paragon\u2019s production run was the longest of any of the company\u2019s speakers. Manufactured from 1957 to 1983 as the first mass-produced stereo loudspeaker for home use, and it was JBL\u2019s flagship product. It was also the most expensive speaker in the world at the time at\u00a0 $1,830, which, adjusted for inflation, equates to over $15,000 today. It\u2019s still highly sought after. One in decent shape goes for about $30,000 now.\nIts wooden sculptural shape was imagined by JBL industrial designer Arnold Wolf from a concept elaborated by electrical engineer Richard Ranger. One early issue of stereophonic sound was addressing that the stereo image \u2014 the direction sound travels in the room \u2014 only provided a single auditory sweet spot. The Paragon successfully mitigated this by reflecting the sound on curved wood surfaces. That, in turn, would refract the sound far more broadly into the room.\nIts stately design is still celebrated today and at nine feet wide, it is the centerpiece of any room it\u2019s in.\nThe stereo cabinet that Franco Albini designed for his own house was made as a pushback against the ordinariness of mass produced objects. The transparent enclosure is meant to symbolize it\u2019s separation from the physical world and spoke to the time it was produced in 1938, just a few years before the accepted start of the mid-century period. Italy was under the grip of the fascist prime minister Benito Mussolini and the country was trudging forward towards World War II. This was the first design of its kind, and is one of the most impressive designs by Albini.\nThe RR126 was one of the most famous designs in the history of Italian home stereo, and became a status symbol as soon as it was released in 1966. Its modular speakers could be hung on either side of the record player or disconnected to sit on the floor or any surface. Though it was beautifully symmetric, minimalism was not the factor that set the RR126 apart from the others on this list. Quite the opposite. This unit was anthropomorphized with volume dials for eyes and speakers for ears.\nThe stereo system is still being produced by Brionvega and all by hand, though the vintage units are more highly valued. That\u2019s no surprise; it\u2019ll make any room look like the set of a 60\u2019s italian thriller.\nOnly 400 Project G units were made between 1964-1967, and the brand quickly became a celebrity favorite. Frank Sinatra, Hugh Hefner, Oscar Peterson and others owned them, and consequently they popped up on the sets of movies including The Graduate, The Party and Zabriskie Point.\nIt was a breakthrough design that integrated traditional wooden encasements and saddled it with two omnidirectional speakers that look like futuristic orbs. Though everyone wanted one, the price made it relatively inaccessible. They retailed for $2,000 (about $20,000 in today\u2019s money).\nReleased in 1968, this high-end audio loudspeaker is unusual even compared to others on this list. It looks more like a screen door than an audio device. If you\u2019ve ever taken off the protective mesh screen of a speaker, you\u2019ll likely see a conical piece that drives the sound production. Mangepan instead opted for a flat planar driver system that was mounted on a panel, and since it didn\u2019t require depth of a cone, it dramatically reduced its profile.\nThe Mangepan MG-II was also bi-directional, with the back panels sending sound waves into the wall behind the unit, which would then reflect the sound into the room. Whether this innovation was effective is still debated, but with plenty of consumers who bought into the novelty, Mangepan units were plentiful so they\u2019re not hard to find."

        "content": "If you\u2019ve stepped into a reputable record store or stereo dealer in the past 30 years, you\u2019ve been around them. If anybody you know collects records, you\u2019ve seen them. If you have any audiophile friends, chances are you\u2019ve listened to a few. And if you are a music fanatic that cherishes amazing sound quality, then you most likely own a few of them yourself.\nWe\u2019re talking about Mobile Fidelity Original Master Series recordings. They\u2019re easily identified by the bold color strip running across the top of the album cover with italicized block letters reading ORIGINAL MASTER RECORDING.\nMobile Fidelity Sound Labs, known to collecting geeks as MoFi, has been putting out records since 1977, but the company was founded about a decade earlier by sound recording engineer Brad Miller. His passion at the time was for capturing what he called \u201cfield recordings.\u201d (This is where the \u201cM\u201d in \u201cMobile\u201d comes from.) With little more than a microphone and 8-track recorder in hand, starting in the 1960s Miller recorded the atmospheric sounds of thunderstorms, locomotive steam trains and other environmental utterances. Stereo sound recording was gaining popularity, and Miller realized that by panning his captured sounds left to right and combining them together, he was creating a sound field and depth not yet captured on record.\nAfter meeting up with fellow audio enthusiast and disc jockey Gary Geogi in Washington state, the two began collaborating on how to get stereo music recordings onto vinyl that sounded as good as Brad\u2019s field recordings. This research led them to Stan Ricker in Hollywood, who had been working on a \u201chalf speed mastering process.\u201d This process used the original master tape cut onto lacquer at half speed, which was then pressed onto Japanese virgin vinyl.\nThe marriage of this direct tape recording and record cutting capability, along with the Japanese vinyl, resulted in a winning combination. Soon thereafter, the Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs record label was born.\nSince 1977, MoFi has been putting out limited runs of these highly sought after hi-fidelity records, which music fans and collectors revere. The company has released more than 400 records to date, including stellar pressings of the Beatles\u2019 \u201cAbbey Road,\u201d \u201cLed Zeppelin II,\u201d the London Philharmonic\u2019s performance of Holst\u2019s \u201cThe Planets\u201d and Weezer\u2019s \u201cPinkerton.\u201d\nPredictably, some of these releases are long out of print and either impossible to find or very expensive. These days it\u2019s tough to find a copy of \u201cAbbey Road\u201d for less than $200 in good condition. If you do, consider yourself lucky, as many collectors consider it the best pressing of this record ever. That\u2019s no small boast: literally hundreds of pressings and remasters of \u201cAbbey Road\u201d are out there.\nMobile Fidelity\u2019s focus has always been on locating and sourcing the original master tapes for the company\u2019s remaster. The remastering process is the art of tapping those\u00a0 original masters to capture the most \u201clife-like\u201d picture of what the artist and producers were trying to attain. While this seems like a given, sourcing said analog masters can be an adventure unto itself for the company. It involves convincing the label and artist to green light the project and then locating the original master tapes.\nBecause a lot of these recordings were made decades ago, this can be an impossible process. Even when they\u2019re found, tapes might be incomplete, oxidized or damaged. If so, the project is scrapped. When masters are deemed worthy, engineers at MFSL work with precision audio pressing equipment so they can get the most from these tapes.\nThe so-called special sauce that makes MoFi records superior is the attention to detail at every turn. The magnetic master tapes are transferred with painstaking precision \u2014 without compression and minimal equalization \u2014 to create as close the exact representation of the music as possible. The vinyl they source, while no longer from Japan, is still 100% virgin and of a much higher density than your average mass market record.\nThis process, of course, is much more expensive, but the results are worth it. The sound floor is consistently quieter and the overall fidelity is virtually unbeatable.\nWith the vinyl market stronger than ever, MFSL continues to expand their catalog with monthly re-issues. The company has even created an ultra premium \u201csuper vinyl\u201d LP line. Called the Ultradisc One-Step Box Sets, these limited edition records are considered to be the highest quality pressing being made today. They are issued in series of 7500 units at a retail cost of $125.00 each \u2014 and sell out almost immediately. In a little more than five years, the after-market for these releases has gone crazy. Santana\u2019s \u201cAbraxas,\u201d if you are lucky enough to find one, will set you back in upwards of $2,000.\nWith the demand and its stellar reputation, the company has expanded operations to include listening accessories and equipment. Three years ago the company built their own factory, \u201cMOFI-Electronics,\u201d and started making their own hi-end audiophile cartridges and turntables. From what we\u2019ve been told, the gear, like the records themselves, are flying off the shelves.\nQuality, it seems, does matter."

        "content": "Maybe it\u2019s the nostalgia. Perhaps it\u2019s the distinctive stainless steel look, with its warm golden glow emanating from the lights within the interior chassis. For some, it could be the entry level price point that is so alluring about these beautiful sound machines. But for this writer, it\u2019s all of the above, and we haven\u2019t even begun to talk about how these things sound.\nBuilt and engineered like refined tanks in the golden age of stereophonic equipment in the mid 70\u2019s, Pioneer was regarded as the high water mark for both value and high fidelity performance. If Apple designed a stereo receiver, anything from the Pioneer SX Series in the 70\u2019s would be it!\nKnown for their elegance and tactility, the build quality and all materials, internal structure, and wood cabinet are topnotch. The dials and switches are beautifully machined and of an extraordinarily high quality. Not only is this a receiver that makes a statement in your listening room but it\u2019s a machine that you feel like you want to interact with.\nThe minimal design of these complex music conduits make operating the loudness, bass and treble and tone controls a pure pleasure. The smooth resistance of the tuning wheel and volume knob spin so effortlessly and with such a solid feeling, that they add extra authority to the user experience, making you feel as though you are practically engineering the music yourself.\nThe Pioneer industrial designers even compensated for the visual weight of the large tuner control dial by purposely placing the tuner signal and tuning meters off-center. A less thoughtful industrial designer would have placed the meters dead center, eliminating the complexity of the industrial design, but making it less engaging. All of the controls with these vintage Pioneer SX units have that uniquely satisfying firm push button feeling when engaged, and audible \u201cthunk\u201d when activated.\nIn the 70\u2019s advances in electronic componentry, such as the widespread availability and low cost of reliable silicon transistors, made the design and manufacture of receivers feasible and popular. By combining three components, the power amplifier, preamplifier and tuner onto a single chassis, using a single main power supply and only one cabinet, the integrated amplifier was born.\nPioneer was the pinnacle of this Hi-Fi industrial design in the 70\u2019s, but competition was getting fierce. Newcomers like Kenwood, Marantz, Yamaha, and Sansui gave Pioneer quite a run for their money. At one point there were even \u201cPower Wars\u201d to see who could \u201cout power\u201d who in pure wattage. Pioneer that would be the first company to break the 100WPC (watts per channel) barrier with their SX-1010. From here they would make their lauded SX-1250 model that would put out a whopping 160WPC, and then finally in 1979 they would conquer all with The SX-1980, packing in a massive 270WPC.\nThe SX-1250 and SX-1980 models are both incredibly powerful integrated amps that sound clear and detailed, but also have that warmth that vintage fans love. They sound great at all volumes\u00a0and you\u2019ll notice that the sound remains true and transparent throughout. Hook these receivers up to a good pair of large speakers and you can hear the power output in the quality of bass it can put out at high volumes.\nFrom entry level SX-450 thru to the SX-1250, these magnificent sounding stereo units, with all their charm and character, are surprisingly easy to find on the aftermarket. Whether at an online auction such as Ebay, a reputable online marketplace (Audiogone or US-Audiomart) or even at a thrift-shop, these are pretty easy to find in good condition and at a good price.\u00a0 As I write this story, I am listening to a Neil Young record through a Pioneer SX-550 that I recently acquired on eBay, and I can easily say, it was the best $300 I ever spent.\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "title": "In Conversation: A New Era of Audiophile Jazz with Blue Note\u2019s \u2018Tone Poet\u2019 Joe Harley",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/in-conversation-blue-note-joe-harley/",
        "content": "Blue Note\u2019s recent Tone Poet reissue series has stunned fans with picks from their historic catalog, which stretches back to 1939. The magician behind the revival and remastering of these original session tapes is the \u201cTone Poet\u201d himself, Joe Harley. Together he and his team have helped shepherd in a new age of jazz home listening.\nSurprisingly, this is the first \u201chi-fi\u201d project for Blue Note and they make the claim that you\u2019ll never get a better version \u2014 original pressing or otherwise. The aim of the series is to fully honor these sessions of well- and lesser-known artists, including Chick Corea, Hank Mobley and Donald Byrd, and to sonically bring fans into the studio.\nTo the delight of fans, Blue Note has just announced their releases for 2021-2022, the first of which comes out March 12th. It\u2019s from Charles Lloyd, who happens to be who gave Harley his now famous \u201cTone Poet\u201d nickname, and the namesake of the series. The full schedule of releases can be found at the end of this interview.\nWhat was your initial introduction to Blue Note?\nWell, I was a kid in Lincoln, Nebraska, not exactly a hotbed of jazz, but my mother listened to a lot of it at home. I got fascinated, particularly with the drummers, because I was playing drums as a little kid. And when I started to hear people like Philly Joe Jones and Art Blakey, it blew my mind because I didn\u2019t know what they were doing. But I learned. I went to the library and found some old Downbeat magazines and I started to look through them.\nWhen I was about 10, I rode my bicycle down to my local record store and started looking at the jazz section. And to this day, I still don\u2019t know how a store in Lincoln, Nebraska had original Blue Notes. We\u2019re talking 1961, but there they were. I don\u2019t remember the other titles, but they had Sonny Clark\u2019sCool Struttin, and I recognized the name of the drummer because I\u2019d seen his name in Downbeat, Philly Joe Jones. And then to be totally honest the cover was what really drew me in. I was old enough to know that cool was desirable, and so I thought, \u201cAll right, this looks fantastic, plus it\u2019s got those legs on the cover.\u201d And so I took my allowance money and bought the record and raced home on my bicycle; that was my first ever Blue Note record.\nI still remember looking at the logo with it\u2019s blue and white motif.\u00a0 I still remember staring at it thinking how cool it was. Then, when I put the record on, I was hooked. I sat there with my little Ludwig drum set and my headphones trying to play along with Philly Joe Jones. It wasn\u2019t pretty, let me tell you, but the hook was set and I couldn\u2019t get enough after that.\nI really love that story because you talk about the physicality of the record. It's not just a sound but it's the name of the players, it's the feeling of the sleeve; It's a visceral physical experience. I know that was also extremely important to you for the Tone Poet series, how did it fit into this project?\nThat\u2019s a great question. Before we started the programming for Tone Poet, Don Was, President of Blue Note, was very aware of its importance. I had started along with my friend, Ron Ronbock, to re-issue a Blue Note series for the label Music Matters. We did over a hundred titles and we made the decision very early on that we wanted to try to bring whoever bought those records into the event \u2014 give them an idea of what might it have been like to be there. So we did that by breaking the normal mold, which would be to do an exact copy of the original. The originals weren\u2019t gatefolds, by and large, and they didn\u2019t have session photos inside.\nWe knew there were photos by Francis Wolff, who was the other partner in Blue Note along with Alfred Lion. Those two guys founded Blue Note in 1939. Francis was an avid photographer, and lucky for us he took his Nikon camera to almost all the sessions and shot photos. So knowing that we could get a hold of all those photos, we made an arrangement where we could use them in our releases.\nI knew it\u2019d be successful, but did I understand the degree? No. People loved having something where they knew all aspects of the production were done as they should be.\nAnd as far as the presentation, we wanted them to be the best album jacket that could be made and present the music in a way that made it more of an event. The package was nice: the cardboard, the texture, you could feel their old style. They\u2019re called tip-on jackets and it\u2019s the way jackets used to be made. We put session photos on the inside of the gatefold and the specialness of that attention to detail reflected the attention paid to the mastering and all aspects of the production. It was evident from the minute you pick up the record that it was special.\nIt\u2019s incredible that this all happened before the Tone Poet Series. What was that first conversation like with Don Was when he introduced the concept to you?\nWell, Don and I were at EastWest Studios in Hollywood working with Charles Lloyd, a great artist. Don pulled me aside one day and said, \u201cI\u2019d really like to do something like what you and Ron are doing at Music Matters. I\u2019d like you to do it for us. Would you be interested?\u201d And my first thought was they\u2019d never do it because it\u2019s really expensive. You know, the jackets are expensive, the mastering, everything about it is a little more costly and consequently, you have to charge more. So I just figured it\u2019d be very short, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s a great idea, but here\u2019s what you\u2019re looking at,\u201d and that would be the end of it. I explained all that to him and he just got this great big grin and he went, \u201cFantastic.\u201d And so all my defenses were gone and I thought, \u201cWell, if you\u2019re down for that, then I\u2019m down, too.\u201d\nThe way we went, there was some planning and I had to come up with lists of titles. There were some new vendors that Blue Note had to start using and we had to establish those contacts. Anyway, all of that got done, and half a year or so later we were off and running.\nWhat was it like to walk into the Blue Note vaults with all of the master tapes for the first time?\nI get the shivers even thinking about it. You see all the history of jazz sitting there on those shelves. By that time we had done so many Blue Note reissues with Music Matters so I held a lot of those master tapes. But to see them in one spot is just an amazing thing; kind of overwhelming and emotional, in a great way.\nThis was the first HiFi project for Blue Note, so I\u2019m curious, how do you define the term \u201caudiophile\u201d?\nI think one way to look at it is a quest for perfection, which we can never quite attain. What I mean by that is, the word at its best is a desire to bring the studio or live performance into your listening room. In the case of a symphony, AC/DC, or Megadeth or something like that, could you really have that in your living room? Probably not. The authorities would probably show up at some point. But in the case of smaller-scale music like jazz, with the right gear you can come pretty close to recreating the event. Can you ever completely pull off the magic trick? No, and that\u2019s where some of the madness of it comes, because you can get closer and closer, but you never quite achieve a hologram.\nAlthough sonically, if your setup is correct you get what audiophiles referred to as \u201cstage imaging,\u201d If everything is placed properly, you get a complete sort of three-dimensional soundstage. If you listen in the dark or you close your eyes, it\u2019s awfully close and awfully compelling. That might be audiophilia at its best, and that desire at its worst. Sometimes it just becomes hardware worship. And I\u2019ve known audiophiles that have half-a-million dollar setup and 100 records that they play over and over and over again. So then it can become something more akin to listening to the gear rather than listening to the music. So you know there can be good parts to it, and parts that are maybe not quite so healthy, although nobody\u2019s we\u2019re not hurting anybody. There are worse addictions to have.\nWhat is your ideal home listening setup like in regards to gear?\nWell, the speakers I use are Vandersteen Model Sevens, the phono stage and preamp are from Audio Research and the amplifiers are the Ayre Acoustics MX-R power amplifier. The turntables are pretty wild. It\u2019s called the Transcendence and is made by Basis. This stuff is collectively pretty pricey, but the great thing about analog is you can spend a really modest amount of money and hear all the reasons why people get excited by analog.\nThere\u2019s a whole movement, which I know you guys are into, for vintage gear. You can get vintage gear that\u2019s affordable and incredible. You can spend a fortune or you can spend a little, but basically if it\u2019s totally honest and you set it up correctly in your room, I tell people, you can do alot with very little. One sort of handy rule of thumb for speaker setup is to think of it as you\u2019re sitting at the center of an equilateral triangle. You can\u2019t go too far wrong with that.\nMany of those million-dollar systems I wouldn\u2019t give you a nickel for. They can narrow what you want to hear until you can only really play 20 records because the rest of your records sound bad. So you end up not wanting to listen to them. I don\u2019t like gear like that. I want gear that makes me want to hear everything I\u2019ve got.\nI get the distinct impression that In Sheep\u2019s Clothing has a similar sort of view. That it\u2019s really about enjoyment and satisfying the soul and not just worship of gear.\nWas the Tone Poet series meant to be a long-term project? Were you surprised at the success?\nI\u2019ve never really asked Don Was and the others, but I got that impression. When we first started, we were going to try it and see and so initially we agreed to one year.\nAnd I know there were people within the organization that thought, \u201c$35 bucks, who\u2019s going to spend $35 bucks on an album? What, are you guys crazy?\u201d And so initially when we started, the numbers that were ordered from the pressing plant and from the printing company were pretty modest. And I remember when we released the first two records, I got a phone call from Justin Seltzer at Blue Note and he said, \u201cWell, we have a problem.\u201d And I thought, \u201cGosh, you know, first records out, and so I guess this is it. I guess something\u2019s really wrong\u201d. But then he continues with, \u201cYeah, we have a problem. We\u2019ve sold all the records and we haven\u2019t even shipped yet.\u201d\nHistorically though, Blue Note introduced so many things in the history of modern jazz. Like Thelonious Monk, his first records were for Blue Note. Nobody would touch him because he was considered commercially a non-entity\u2026 They knew it was important.\nAnd I thought, \u201cOh, well, that\u2019s a good problem to have. It\u2019s a problem, no doubt about it. It\u2019s better than nobody wants them\u201d. And so for a few release cycles, they kept increasing the numbers ordered and they were never enough. It was like they were kind of dipping their toe in and they kept selling out. It took six or seven months for everyone to kind of understand this is how these things are going to be received. We have an understanding on quantity now, but it\u2019s an ongoing challenge. We\u2019ve got our pressing plant almost maxed out.\nI knew it\u2019d be successful, but did I understand the degree? No. People loved having something where they knew all aspects of the production were done as they should be. In other words, they knew who mastered it, they knew that we were using the original masters and they knew that the presentation, in terms of packaging, was going to be as good as you can get.\nDo you feel like it\u2019s important for listeners to know the history of the original engineer, Rudy van Gelder? His mastering style was so unique.\nYeah,\u00a0I think one of the real important things to know is that in the heyday in the 1950/60s period of Blue Note, Rudy started working with the label, I believe, in 1953. But all throughout until maybe \u201868 or \u201869, Rudy was recording live to two-track. What that means is that you\u2019re mixing on the fly as that session is going down. It\u2019s really hard to do. There\u2019s no punch-in or fix it in the mix later. That\u2019s not possible when it\u2019s live to two tracks. The mix that he\u2019s doing, as the guys are playing is the mix you\u2019re going to get. That\u2019s what you work with.\nSo if Lee Morgan steps up to the microphone and he\u2019s a little close, there might be a little overload and you can hear Rudy diving for the fader to make his adjustment. If you\u2019re after multitrack precision and perfection, you\u2019re not going to get that with Rudy van Gelder recordings. He comes really close though. It\u2019s shocking how good he was, but to me, that\u2019s part of the excitement, too. You can hear him working to get it all in there and contain it.\nAnd there are Art Blakey sessions where Art comes thundering in on drums overloads the mics, and that\u2019s actually kind of exciting too. You hear Rudy trying his best to make his adjustments and it\u2019s all there on the master tape. So yeah, there have been times over the years where customers will say, \u201cOn track two side B, at two minutes and 31 seconds in, I hear what sounds like overload. Why didn\u2019t you guys fix that\u201d? Well, the answer is you can\u2019t. It\u2019s there on the tape. You can\u2019t go back in time and undo it. That\u2019s what\u2019s there. So that\u2019s part of the joy too, you know?\nIt seemed like it wasn't even a question that you would stick to an all-analog chain during the mastering process. Can you speak to that? Was there ever any sort of pull towards digital in any way, or was it a non-negotiable for you?\nYeah, non-negotiable. What\u2019s in the groove is literally the waveform. It\u2019s not ones and zeros it is the actual waveform. And when you hear music or you hear speech, the air gets excited by the event. I\u2019m making the air move a certain way and you can hear it. It\u2019s physical.\nWith the LP playback system, it\u2019s remarkable that it works when you see the complexity in it, but all you\u2019re really doing is you\u2019re amplifying that waveform, whereas, with digital, you are dealing with ones and zeros. And you\u2019re using sophisticated converters that are trying to operate quickly so that the ear can be fooled into hearing a replication of the analog waveform and they\u2019ve gotten really good.\nDigital edits can be great, but when there\u2019s an analog master available, we always use it 100% of the time. We have done some releases \u2014 a couple of Joe Henderson records, some of the more modern stuff that were all recorded in the digital era \u2014 so there is no analog master. And those have come out in the Tone Poet series, but we make it clear that those are the sources we used. We use amazing converters, and we get great results. But if there\u2019s an analog master that\u2019s what we use, 100%. If they can\u2019t find it or it doesn\u2019t exist then I don\u2019t put it out.\nSome hardcore fans are a bit critical that the series is putting out stereo records instead of mono, like the originals. How did you decide to go with stereo?\nIn the realm of Blue Note collectors of original releases, I am one of them.\u00a0 I have tons and tons of original Blue Notes and a lot of people got into collecting the monos, which is great. There\u2019s no right or wrong about it. To me, when we first started doing this back in 2007 at Music Matters we started to hear for the first time the actual master tapes. The goal changed from what we thought when we started: We thought we should try to make them as much like the original record as possible. When we heard the masters, it was shocking how incredible those things were. I thought I knew a record that I\u2019ve heard my whole life, and then I heard \u201cCool Struttin\u2019\u201d put up the master tape. Our goal changed right then. We wanted to bring people back to what happened that day in the studio. Let\u2019s try to bring them right to the event.\nAnd if you think about when you go to a jazz club, let\u2019s say, and you\u2019re sitting there in the front row, you\u2019re not going to hear the horn players, the bass player, the piano player, the drummer all lined up in the center. They would never do that. They\u2019re spread out on a stage. In the era when Blue Note just started, they didn\u2019t have stereo, so everything Rudy recorded from 1953 up to the beginnings of 1957 was all mono to begin with. When we release those, which we have and will continue to do so, they\u2019re mono because that\u2019s all there is.\nLater, Rudy starts recording in stereo and an interesting thing happens that I was unaware of until we started looking at the master tapes. Those master tapes, all say something on the bottom. Each one says, \u201cMo master\u201d; mo meaning monaural master. \u201cMo master made 5050 from stereo.\u201d What Rudy did was, the recordings were all in stereo \u2014 to get mono. This is a little bit of an overstatement, but if you have a mono button on your preamp, you could do the same thing. There\u2019s a little bit more to it than that, but there was only one master and that master was stereo. He summed the channels to get mono so that he didn\u2019t have to have two machines going at the same time.\nYou get to the modern era and it really hasn\u2019t changed, you know? It keeps growing and morphing. Blue Note has always been about keeping ears to the ground and presenting, as they say in the logo, \u201cThe finest in jazz\u201d.\nHow does Blue Note fit into the history of jazz? What's Blue Notes\u2019 place in it all?\nWell, they started in 1939, and the initial releases were by these Boogie Woogie piano players, Midlux Lux Lewis and Albert Ammons, and some others. The two guys who started the label were both Jewish German immigrants. In fact, they got out of Germany right before the war. They ended up in New York and they had seen some concerts in Berlin as they were growing up and knew they loved the Black American music that they\u2019d seen.\nThey didn\u2019t have much money, found these boogie woogie players and arranged for a recording session. They recorded these guys, pressed up some records, sold them at a few record shops as best they could and that\u2019s how\u00a0Blue Note started.\nHistorically though, Blue Note introduced so many things in the history of modern jazz. Like Thelonious Monk, his first records were for Blue Note. Nobody would touch him because he was considered commercially a non-entity, I mean, musicians loved him and Francis and Alfred liked what they heard. They knew it was important. And even though the records weren\u2019t selling, they kept making records with Thelonious Monk. We\u2019re talking about the late \u201840s at this point. Then the music began to morph. You had bebop like Charlie Parker and all that.\nBlue Note was really key to documenting all of that. That\u2019s where that really came from, and then you go all through the \u201850s and \u201860s, and you\u2019ve got Blue Note continuing its hard bop roots, but morphing into the avant garde, and then in the 70s funk starts to be an element in jazz.\nIt goes to the whole point that jazz isn\u2019t static music. It\u2019s ever-changing,\u00a0 and Blue Note was too. Those two guys had their ears to the ground and knew all the musicians.\nYou get to the modern era and it really hasn\u2019t changed, you know? It keeps growing and morphing. Blue Note has always been about keeping ears to the ground and presenting, as they say in the logo, \u201cThe finest in jazz\u201d.\nI think it's really important to underscore the idea of documentation. I feel like that gets lost when people think about vinyl or just recordings in general that it is a documentation of a moment, which is very special. Was that a concept that was thought about when Blue Note started?\nWithout a doubt. For both Alfred Lion and Francis Wolfe, documenting the music was paramount to them and remains to be incredibly important with the current label.\nWe\u2019re not dealing in an area where we\u2019re talking about millions and millions of records being sold. This is not the top 10 or anything, so there\u2019s an element of art that\u2019s really important and Blue Note has really always stood for that. We want to sell records and keep going, so there\u2019s an element of \u2018Gotta stay in business,\u2019 but the artistic element is really the primary goal.\nI read that Charles Lloyd and the Marvels are kicking off this next series starting in March with a brand new record. Can you tell us a bit about that? I\u2019m sure that\u2019s special to you since he gave you the \u201cTone Poet\u201d nickname.\nCharles and I have known each other for many years and we\u2019ve always been working together.\u00a0I think we started working together in the early \u201890s. He was on ECM at that time and we began to do sessions together. And I noticed my credit on those records would be \u201cJoe Harley, Tone Poet,\u201d and I was doing what normally would be considered production work. I\u2019d be in the studio to help run the sessions and that sort of thing. I still get emails from him almost everyday and they always say something like, \u201cMy dear TP.\u201d\nAnd I mean, I\u2019ve never tried to say, \u201cCharles, what do you mean by that,\u201d because we don\u2019t really talk in that way, but I think he knows someone\u2019s really caring about the presentation of sound that is honoring the music. I believe that\u2019s what he means. And Don Was would hear Charles call me that all the time. Don actually suggested using it as the name of the series, and I was okay with it.\nI also love that tone has the other meaning of when you're creating an atmosphere or mood as well. At least from my perspective, you do create a very special mood with your work and especially with this series..\nThank you, that\u2019s great to hear. When trying to come up with what to release, I get asked a lot, \u201cWell, how do you pick the titles?\u201d I listen to music all the time and with Blue Note plus its subsidiaries, it\u2019s endless. You keep thinking it\u2019s finite and you\u2019ll get to the bottom or the end but you never do. And I sequence the release in a way that I hope is interesting to people. Is there a formula? Nope. It\u2019s just totally by feel.\nIt\u2019s unbelievable how much they recorded, and they recorded so much that they lost the tracks of what they had, so things didn\u2019t come out.\u00a0There were occasions, although not as many as you might think, where a record didn\u2019t come out because the session was substandard in some way. But by and large, it was the case that many artists would ask \u201cWell, why didn\u2019t you put this out?\u201d and the label would say, \u201cWe were so busy.\u201d Frequently the artist would respond saying, \u201cOh, I got something much better now. Check out my new music.\u201d They might have been getting ready to pick up the old one, but they would go along with it so that session would get shelved and lost in the shuffle \u2014 essentially forgotten.\nIt\u2019s really nice to be able to take the time and go through everything.\u00a0 When you listen to them fresh, you find so much stuff that is absolutely as worthy as anything that came out. It just didn\u2019t see the light of day.\nAre there some especially notable upcoming releases that you want to kind of talk a little bit more about?\nAndrew Hill\u2019s 1969 albumPassing Ships. Andrew Hill is another one of these singular artists that you know his music the minute you hear it, in the same way when you hear Monk, you just know. You can listen for five seconds to go, \u201cOkay, that\u2019s Monk.\u201d Andrew Hill\u2019s the same way. He has such a stylistically singular way of dealing with harmony and harmonic structure.\u00a0The record is made with a larger band that has been a favorite forever, but it was only released originally on CD. This release will be the first time this has ever been on vinyl, so that\u2019s highly exciting to me. It\u2019s all been mixed to analog so it\u2019s analog all the way. That\u2019s coming out very shortly, and that one\u2019s important to me.\nThere\u2019s a record by two artists that most people will go, \u201cI have no idea who these people are,\u201d but the musicians are Curtis Amy and Dupree Bolton. It\u2019s calledKatanga!and I can\u2019t wait for it to come out because I think people are going to be just shocked. I have test pressings and when I play it for people, it\u2019s always the same. They always say, \u201cWow, who are these guys?!\u201d.\nIn Dupre Bolton\u2019s case, it\u2019s a sad story. He\u2019s a brilliant trumpet player right there with Lee Morgan or anyone you want to mention. He had his own voice but he spent a lot of time in prison. And so only was afforded a few opportunities to record. This is one of them, and it\u2019s a record that sort of transcends the great musicianship. The tunes are amazing. It\u2019s soulful. I was playing it the other night and thinking that this is one of those perfect records. It puts you in a place that is so deep, and so I\u2019m excited about that.\nIt\u2019s hard to pick. It\u2019s like you have 100 children, let\u2019s say, which one is your favorite child? We did one the other day and it was important to me. It\u2019s a record from Gerald Wilson, who was LA based and he was a big band arranger composer. So many great players came through his band, and his son is Anthony Wilson. We were mastering a record calledMoment of Truth, which is one of Gerald\u2019s greatest records. And even in the era of COVID, we\u2019re all masked up when we\u2019re mastering and I asked Anthony if he wanted to come by because we were doing his dad\u2019s record. He came over and as soon as he came in, the tapes went up and sounded ridiculously amazing. It ended up being very emotional. When you\u2019re hearing those masters on a great set-up like at our mastering studio, it\u2019s like his dad\u2019s alive and you\u2019re hearing it like they\u2019re there.\nThere\u2019s also a Grant Green record that\u2019s calledFeelin\u2019 The Spirit, which is a record that a lot of people think may be one of the greatest things he\u2019s ever done. It\u2019s all gospel music and it\u2019s just amazing. Herbie Hancock\u2019s on that record and he just \u2014 it\u2019s some of the best supporting work I\u2019ve ever heard, just amazing.\nYou can follow Harley on Instagram at@jazzsarawatifor all of the behind the scenes footage of his work.\nBlue Note has announced the entire 2021-22 schedule for the Tone Poet Series, and will start with Charles Harley\u2019s new record \u201cTone Poem\u201d, on March 12th.\nBlue Note\u2019s 2021-2022 Schedule:http://www.bluenote.com/2021-2022-tone-poet-vinyl-series-line-up/"

        "content": "First introduced by the Klipsch speaker company as the center channel for the Klipschorn in 1957, the Heresy has for decades garnered a storied reputation among high-end audio enthusiasts. Made by hand in the US, this is a true high fidelity loudspeaker system.\nAt only 25 inches tall and weighing 25 pounds each, you can be easily fooled by their \u201ccompact\u201d size. It would be a mistake, however, to underestimate the power that resides within; they pack in a full 12-inch fiber composite woofer, a one-inch compression tweeter and a two-inch, mid-range compression driver.\nThey deliver ample power thanks to the company\u2019s signature horn-loaded construction, which is known for its dynamic range. They do what you want them to do without hesitation.\nWith the solid wood cabinet construction serving as a perfect amplification conduit, the Heresey looks beautiful. And with four wooden finishes (walnut, cherry, distressed oak or black), these units are sure to complement and blend in seamlessly with your listening surroundings.\nHeresy speakers are super balanced with a mid-range so spectacular that the three-dimensional, hefty presence feels larger than life. They sound sweet at any volume. When played low, you can feel the delicacy and intimacy \u2014 that sense of being in the room with the instruments themselves. The music comes to life with clarity; it has an oomph that can make you feel like you\u2019re actually within the music, even at quieter volumes.\nThe model also has a spectacular efficiency level of 99db sensitivity into 9ohms, resulting in a build that can be comfortably driven with amplification as low as five watts per channel. But up the volume and they can provide the wallop of a finely tuned muscle car and reach concert-level decibels.\nThe latest 4th generation Heresy IVs are spectacular for the price \u2014 at $3,000 a pair. They\u2019ve recently been given a new and improved overhaul, bringing even more energy, lushness and presence than\u00a0 previous models. For those on a budget, we highly recommend tracking down a used Heresy I or II from the 70\u2019s or 80\u2019s, which you can typically find on eBay or craigslist for about $750 with a bit of patience. A few members of the ISC staff actually have these as the main speakers in their home listening setups.\nNote: If you opt for a brand new pair, just remember that these speakers need to be broken in. High performance speakers require listening time for them to come into their own (kind of like a baseball glove). You\u2019ll need at least 500 hours of listening in order to bring life to the bass driver and for the tweeter to soften up a little, as it will be tight and bright to start. Obviously, if you\u2019re buying used this most likely won\u2019t be an issue. Regardless, you\u2019re in for a treat.\nVisit Klipsch for more information:https://www.klipsch.com/products/heresy-iv-floorstanding-speaker\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing ispowered by its patrons.

        "title": "Intro to Hi-fi Audio: Vintage Edition",
        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/intro-to-hi-fi-audio-vintage-edition/",
        "content": "It\u2019s a hotly debated topic when upgrading or investing in hi-fi gear: Do you buy vintage or go new? New components offer superior technology, argue  some. The classic stuff exudes a warmth lacking in new models, offer others. Each argument has validity. What you buy depends on what you need, and the better informed you are the easier it\u2019ll be to draw your own conclusions.\nPart oneof our intro to hi-fi audio series took you through the basics of setting up a home audio system. The following primer will dive into the basics of vintage gear, things to consider before purchasing and a few brands and models that we recommend.\nAmong the biggest selling points of going vintage is cost. It will be way cheaper going used when assembling your dream set-up, and you can find surprising deals if you know how to look. Whether via an online auction site such as Ebay, a reputable online marketplace likewww.audiogon.com,reverb.comorwww.usaudiomart.com, or even a lucky thrift store or Craigslist find, these units can be pretty easy to procure at a good price.\nIt will take more effort, though, and buying used stuff is a riskier proposition. In more cases than not, a component won\u2019t come with more than a handshake agreement, and repairs to might run a few hundred dollars. But because your initial investment will be lower than a newer alternative, this risk is somewhat minimized. Still, with online auctions, secondary market marketplaces, thrift shops, buyer beware. If you\u2019re not careful you could wind up with a piece that shorts out after a few months or needs a total refurbishment.\nDon\u2019t let this discourage you. Online audiophiles on forums such asAudioholics,AVS Forum, orAudiogonhave opinions on virtually any brand or model of note, and many love sharing information.\nMany reputable \u2018after market\u2019 dealers do stand behind their products and guarantee them with a limited warranty. Expect some general wear and tear, but usually a quick cleaning, tune up or \u2018recap\u2018 can get this gear up to speed.\nThe 1970\u2019s saw peak demand for stereo equipment, and a range of mass-market receivers built in this era are highly coveted. Because most everyone had a stereo in those days, there are a lot of models out there and  companies including Pioneer, Marantz, Harman Kardon, Sony and Kenwood heavily invested in making stuff sound good.\nStereo receivers had an outstanding build quality, and remain as solid state as they come. Vintage Pioneer, Harman Kardon and Marantz units have a deep sound: smooth, balanced, incredibly clear and pleasing to the ear. While the midrange frequency curve is not as precise compared with some newer amplifiers, what they lack in precision and finesse they make up for in bass depth, rolled-off sound and value. Throw in the streamlined, classic \u201870s aesthetic \u2014 the sublime orange, blue or green glow of the meters, the tactile feel of the knobs, the resistance in both the tone controls and balance, the giant flywheel tuning knob \u2014 and these machines are pure art. For what they are and what they currently cost, the ability to develop a relationship and live with these audio machines can bring endless listening pleasure.\nA few other incentives to going used: many vintage units were built with moving magnet phono pre-amps that are on par with, if not better than,  many stand-alone phono pre amps being sold today. As well, most vintage receivers come with built in AM/FM tuners, a big selling point back in the day that\u2019s more bonus these days. Not only is it fun to wheel through the radio dial again on these rigs, but more important, it\u2019s a good idea to have a working radio signal in the house just in case the internet goes down. Most people don\u2019t even realize that they don\u2019t have a radio receiver in the house, and in emergencies they are essential.\nDon\u2019t forget, though: vintage amps don\u2019t have remote control, have limited auxiliary inputs and no digital capacity to speak of. That said, such issues can be easily resolved by adding a relatively inexpensive DAC streaming device.\nA quick diversion: In the 80\u2019s, the audio business shifted with consolidation and manufacturing shortcuts; the sector became as much about advertising, looks and wattage stats as quality sound. Cheaper materials were employed and solid state transistors were abandoned for microchips. With these shifts, much of the sound vibrancy, explosiveness and depth was lost. In essence, life went out of amplifiers in the 80\u2019 and 90\u2019s. This is why, if you\u2019re thinking of going vintage, it\u2019s best to stick to something from the 1970\u2019s heyday.\nThe major evolution across the past 50 years has been in the resolution and imaging of today\u2019s components. Whereas old-school vintage equipment seems to produce a more intimate, subtle sound, new amplifiers from companies such as NAD and Cambridge Audio are more aesthetically minimalist and often lack the warm glow and the smoothness of vintage. They compensate for this in precision, particularly the overall spatial separation and soundstage. New-build high end amplification gear tends to have much more wattage to drive any set of speakers. They have built-in modern adaptability features \u2014 such as a plethora of inputs, digital capability, Bluetooth and remote control.\nAdditional Recommendations:\nThe major selling point for vintage speakers are the cabinets, usually made of solid wood for a wonderfully dynamic, room-consuming sound. The best are beautifully crafted and, in some cases, can be as big as pieces of furniture (See:Klipschorn corner speaker).\nMost vintage speakers have a paper-cone woofer with dome metal tweeters. This construction creates an airy resonance that results in a live-sounding acoustic warmth. Their wide-ranging frequency response remains up to today\u2019s standards and they can be driven with pretty much any amplifier. This is one reason why speaker companies like Klipsch still use many of the same materials as a half-century ago \u2014 for that\u00a0spacial feeling that\u2019s both balanced and responsive. But know that you\u2019ll need some space in your listening room for the most massive of them.\nAlso know that buying vintage speakers more than 20-years-old will often require replacing the foam around woofers. The process can be complicated and expensive, so before buying\u00a0always ask when they were last refoamed.\nNewer speaker models are generally, but of course not always, smaller \u2014 see bookshelf speakers \u2014 and come in a variety of finishes. Some are built from solid compost materials\u00a0\u2014 high density plastics and lacquer consistent with a tighter, more precise sound path and better sound separation. But these modern beauties, in spite of their technical merits, can sometimes sound a little sterile and synthetic when compared with their wooden-cabinet counterparts.\nWhile some of the newer speakers (Martin Logan, Paradigm) blow the frequency response of older speakers out of the water, they often require a lot of power and can only perform with mega-wattage modern amps. Which is to say, be careful with your pairing.\nAdditional Recommendations:\nTurntables are the exception here. Things have changed in favor of more modern players. Because turntables have more moving parts, acquiring fully intact used turntable requires hunting; chances are you\u2019ll have to replace something \u2014 the tone arm lever, belts, the footers to level properly or a cracked dust cover. Given the scarcity of some parts, replacing broken systems can be tough.\nIf you\u2019re hellbent on classic \u201870s design to round out the look of your system, though, when shopping for old turntables make sure you look for one with an adjustable tone arm that fits standard cartridges. Ninety-percent of a turntable\u2019s sound quality comes from the cartridge (the other 10% stems from a turntable\u2019s quietness), so if the sound coming from your turntable isn\u2019t working for you, upgrading the cartridge will more likely solve the problem.\nWhich is to say, spend less on the turntable and more on the cartridge.\nAdditional Recommendations:\nWith audio gear, most of time the main factor in getting quality sound is the combination of equipment you team together. If you put the wrong vintage amp with the wrong modern speakers, you could be disappointed. The trial-and-error process of matching audio gear will really affect the sound of your system. If in doubt, find someone who knows what they\u2019re doing. Audiophiles are an opinionated lot.\nAlso know that there\u2019s nothing wrong with mixing and matching pieces from different eras to find the optimal sound. Just don\u2019t be sucked in by the bells and whistles of newer gear \u2014 and pay less attention to wattage and sampling bit rates, two metrics that can be very misleading.\nMore important is the emotional pull and connection you get when you\u2019re intensely listening to music. If your system\u2019s sound relaxes you and delivers contentment and a smile, then you\u2019ve reached the summit of hi-fi listening.\nIn the following weeks, we\u2019ll be diving into specific gear mentioned in this piece with detailed information on suggested price, sound, pairings, and more.

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/more-on-the-room-recordings/",
        "content": "The room recordings on the ISC website are meant to start a conversation. A discussion about sound, ceremony and industry. They\u2019re also an argument in favor of a specific kind of experience in active listening: We are selecting pressings of albums from our collection,\u00a0 spinning them on a specific sound system in a well-designed environment and capturing those playbacks with specific mic set-ups.\nDo these room recordings sound different than what\u2019s heard on streaming platforms? Absolutely. Do they sound better? That\u2019s your call.\nThe latest room recordings were done in our new listening space at the ISC HiFi office. You might notice a different sound from the first ones. The following gear was used for these sessions:\nKlipsch Cornwall Speakers\nEico HF-81 Amplifier\nGarrard 301 Turntable\nThomas Schick Tonearms, Headshells & Cartridges\n2 x Blue Dragonfly Microphones\nJust as appreciating music is a subjective experience, our mind and body feel sonic vibrations based on how we listen. \u201cHigh-fidelity\u201d can be defined along a broad spectrum, but it boils down to excellent sound reproduction. The optimal hi-fi equipment contains no audible noise or distortion; and an untinted, neutral frequency response that resides in the sweet spot of the human hearing range.\nSome audiophiles argue that compact discs sound better than vinyl, and have differing\u00a0 perspectives on sound quality among streaming platforms. Thankfully, there are more options than ever when it comes to high-definition streaming platforms, Tidal HiFi, Amazon HD, Qobuz and Apple among them. Do the distinctions matter to more than a small subset of consumers? Probably not. Should they matter more? I believe so.\nThe goal of our in-room re-recordings of albums on the ISC site isn\u2019t to suggest an \u201coptimal\u201d way to consume this music digitally. In fact, from a fidelity perspective, the streaming service links and embeds we use are of higher quality. Some of these recordings might even be a bit noisy.\u00a0We just wanted to experiment.\nIt\u2019s true: We don\u2019t have licenses in place for the room recordings. It\u2019s also true that we\u2019re not collecting any streaming revenue, which is likely why no one has issued a take-down notice. Inevitably, that will happen, and when it does we want to make it easy for rights holders by\u00a0 licensing a passthrough approval. That will allow us to continue this experiment and argument while promoting albums in our collection. Hopefully, it will help propel the conversation regarding recorded audio and the various modes of playback.\nThe business side of streaming is a lot muddier then it should be. You\u2019d think that as accounting becomes automated, the ability to monetize streaming royalties would be more streamlined. I have found this to not be the case. The ways in which streaming money eventually trickles down to creators also seems antiquated. In Sheep\u2019s Clothing isn\u2019t aiming to make money on room recordings that we feature on our site. We consider ourselves to be a discovery platform that curates albums. Eventually, our plan is to release our own exclusive pressings on the platform in collaboration with some of our favorite labels, distributors and \u2014 of course \u2014 the creators themselves.\nOur argument is pretty basic: It\u2019s important to listen to music. It\u2019s important to listen to entire sides of albums, and commit to focusing on whole works. That\u2019s definitely true of the room recordings we feature on this platform. The records are brilliant from start to finish, and to truly understand the artists\u2019 intent you need to go deep into both sides.\nIf you are a rights holder of any music we showcase on the site and have questions, please\u00a0 reach out to us directly at[email\u00a0protected].\nThank you again for listening."

The film follows discoveries and advances in sound technology from Edison\u2019s phonograph all the way to surround sound and provides perspective on how sound designers in film and music influenced and inspired each other.\nFor instance, as George Martin introduced stereo phasing in Beatles records, the architect of modern sound design Walter Murch introduced stereo to the silver screen. Murch not only found inspiration inRevolverbut cites New York minimalist John Cage as a major influence on his approach to soundtracking as well as musique concr\u00e8te pioneers Pierre Henry and Pierre Schaffer. Another section shows how Tomita\u2019s quadraphonic albumThe Planetsinspired Francis Ford Coppola to build the first multi-speaker theater system.\nAll in all, the documentary is a beautiful contemplation on sound and fidelity.

        "content": "Kamran V builds bridges between technology and artistry. He\u2019s a producer, sound artist, designer, and engineer who has been working with spatial sound since the early 2000\u2019s. His work with Moogfest, Interscope and SONOS Studio has led to projects with artists as diverse as Beck, Nine Inch Nails and Suzanne Cianni. In 2018, his label CyKiK released Cianni\u2019sLIVE Quadraphonic,the first quadraphonic vinyl release in more than 30 years.\nLast year, through the support of the National Endowment of the Arts, Kamran collaborated with non-profit radio stationdublabto develop theQuadraphonic Universally Accessible Resource Kit (QUARK), a free software plugin that allows music makers and listeners to easily create and distribute quadraphonic spatial sound.\nThe next phase of the effort continues with a project launching called Make Music in Space (MMS). MMS is a national call for submissions to develop immersive quadraphonic work utilizing QUARK. The first call for submissions opens today with the creative prompt \u201cBreathing Space.\u201d The review panel includesSuzanne Ciani,Laura Escud\u00e9,Laraaji,Craig Leon, andTimeboy.\nFind more information about QUARK and Make Music in Space here:https://quark.cykik.com/\nWe spoke to Kamran about his history with spatial sound and why he believes the quadraphonic format can be a bridge to the future.\nHow did you first get into quadraphonic sound?\nWhen I was a kid, you\u2019d have your A&B speakers on your receiver, and I remember borrowing my brother\u2019s or my parents\u2019 speakers to have 2 speakers on each channel. Later on, I got a boombox and would route that to the other channels to create a pseudo-surround experience. It wasn\u2019t really any sort of real surround sound, but these early experiments allowed me to perceive sound in a new way and get my brain exploring the possibilities.\nMy first proper surround experience was through my neighbor Ron Smith who had a real surround sound receiver, playing a scene from his Top Gun VHS. Then being from Oklahoma, I heard the Flaming Lips doing the experiments leading toZaireeka. It blew my mind.\nYears later, I was able to produce some surround sound records while working at Interscope and started to research quadraphonic releases of the 1970s. Before then, I\u2019d always known that quad records and eight tracks existed but never really tangibly thought of it. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what many people think of quad today; some old format from the 1970s.\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t until I was producing Moogfest that I got deep into true quadraphonic sound. Inspired by Suzanne Cianni\u2019s sudden return to the quad-native buchla synth after 40 years away, I really dove in head first. We already had artists challenging themselves with 3-5 hour \u201cdurational performances\u201d at Moogfest and then decided to take it one step further, making them quadraphonic. It was really fun.\nFor those that aren\u2019t familiar, can you give a basic background on quadraphonic sound?\nThere are two concepts to consider when thinking about quad. First, there\u2019s the idea of sending audio to four discreet speakers. This has been around for a long time and the Buchla 200 synth that Suzanne is known for using pioneered this concept in performance in the \u201860s.\nThen there\u2019s the method of how to get more than two channels of audio on two channel formats like vinyl and radio\u2026 In the late 60s the ideas around this came about and several companies got into this part, the most widely used method was a way to use audio phasing to fold two channels into four channels then using a magic box to unfold the two channels back to four.\nWhen you see records that say that they\u2019re in quad, many of which were usually the QS or SQ formats. It was kind of a VHS vs Beta kind of situation. QS was the better performing Japanese format and SQ was the American one with more releases. Same story\u2026 in the end, everyone failed until Dolby applied all of this stuff to film. This is how my neighbor Ron Smith was able to get surround sound out of his Top Gun VHS tape.\nHow difficult was it to set up those quadraphonic performances back then at Moogfest?\nDoing quadraphonic now versus doing it in the 1960\u2019s is drastically different. Probably the biggest difference is that now we have these vector based computer panners where in the past you had to mechanically pan things or use voltage controls, which is what Suzanne does with her Buchla 227 module in her Buchla 200 synth.\nThe Buchla 227 is a quadraphonic module invented by Don Buchla that allows you to route audio signals based on voltage. It was just very difficult to do quadraphonic in the past. Today, now that we have these programs, it\u2019s much easier. Most of the audio interfaces have four outputs or more, you just have to know how to route it. It\u2019s just a matter of getting your brain wired to it.\nDuring my time doing Moogfest, I had this epiphany while on a trip to Athens, Georgia. I was traveling with a friend who I was working with at Moogfest and one of his close friends had just passed. We did an installation of Suzanne\u2019s work in a massive field. I had a really crazy, emotional experience listening to the sounds while watching my friend mourn, and all of a sudden something Suzanne told me clicked. She said \u201cQuad is musical.\u201d All of that inspiration showed me the way forward and how this old format could build a bridge to the future.\nTell us about the new Quadraphonic Universally Accessible Resource Kit (QUARK) that you\u2019ve developed in collaboration with dublab.\nQUARKis a free software plugin which encodes and decodes Quadraphonic spatial sound in real time, allowing anyone to easily distribute Quadraphonic music through all existing media including vinyl, radio, streaming video such as YouTube and music services such as iTunes and Spotify. The thesis of it is to create opportunities for music makers in all kinds of paths in spatial sound like VR, for instance.\nWe\u2019re getting closer and closer to this virtual world. As these worlds are being made, there\u2019s more and more interest or demand for creating a similar vibe in those spaces that we had in real life. Spatial music is one of those components. If people are making music today and want to have opportunities now and into the future, if they just start making their music with quad as their master, then it opens up a lot of possibilities for VR, Dolby Atmos, etc. and all they\u2019re doing is using QUARK to make their music fit current distribution channels while preparing their music for future opportunities.\nThe musicality of it is that it\u2019s more accessible, that\u2019s what clicked in my mind working with Suzanne. It\u2019s more natural to think in this way.\nDoing spatial music seems so complicated and unattainable. It\u2019s like I want to make my song and I want to put it out so people can hear it easily on Spotify, for instance. I also want to do spatial music but I don\u2019t want to have to do a whole other mix of my song for that. The QUARK plugin allows you to start your creative process in quadraphonic space with the benefit of these amazing vector based panners allowing you to potentially render your music to as many channels as you want. Hypothetically, all of these phantom centers in your quad studio could be real speakers in Atmos, if you want. QUARK makes it easy for you as a creative person to commit to making spatial music from the start of the process, and do it in the simplest way possible; with four speakers.\nYou\u2019ve said in previous interviews that the quadraphonic format lends itself much better to music making. Why is that?\nTo me, it\u2019s the simplification. It\u2019s easier to translate your emotion into four channels than six channels (5.1). As a listener, it\u2019s also less intimidating. The musicality of it is that it\u2019s more accessible, that\u2019s what clicked in my mind working with Suzanne. It\u2019s more natural to think in this way.\nWhen I was working at Interscope, I made a few records in 5.1 surround sound with Beck and Nine Inch Nails. It was so much work and also just so difficult for people to think in surround sound. I realized the second you remove the center speaker and the sub as something to think about, it just opens your mind. You can think of four speakers better than you can think of 5.1. It\u2019s just a weird psychological twist.\nThe technology for quadraphonic has been around since the 60\u2019s but sometimes, like in this case, it takes looking back to be able to look forward. Sometimes, we forget to look back at these things. I think on an emotional or even cultural standpoint, this is where quadraphonic seems to resonate, it just feels more natural.\nYou released Suzanne Cianni's amazing LIVE Quadraphonic album a few years ago. Any other upcoming projects/releases you\u2019d like to share?\nI\u2019m working on a quadraphonic record with Patrick Gleeson. It\u2019s a jazz record but it\u2019s far out! He really did a lot of the hard work inspiring people through his albums with Herbie Hancock. He\u2019s been in the middle of a lot of pivotal things. I don\u2019t why, but I\u2019m working with a lot of legendary musical veterans like Suzanne, Gleeson, and Morton Subotnick. It\u2019s shocking how on-it they are with the technology. All of them are just going for it. I hope I\u2019m that with it as I get older.\nI have another project coming out with Bedrock.LA and dublab calleddecades (in space)that\u2019s all quadraphonic. It\u2019s ten songs by twenty artists, because it was Bedrock\u2019s 10th anniversary and dublab\u2019s 20th. Emily from Warpaint and Suzanne Cianni did one. Laura Escud\u00e9 and Sudan Archives did one. Laraaji and Beatie Wolfe\u2026 It\u2019s all completely original compositions. Part of the idea was challenging these artists and giving them license to go outside of their usual realm. It may be the first compilation album of music made specifically for quadraphonic listening.\nLastly, what are a few albums you wish were available in quadraphonic?\nI\u2019ve actually talked with some labels about releasing old stuff in quadraphonic. Personally, I\u2019d love to do Beastie Boys\u2019The In Sound from Way Out!, Beck\u2019sMidnight Vultures, Public Enemy\u2019sFear of a Black Planet, or anything Prince\u2026 It starts to be really fun to rediscover music in that way. You see that already with the way they\u2019ve remixed old catalogs from Elton John, Bowie, etc. It\u2019s happening, but very specifically. It\u2019s all very sales oriented and expensive, but this plugin will hopefully make things less expensive and accessible to more artists."

        "content": "It would behoove every listener-collector\u00a0 \u2014 vinyl freaks and Hi-Fi heads included \u2014 to consider subscribing to a streaming service, politics be damned. Yes, royalty payments to your favorite musicians are paltry at best, insulting at worst. But artists make zero dollars from Discogs sales; however rare, once a record gets on the secondary market the profit stream is dead for everyone except the seller.\nBut this isn\u2019t an op-ed in favor of the streaming model, which seems fundamentally broken, at best. Rather, we\u2019re looking to bridge the seeming divide between vinyl-only enthusiasts and the format-neutral collectors who use streaming services as one tool in the endless quest to feed the musical beast.\nWhich is to say, if you\u2019re going to stream, the experience may as well sound as close to incredible as possible.\nAt the end of 2020, we highlighted the French-born high-definition streaming serviceQobuz, which launched in the U.S. two years ago. To start 2021, we\u2019re focusing on Amazon Music HD, which the mega-retailer launched last year as an add-on to its Amazon Music streaming service.\nWho: Amazon Music HD\nWhat: The high-definition tier of the mega-retailer\u2019s Amazon Music service, Amazon Music HD offers CD-quality streams for 70 million songs. As well, the platform has an ever-expanding bunch of albums given the \u201cUltra HD\u201d treatment \u2014 5 millions songs. Though light on editorial, the service taps into the company\u2019s database to offer a bounty of playlists.\nPrice: $12.99/month for Amazon Prime members and $14.99 for non-Prime customers.\nSales pitch, per Amazon Music HD: \u201cAmazon Music HD offers lossless audio in two quality ranges: HD and Ultra HD. HD tracks are 16-bit audio, with a minimum sample rate of 44.1 kHz (16/44.1 is also referred to as CD-quality) and an average bitrate of 850 kbps. Ultra HD tracks have a bit depth of 24 bits, with sample rates ranging from 44.1 kHz up to 192 kHz and an average bitrate of 3730 kbps.\n\u201cIn comparison, most standard streaming services currently offer Standard Definition (SD) with a bitrate up to 320 kbps. These audio files use lossy compression, where details of the original audio are removed in order to reduce the file size. By contrast, Amazon Music HD preserves the original recording information to deliver the highest quality sound available, more than 2x the bitrate in HD and more than 10x the bitrate at the highest Ultra HD bitrate.\u201d\nView from the inside: \u201cAmazon Music HD is really meant to provide that premium-listening, lossless sound experience to as wide an audience as possible,\u201d says Amazon Music\u2019s Stephen Brower, who handles artist relations. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I think is super exciting for music streaming in general because there\u2019s always been this trade-off of quality and convenience. And I think at a high level, what we\u2019re hoping to sort of accomplish is eliminating that trade-off and providing quality sound and convenience at the highest level available.\u201d\nCatalog:As expected, the company has tons of offerings in HD, but what\u2019s more stunning are the Ultra HD recordings, which provide so much wildly remarkable depth and clarity that at times it\u2019s hard to imagine any file sounding better. Listen to Prince\u2019s \u201cSign o\u2019 the Times\u201d or Janet Jackson\u2019s \u201cControl\u201d in Ultra HD and be transformed.\nTry Amazon Music HD for free for 30 days:https://www.amazon.com/music/unlimited/hd"

        "link": "https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/qobuz/",
        "content": "It\u2019s no secret that In Sheep\u2019s Clothing focuses on active listening and the depths to be explored within the grooves of great records. We sell and recommend physical products because of the tactile thrill of interacting with vinyl, jacket artwork and liner notes, and because to our ears a well-pressed record fed through a high-fidelity system sounds particularly awesome.\nBut we\u2019re not precious about it. A poorly-pressed piece of vinyl, for example, sounds particularly harsh on a nice system, and not all the new pressing plants coming onto the market are created equal.\nSo let\u2019s talk about high-fidelity music streaming platforms. From a sound standpoint, most major services have long weighed ease of delivery against quality of sound. As a result, the big services seem to hit at about FM radio quality.\nBut that\u2019s changing, and as a way to bridge the divide between the vinyl-only, tube-amp-or-die\u00a0 snobs and the earbud-sporting technologists who thrill at notion the so-called celestial jukebox (but wish it sounded better), In Sheep\u2019s Clothing is happy to present the first in a series that explores the new adventures in online Hi-Fi listening.\nWho:Qobuz\nWhat: Originally launched in the late \u201800s as an a la cart digital download platform for the European market, in 2015 the French company (pronouncedco-buzz) became the first streaming service to offer 24-bit resolution audio. In Feb., 2019, the company launched in the U.S.\nUnlike the landing pages of Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal and Amazon Music, which promote hits and exploits marketing opportunities in conjunction with the major labels, Qobuz highlights new and old\u00a0 jazz, classical, opera, experimental \u2013 all the stuff often pushed into the stacks on the big services.\nPrice:$14.99 a month\nSales pitch, per Qobuz:\u201cHi-Res Audio is dedicated to audio files that deliver sound with a quality superior to that of a CD. These files are encoded with 24-Bit resolution (as opposed to 16-Bit for CD quality). This is also called studio quality because 24-Bit resolution is used in a recording studio. The difference in richness of sound and feeling is very substantial compared to MP3 files or even CD quality.\u201d Though not all the platform\u2019s offerings are available in 24-bit audio, the vast majority of them are available as 16-bit, CD quality files.\nView from inside:\u201cWhen modern music is being recorded today in almost any kind of digital studio environment, they\u2019re recording in a 24-bit audio format,\u201d says Dan Mackta, who represents Qobuz in North America. \u201cThat gives the engineers and producers tons of capabilities that didn\u2019t exist digitally a few years ago \u2014 or on tape ever, in terms of what you can do with recording. Incredible recordings in every genre are being made. But then, the equivalent of making a photocopy is what the consumer is going to get. That\u2019s the mainstream streaming experience. And there\u2019s really no reason for that because the bandwidth and the hardware exist \u2013 every factor is available to listen to the music in the same quality that it\u2019s recorded in, essentially. Why would you want it any other way, if you care about the music?\u201d\nCatalog:Qobuz offers the same volume and variety of music as the major services. But for In Sheep\u2019s Clothing heads, the following fact can\u2019t be stressed enough: Qobuz is the only streaming platform that offers EVERY SINGLE RELEASE FROM JOHN ZORN\u2019S TZADIK RECORDS. That means dozens of full-length albums from Zorn and his wide circle of peers, none of which has ever been released on vinyl or to streaming services.\nIt means Boredoms-related noise projects and a host of other Japanese experimental music of the \u201890s and \u201800s, early musique concrete experiments from Luc Ferrari, solo and collaborative guitar albums from Derek Bailey, Fred Frith, Bill Frisell, Marc Ribot. Otherwise unavailable works by Wadada Leo Smith, Jim O\u2019Rourke, Steve Coleman, Wayne Horvitz, Nana Vasconcelos and Jon Gibson. Percussion records from Susie Ibarra, Ikue Mori and Harry Partch.\nCheck below for a few albums from our collection that are available to stream in \u201cHi-Res Audio\u201d on Qobuz."

        "content": "It doesn\u2019t get any more \u2018state of the art\u2019 than this, and one could argue the audio gear found atCommon Wave Hi Fi, located in the Arts District in downtown Los Angeles, is art itself. As owner Wes Katzir powers up the Nagra HD amplification gear, he explains that the tubular phono pre-amp has to warm up, so while we are waiting he\u2019s gonna play some high resolution files through one of the best Digital Audio Converters (DACs) on the market.\nAfter enthusiastically telling me about the new YG Acoustics Sonja 2.2 speakers, which have just arrived at the store and stand nearly six feet tall, he shows me the intricately woven cable wires that attach to the tube amplifier. Everything in this system has been well imagined, with each component carefully chosen to work in unison.\nIn another listening room I\u2019m led to yet another cozy leather couch and asked to sit in the sweet spot. This is the shop\u2019s latest marquee \u201cwow\u201d system, and Wes is very excited to demo it for me.\nCommon Wave is a well appointed audio equipment store that also sells records and accessories. With its polished concrete floors and beams, stylized modern Danish furniture and perfectly placed Persian carpets throughout, think of it more like the most comfortable industrial loft living space you\u2019ve ever been in, only surrounded by exquisite stereo gear. This is where Wes\u2019 background in architectural design and sound comes in.\nWes has built within these walls an audiophile\u2019s dream, a highly curated, acoustically designed music den where people can come to listen to music on high-end audio equipment the way it was intended to be heard. Within the vast loft space are no less than six different listening setups, ready to be played and demoed, with at least one system playing music at all times.\nIf you\u2019re into Miles Davis, they have the perfect speakers for you. If classic rock is more your thing, there is a complete amp and turntable combo ready to be auditioned.\nAny preconceived notions that digital streaming is a compromised format are quickly put to rest. What I was hearing was about as close as you can get to the original source. The clarity and precision of the music was something I had never experienced before \u2014 like being in the room where the music was originally recorded. An experience that has to be heard in person to be believed, it was simply stunning.\nThen it was time to put a record on the \u2018piece de resistance\u2019 Kuzma Stabi R turntable, and Wes selected an LP by French flautist Aurele Nicolettes. While one of the quietest records I\u2019d\u00a0 ever heard, it also had a warmth and presence.\nCommon Wave is also a well stocked record shop that stocks audiophile pressings, including one of the largest MOFI (Mobile Fidelity) collections in the city. You can find reissued jazz records on Blue Note and Three Blind Mice alongside albums by Aphex Twin and Nine Inch Nails. A miscellaneous section with great selections under $10 and even a few $1 bins where you may be able to find some used gems.\nIn other words, there\u2019s something to be found for every music lover in this musical oasis here in DTLA. You can walk in and spend a buck or two on a couple records or drop a cool million dollars on the best sounding stereo system ever made. Wes spoke to In Sheep\u2019s Clothing about the shop.\nHow long have you been in business?\nSince 2016, and two years here at the new location downtown.\nHow is biz these days?\nInitially it was kind of frightening, but the minute we opened up by appointment things got steady again. And we\u2019ve seen an increase during this time, actually. People are spending more time at home and they\u2019re appreciating their home entertainment systems. There\u2019s definitely been an uptick in turntable sales.\nWhat do you guys do other than sell stereo equipment and records?\nWe do full system design and installation of audio systems. We specialize in home audio and cinema. We also do custom sound calibration and vintage equipment modulation and repair.\nHow has the customer base changed?\nIt was a lot traditional audiophiles types when we started, but now people who are looking for great sound in their home are also interested in design choices and what incorporates into their living space. Highly functioning furniture or objects of art, are more the way we liked to think of audio equipment. It\u2019s translated to a new group of clients that respect that hi-fi is an experience they want to live in. We want you to interact with the gear. It\u2019s a tactile object that should be showcased and translated into a tactile listening experience. We want it to live beautifully in your home. A lot of people hid their stereos with Bose mini systems in the 80\u2019s, and now again with Sonos speakers.\nWhat are the trends in the biz these days?\nWe see music lovers more than audiophiles per se. Clients have become younger and more excited to showcase their equipment and find the pure joy of music.\nIn what order would you put the importance of components?\nNo. 1 are speakers. The speakers interact with your ear, they interact with your room and they interact with the electronics, so it\u2019s the one that will determine your experience \u2014 based on your room and your tastes.\nNo. 2 is the Source (i.e. turntable, DAC, CD player). It is where the signal originates. The source is going to let the speakers do their best job.\nNo. 3 is the amplifier. The piece that bridges the source to the speakers.\nNo. 4 are cables. Never underestimate the importance of quality cables.\nWhat are your thoughts on the digital vs. analog debate?\nThat\u2019s a difficult question to answer. Digital is better in a lot of ways: It\u2019s clear and pure, and it\u2019s noise free, so there is so much information with more frequencies. It\u2019s the best format we\u2019ve ever come up with for detail.\nSo why deal in analog?\nWhile they may not have as much dynamic range as files, records just feel more real. The music comes off the grooves with a spacial tonality. If the record engineer has done his or her job correctly, the music is brought into clearer moments of focus. Things happen in space more naturally, and feels like the master tape. The analogy can almost be summed up by digital photography versus developing film: You may get a more precise and micro-focused photo with digital, but with film there will be more of an emotional pull. Our customers are 60% digital and 40% analog but again, turntable sales are on the rise.\nWhere do you think Hi-Fi is going?\nIt\u2019s really exciting to see something that was on the decline have such a resurgence. The craft of two-channel stereo is coming back in a big way. There is an enthusiasm from the public. They want to bring audio into their home and make it an experience \u2014 the way it used to be. More and more people want to get together, listen to and talk about music again.\nVisit Common Wave\u2019s website to book an appointment:https://www.commonwave.net/"

That\u2019s because these recordings were made at In Sheep\u2019s Clothing using a pair of old ribbon microphones through a UAD Apollo AD converter to capture the sense of hearing records in that room. And that room was built with the intention of providing an optimal environment for serious listening. Since we opened, it has rewired a lot of brains.\nSoundsystem:\nKlipsch Klipschorn AK6 Loudspeakers\nAudio Note Jinro Shochu Tube Amplifier\nCondesa Carmen Rotary Mixer\nGarrard 301 Turntables\nThomas Schick Tonearms, Headshells & Cartridges\nRecording Engineer:Yohei Shikano\nThe Klipshorns needed to be situated in corners, so we built a separate set of corners in the room. Placing the speakers there provides a jumbo \u201csweet spot,\u201d one that\u2019s enhanced by the room\u2019s shape. Textured wood paneling covers most walls. Cork floors help prevent bounce.\nWe\u2019ve never claimed that this approach is better or best. We do believe strongly, though, that focused listening at ample volume in that room is a singular experience.\nOur intention with the (( ROOM RECORDINGS )) is to explore a new approach. Is it an analog recording? By definition, no. You\u2019re obviously hearing a digital replication. Still, while links to other streaming platforms will be provided for albums we are featuring, the (( ROOM RECORDINGS )) offer listeners a rich, atmospheric tone \u2014 hopefully a fresh perspective shaped by the space, the ribbon microphones and the sound system elements. We hope that these new recordings provide alternative listening experiences, or at least pose questions on how atmospheric elements shape the way we appreciate sound.\nNote: We are not collecting any income from these recordings and encourage our community to seek these albums out and purchase them for at-home listening pleasure."
