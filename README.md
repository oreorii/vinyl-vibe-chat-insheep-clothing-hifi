## About
I recently got hooked on the Hi-Fi community and got a full set of vintage audio gear with some vinyl records. Beyond the equipment, Iâ€™ve discovered a community that's warm, vibrant, and wonderfully low-key. This chat bot is my way of sharing the magic, spreading quality information about this amazing community, and fueling the love for quality music culture.

Most of the content comes from In Sheep's Clothing HiFi. I highly recommend their curated jazz playlist. This is a non-commercial fan project, passionately dedicated to promoting the vinyl and music culture we adore. The botâ€™s responses will cite source articles from In Sheep's Clothing to honor their originality.
